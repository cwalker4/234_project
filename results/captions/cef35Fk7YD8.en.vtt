00:00:09.948 --> 00:00:11.998
Hello, my name is Vanessa,

00:00:11.998 --> 00:00:14.964
and I am a recovering awkward person.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.921
(Laughter)

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.480
This is me at the peak of
what I like to call my plaid vest phase.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.202
(Laughter)

00:00:23.202 --> 00:00:25.852
Luckily, my years of social awkwardness

00:00:25.852 --> 00:00:30.713
led me to a fascinating career
trying to figure out how people work.

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:34.067
So, what I didn't realize
is that many years ago,

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:35.296
I would do an experiment

00:00:35.296 --> 00:00:38.576
that led me right on this stage
in front of you here today.

00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:43.005
My lab researchers and I
were curious about TED Talks.

00:00:43.395 --> 00:00:44.664
We wanted to know,

00:00:44.664 --> 00:00:47.805
Why do some TED Talks go viral 
and others don't?

00:00:48.297 --> 00:00:50.285
So we embarked on a huge experiment.

00:00:50.285 --> 00:00:54.425
We analyzed thousands of hours 
of TED Talks, looking for patterns.

00:00:54.591 --> 00:00:56.512
I wasn't sure if we would find anything,

00:00:56.515 --> 00:01:00.699
so we were analyzing body language,
hand gestures, vocal variety -

00:01:00.971 --> 00:01:03.140
we even looked at outfit choices,

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.700
which made today 
particularly pressure-filled.

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.698
And very quickly, there was a pattern
in the data that made me curious.

00:01:11.898 --> 00:01:14.498
And after we coded 
more and more TED Talks,

00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:16.450
we realized there was a pattern.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.827
Now, before I tell you what that is,
I have a personal question for you,

00:01:19.837 --> 00:01:22.478
which is, When you see someone,

00:01:22.485 --> 00:01:25.358
what part of the body
do you look at first?

00:01:25.358 --> 00:01:26.557
You can just call it out.

00:01:26.557 --> 00:01:28.812
What do you look at first 
when you see someone?

00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:31.912
Face, eyes - so most people -

00:01:31.912 --> 00:01:32.916
shoes.

00:01:32.916 --> 00:01:36.097
(Laughter)

00:01:37.095 --> 00:01:39.037
They are very high.

00:01:39.267 --> 00:01:43.977
So most people
say eyes, face or mouth.

00:01:44.195 --> 00:01:46.973
But actually, when we first see someone,

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:49.383
the first place we look is the hands.

00:01:49.718 --> 00:01:51.984
And this is left over 
from our caveman days.

00:01:51.984 --> 00:01:54.443
Because if we were approached
by a stranger caveman,

00:01:54.443 --> 00:01:56.301
the first place we looked was the hands

00:01:56.301 --> 00:01:58.490
to see if they were
carrying a rock or a spear.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.988
We wanted to know if we were safe,
if they were friend or foe.

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:05.247
Now, this actually still remains
from caveman days,

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:07.645
and when we can't see someone's hands,

00:02:07.645 --> 00:02:09.378
something interesting happens.

00:02:09.378 --> 00:02:11.858
So I just did something 
a little mean to your brain.

00:02:11.858 --> 00:02:15.301
You should start to feel 
just a little bit uncomfortable.

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:18.469
The reason for that is 
when you can't see my hands,

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.709
you wonder, What is she doing back there?

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:22.925
(Laughter)

00:02:22.925 --> 00:02:25.719
And then, the longer I leave
my hands behind my back,

00:02:25.974 --> 00:02:28.790
you get more and more distracted
because you can't see them.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.960
And eventually,
your brain is just screaming,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.721
Can't she just bring her hands off
from behind her back?

00:02:34.131 --> 00:02:36.003
And the moment I bring them back out,

00:02:36.971 --> 00:02:38.522
it feels so much better.

00:02:38.522 --> 00:02:41.573
And this because our brain knows
that if we can't see hands,

00:02:41.573 --> 00:02:43.073
we can't see intention.

00:02:43.398 --> 00:02:47.160
And we found as we compared
the most viewed TED Talks

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.300
side by side with
the least viewed TED Talks,

00:02:50.424 --> 00:02:52.702
we found a pattern with hand gestures.

00:02:52.702 --> 00:02:54.480
Specifically, on average,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.302
the most popular TED talkers
use an average of 465 hand gestures

00:03:00.302 --> 00:03:01.712
in 18 minutes.

00:03:02.042 --> 00:03:04.542
Yes, we painstakingly counted
every single one.

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:07.254
I have 465 prepared for you today.

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.562
(Laughter)

00:03:09.562 --> 00:03:15.242
And the least popular TED talkers 
use an average of 272 hand gestures.

00:03:15.334 --> 00:03:16.924
Almost half.

00:03:17.477 --> 00:03:18.785
What's happening here?

00:03:18.785 --> 00:03:21.212
So when TED speakers take the stage,

00:03:21.217 --> 00:03:23.735
they are showing you first
"Friend, friend, friend."

00:03:23.735 --> 00:03:26.306
You'll notice when I walked
onto the stage, I waved.

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:28.634
I was saying, "Friend,
friend, friend, friend."

00:03:28.636 --> 00:03:29.658
(Laughter)

00:03:29.658 --> 00:03:31.663
And the other thing that TED speakers do -

00:03:31.663 --> 00:03:33.283
see if this looks familiar.

00:03:33.402 --> 00:03:36.756
So they come onto the red dot,
and they do something like this.

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:42.626
"Today, I want to talk to you
about a big idea."

00:03:42.626 --> 00:03:44.200
(Laughter)

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.873
"I am going to break it down 
into three different areas

00:03:46.873 --> 00:03:49.511
that are going to change your life."

00:03:49.984 --> 00:03:50.994
Right?

00:03:50.994 --> 00:03:52.554
(Applause)

00:03:56.344 --> 00:03:58.307
So the most viral TED talkers

00:03:58.307 --> 00:04:01.012
seemed to sit in the same way
with these hand gestures

00:04:01.012 --> 00:04:03.516
because what they are doing is
they are showing you,

00:04:03.516 --> 00:04:05.630
"I know my content so well

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.760
that I can speak to you 
on two different tracks.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.533
I can speak to you with my words,

00:04:10.533 --> 00:04:14.123
but I can also explain
my concepts with my hands."

00:04:14.603 --> 00:04:17.533
And this way, they underline 
their concepts with their words.

00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:19.429
For example, if I were to say,

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.588
"Today, I have a really big idea."

00:04:23.593 --> 00:04:25.724
(Laughter)

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:27.140
"It's huge."

00:04:27.143 --> 00:04:28.596
(Laughter)

00:04:28.896 --> 00:04:32.602
You laugh, and you are like, "Vanessa,
it's so small, it's not very big,"

00:04:33.596 --> 00:04:39.049
and that is because your brain gives
12.5 times more weight to hand gestures.

00:04:39.214 --> 00:04:44.556
So today I have a really, really big idea,

00:04:45.476 --> 00:04:48.166
and I am going to explain it 
to you in three different ways.

00:04:48.296 --> 00:04:52.264
My big idea is that we are contagious.

00:04:52.324 --> 00:04:54.016
Specifically, as humans,

00:04:54.021 --> 00:04:58.416
we are constantly sending
and decoding body language signals.

00:04:58.416 --> 00:05:01.492
We also do this emotionally
and chemically.

00:05:01.806 --> 00:05:02.926
To explain this,

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.948
I have a rather disgusting
but very fascinating study.

00:05:07.727 --> 00:05:11.929
So, in this study,
researchers collected sweat pads

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:14.499
from people who ran on a treadmill.

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:16.553
Then they collected sweat pads

00:05:16.553 --> 00:05:20.073
from skydivers
on their first time skydive.

00:05:20.073 --> 00:05:21.717
Two very different kinds of sweat.

00:05:21.717 --> 00:05:23.054
Here is the disgusting part.

00:05:23.054 --> 00:05:26.300
Then they had poor 
unsuspecting participants -

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.448
(Laughter)

00:05:27.448 --> 00:05:28.453
I know -

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:30.847
they had unsuspecting 
participants in the lab

00:05:30.847 --> 00:05:31.889
(sniffing)

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.899
smell these sweat pads
while they were in an fMRI machine.

00:05:36.532 --> 00:05:38.438
Here's where it gets interesting.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:42.191
Even though the participants
had no idea what they were smelling,

00:05:42.494 --> 00:05:45.690
the ones that smelled 
the skydiving sweat pads

00:05:46.017 --> 00:05:48.953
had their fear response 
in their brain activated.

00:05:49.243 --> 00:05:52.438
In other words, they caught the fear.

00:05:53.917 --> 00:05:57.279
This means that 
our emotions are contagious.

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:00.489
Our fear is contagious.
Our confidence is contagious.

00:06:00.863 --> 00:06:02.863
And this begs the big question:

00:06:03.493 --> 00:06:05.553
If our emotions are contagious,

00:06:05.703 --> 00:06:09.503
how do we make sure that we are
infecting people with the right ones?

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.415
So, I believe that we can be
contagious in three different ways.

00:06:13.566 --> 00:06:15.274
The first one is non-verbally.

00:06:15.343 --> 00:06:16.624
Now, to test this idea,

00:06:16.624 --> 00:06:19.814
I did a very simple experiment 
in the streets of Portland, Oregon.

00:06:19.834 --> 00:06:22.209
What I did is I stood in the street,

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:24.409
and I looked up at nothing.

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:26.527
And I wanted to see

00:06:26.617 --> 00:06:29.656
if people would catch
or mirror my non-verbal.

00:06:30.006 --> 00:06:32.277
So you can see in this video,

00:06:32.277 --> 00:06:35.356
I stand in the streets looking at nothing,

00:06:36.226 --> 00:06:37.885
and slowly one by one ...

00:06:37.885 --> 00:06:39.546
(Laughter)

00:06:39.546 --> 00:06:41.176
I infect people walking by.

00:06:41.176 --> 00:06:42.618
(Laughter)

00:06:42.618 --> 00:06:43.773
And slowly ...

00:06:43.773 --> 00:06:46.080
(Laughter)

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.070
we begin to gather a crowd.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.940
(Laughter)

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.607
(Applause)

00:06:54.485 --> 00:06:57.454
This poor woman, you know -
she was standing there with me,

00:06:57.732 --> 00:07:00.922
and we are standing there,
and remember, we're looking at nothing.

00:07:01.347 --> 00:07:05.707
And we are standing, and I am going,
How long are we going to stand here?

00:07:06.006 --> 00:07:07.332
Who's going to break first?

00:07:07.332 --> 00:07:09.175
And after about 40 seconds,

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:12.353
we are looking,
and she leans over and says,

00:07:13.032 --> 00:07:14.218
"Is he going to jump?"

00:07:14.323 --> 00:07:17.924
(Laughter)

00:07:18.858 --> 00:07:23.505
And this experience taught me 
that we catch emotions,

00:07:23.727 --> 00:07:28.558
and then we create rationales
for why we've caught that emotion.

00:07:28.711 --> 00:07:30.478
Now, this is actually a good thing.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.387
As humans, this keeps us safe.

00:07:32.674 --> 00:07:35.864
Dr. Paul Ekman has studied something
called the microexpression.

00:07:35.865 --> 00:07:37.646
It's a universal facial expression,

00:07:37.652 --> 00:07:39.739
and he's discovered
there are seven of them.

00:07:39.739 --> 00:07:41.368
Across genders and races,

00:07:41.369 --> 00:07:44.907
we all make the same expression
when we feel an intense emotion.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.547
This is the fear microexpression.

00:07:48.286 --> 00:07:50.228
So, fear is a really important emotion

00:07:50.228 --> 00:07:52.591
because we want to catch it
from someone else

00:07:52.591 --> 00:07:54.941
to warn us if something
is about to go wrong.

00:07:55.222 --> 00:07:58.386
And this facial expression 
also keeps us safe.

00:07:58.718 --> 00:08:02.077
So imagine for a second
that you're walking and you see a snake.

00:08:02.636 --> 00:08:05.518
Your eyelids and your eyebrows
jump out of the way

00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:08.281
so you can take in as much 
of the environment as possible.

00:08:08.281 --> 00:08:10.657
"Is there another snake? 
What is my escape route?"

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:13.261
Then your mouth - "huh" - opens

00:08:13.261 --> 00:08:17.287
so you can take in oxygen in case 
you have to fight, yell for help, or flee.

00:08:17.928 --> 00:08:22.280
We make this face before 
we consciously realize we've seen a snake.

00:08:23.013 --> 00:08:25.304
Now, what's interesting about it

00:08:25.304 --> 00:08:28.044
is you should be starting
to feel a little bit anxious.

00:08:28.044 --> 00:08:30.469
That's because when we
see other people have fear -

00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:32.106
If we saw this face in the subway,

00:08:32.109 --> 00:08:34.428
we would be like,
What's wrong? What's going on?

00:08:34.428 --> 00:08:36.281
Because it keeps us safe.

00:08:36.281 --> 00:08:37.981
So I want you to try it with me.

00:08:37.981 --> 00:08:39.802
Open your eyes as wide as possible.

00:08:39.802 --> 00:08:41.624
Raise your eyebrows up. Very good.

00:08:41.624 --> 00:08:43.091
Now, take in a short breath.

00:08:43.091 --> 00:08:44.180
(Gasp)

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.204
Perfect.

00:08:45.204 --> 00:08:47.384
Do you feel anxious?

00:08:48.056 --> 00:08:50.277
What's interesting 
about facial expressions

00:08:50.277 --> 00:08:52.877
is they cause our emotions.

00:08:52.987 --> 00:08:55.354
So not only do our emotions
cause our face,

00:08:55.354 --> 00:08:57.714
but our face also causes our emotions.

00:08:57.714 --> 00:08:59.751
It's called the facial
feedback hypothesis.

00:08:59.751 --> 00:09:03.328
So when we see someone with this face,
we catch their emotion,

00:09:03.448 --> 00:09:06.858
and then we are ready to fight, 
flee, or yell for help.

00:09:07.378 --> 00:09:10.328
Luckily, this also works
with positive emotions.

00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:14.369
So one of the faces behind me
is a real happiness microexpression,

00:09:14.369 --> 00:09:15.898
and one of them is fake.

00:09:17.347 --> 00:09:19.654
(Laughter)

00:09:20.735 --> 00:09:25.339
So the real happiness microexpression
is when the smile reaches all the way up

00:09:25.339 --> 00:09:28.849
into these upper crow's feet muscles,
those upper cheek muscles.

00:09:29.139 --> 00:09:30.470
And this is really important

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.510
because, you know,
when you tell a frenemy good news,

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.762
(Laughter)

00:09:34.762 --> 00:09:38.041
and they say they are happy for you,
but you know they are not really.

00:09:38.319 --> 00:09:42.154
It looks like this -
"Oh yeah, I am so happy for you."

00:09:42.154 --> 00:09:44.311
(Laughter)

00:09:44.311 --> 00:09:46.642
So try the fake expression for me first.

00:09:46.642 --> 00:09:49.762
Just try this fake smile, 
only on the bottom half of the face.

00:09:49.762 --> 00:09:52.273
You can even go, "Uh, uh."

00:09:52.411 --> 00:09:53.951
It doesn't feel so good, right?

00:09:53.951 --> 00:09:55.041
It feels inauthentic.

00:09:55.041 --> 00:09:56.851
Now, go all the way up into your eyes.

00:09:56.851 --> 00:09:59.431
So smile all the way up 
to the upper cheek muscles.

00:09:59.581 --> 00:10:01.736
Ah, that one should feel
so much better.

00:10:01.884 --> 00:10:04.474
What is interesting
about this facial expression

00:10:04.474 --> 00:10:06.734
is it causes our own happiness.

00:10:07.154 --> 00:10:09.873
And we also catch it when we see it.

00:10:09.893 --> 00:10:13.655
Researchers of the University of Finland
looked at these two facial expressions.

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:15.935
They had participants look at photos

00:10:15.935 --> 00:10:18.725
of people with the real happiness 
and fake happiness.

00:10:18.744 --> 00:10:20.921
They found that
when they showed participants

00:10:20.921 --> 00:10:23.311
pictures of the real happiness smile,

00:10:23.631 --> 00:10:25.311
those emotions caught -

00:10:25.311 --> 00:10:27.137
they caught the positive emotions,

00:10:27.137 --> 00:10:29.657
and they themselves
had a positive mood change.

00:10:29.983 --> 00:10:33.285
But when they looked at the face 
with the fake happiness smile,

00:10:33.288 --> 00:10:35.202
they caught nothing.

00:10:35.562 --> 00:10:38.917
In other words, if we show up to events
that we are ambivalent about,

00:10:39.339 --> 00:10:41.629
interact with people 
that we don't really like,

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.212
we become less memorable.

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:48.521
This doesn't just happen in person,
it also happens on the phone.

00:10:48.665 --> 00:10:50.708
So I worked with
a lot of different clients,

00:10:50.708 --> 00:10:53.131
corporate clients who are
on the phone all the time.

00:10:53.131 --> 00:10:54.223
They said "Vanessa,

00:10:54.223 --> 00:10:56.943
I get being happy in person,
but how about on the phone?"

00:10:56.943 --> 00:10:58.646
So we decided to do an experiment.

00:10:58.646 --> 00:11:03.466
We had participants in our lab
record different versions of their hello,

00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:05.465
the first impression on the phone.

00:11:05.546 --> 00:11:06.535
We wanted to know

00:11:06.535 --> 00:11:10.945
if people could hear
happiness, sadness or anger.

00:11:11.315 --> 00:11:14.132
So we had people record
different versions of their hello

00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:18.684
with happiness, sadness, anger
and while power posing.

00:11:18.684 --> 00:11:20.936
We wanted to see 
if they would sound different.

00:11:20.936 --> 00:11:23.731
So I wanna play you
two different versions of hello

00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:26.709
and see if you can guess
which one is the happy hello.

00:11:26.709 --> 00:11:27.913
Are you ready? Alright.

00:11:27.913 --> 00:11:29.483
Same person. Here is a).

00:11:30.395 --> 00:11:31.775
(Sound recording) Hello.

00:11:32.232 --> 00:11:33.212
Here is b).

00:11:33.707 --> 00:11:34.927
(Sound recording) Hello.

00:11:35.543 --> 00:11:37.662
How many people
think a) is the happy hello?

00:11:37.662 --> 00:11:39.545
How many think b) is the happy hello?

00:11:39.646 --> 00:11:40.672
Very good.

00:11:40.765 --> 00:11:43.277
We can hear this difference. 

00:11:43.281 --> 00:11:45.333
We can hear this microexpression.

00:11:45.333 --> 00:11:48.942
Now, I thought this was interesting,
but I wanted to take it a step further.

00:11:48.955 --> 00:11:51.087
So we devised a second part
of our experiment

00:11:51.091 --> 00:11:55.283
where we had participants in our lab
listen to these recordings

00:11:55.283 --> 00:11:57.947
and rate that person on likeability.

00:11:58.896 --> 00:12:00.010
We wanted to see

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.870
if the happiness microexpressions
or the anger microexpressions

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:05.065
or the power posing expression did better.

00:12:05.346 --> 00:12:06.372
Here's what happened.

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:08.023
After we asked people,

00:12:08.637 --> 00:12:10.639
"I do like this person a lot,"

00:12:10.902 --> 00:12:14.007
"I like this person a little,"
or "I do not like this person,"

00:12:14.176 --> 00:12:16.229
we found that the
happiness microexpressions

00:12:16.229 --> 00:12:18.699
across all trials for both men and women,

00:12:18.869 --> 00:12:20.959
they became more likeable.

00:12:21.327 --> 00:12:25.639
Whereas the same persons who baited
the anger or sadness microexpression

00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:27.119
were less likeable.

00:12:27.779 --> 00:12:32.302
This is the happy side effect 
of having your confidence be contagious.

00:12:32.531 --> 00:12:35.542
Not only do you infect someone else
with that happiness,

00:12:35.542 --> 00:12:37.992
you also become more likeable.

00:12:38.456 --> 00:12:39.791
We talked about non verbal,

00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:42.578
and I have to talk about
what comes after the hello.

00:12:42.671 --> 00:12:45.731
How do we infect confidence verbally?

00:12:46.394 --> 00:12:48.727
So in this study
we did in Portland, Oregon,

00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:51.437
we took 500 Speed-Networkers,

00:12:51.774 --> 00:12:53.817
and we asked each
of these Speed-Networkers

00:12:53.817 --> 00:12:56.297
to go through a
conversation starter round -

00:12:56.297 --> 00:12:57.597
eight of these rounds.

00:12:57.751 --> 00:12:59.983
So we assigned each participant 

00:12:59.983 --> 00:13:02.213
a conversation starter
to have with a stranger.

00:13:02.483 --> 00:13:05.629
Then we set up cameras
in all corners of the room,

00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:09.299
and we analyzed each
of these speed rounds for patterns.

00:13:09.461 --> 00:13:11.801
We were looking
for body language patterns:

00:13:11.931 --> 00:13:14.971
leans, nods, laughs, 
smiles, confidence.

00:13:15.033 --> 00:13:17.623
We were also looking 
for volume differences.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.870
In a really good conversation, 
usually the volume goes up.

00:13:20.874 --> 00:13:22.688
In a really awkward bad conversation,

00:13:22.688 --> 00:13:24.988
there are lots of silences,
the volume goes down.

00:13:25.186 --> 00:13:29.846
And we also asked each of the participants
to rate the conversation starters.

00:13:30.107 --> 00:13:34.406
We wanted to know which ones produced
the highest quality of conversation.

00:13:35.382 --> 00:13:39.069
What we found was that
the conversation starters that worked

00:13:39.455 --> 00:13:42.255
centered on this little chemical
called dopamine.

00:13:42.613 --> 00:13:46.641
So dopamine is the neurotransmitter 
that we produce when we feel pleasure

00:13:46.642 --> 00:13:48.542
or when we get a reward.

00:13:48.706 --> 00:13:50.991
And I noticed that most of our chit-chat

00:13:50.991 --> 00:13:53.821
that we have at parties
or networking events is the same.

00:13:53.857 --> 00:13:55.087
It sounds like this.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.890
"So, what do you do?"

00:13:59.197 --> 00:14:00.747
"Where are you from?"

00:14:01.195 --> 00:14:02.905
"Live around here? Huh?"

00:14:03.101 --> 00:14:05.116
"Well, I am going to go get
some more wine.

00:14:05.116 --> 00:14:06.631
It was great talking to you."

00:14:07.528 --> 00:14:10.578
Those conversations happened
over and over again.

00:14:10.662 --> 00:14:13.362
It was almost as if 
they were socially scripted.

00:14:13.826 --> 00:14:15.666
My brain was on autopilot.

00:14:15.742 --> 00:14:16.747
What we found was

00:14:16.747 --> 00:14:18.972
is that the worst ranked
conversation starters,

00:14:18.979 --> 00:14:20.939
the ones that got the lowest ratings,

00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:23.019
the ones that produced the lowest volume,

00:14:23.036 --> 00:14:27.786
the ones that got the most leans away, 
worst head nods, worst microexpressions,

00:14:28.074 --> 00:14:30.514
those were the ones that we use the most.

00:14:30.993 --> 00:14:32.795
"What do you do?"
"How are you?"

00:14:32.795 --> 00:14:34.095
"Where are you from?"

00:14:34.095 --> 00:14:37.345
from a physiological perspective, 
have no effect.

00:14:37.636 --> 00:14:38.766
No pleasure.

00:14:39.358 --> 00:14:42.117
So what we tried was to find
conversation starters

00:14:42.117 --> 00:14:45.711
that could spark or create
some kind of excitement.

00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:48.618
Can you verbally trigger dopamine?

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:51.296
We found that the brain
is really interesting.

00:14:51.614 --> 00:14:55.503
If you ask somebody a question,
it tends to look for hits and not misses.

00:14:55.693 --> 00:14:57.749
What I mean by this
is if you ask someone

00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:59.404
"Been busy lately?"

00:15:00.071 --> 00:15:03.027
their brain immediately looks 
for all the hits of "been busy."

00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:05.503
They think about negative things
that have happened -

00:15:05.503 --> 00:15:08.607
the stress, the busyness, 
all the bad things in their life.

00:15:08.767 --> 00:15:12.051
Whereas if you ask someone,
"Working on any exciting recently?"

00:15:12.727 --> 00:15:16.517
their brain immediately begins to look
for all the hits of "excitement."

00:15:16.965 --> 00:15:19.464
It starts to think about 
the good and happy things,

00:15:19.464 --> 00:15:21.974
all the excitement
that's going on in their own life.

00:15:21.974 --> 00:15:23.466
And that does two things.

00:15:23.466 --> 00:15:26.041
One, it creates pleasure for them.

00:15:26.436 --> 00:15:27.863
You are literally asking them

00:15:27.863 --> 00:15:30.684
to borrow excitement 
from other places in their life

00:15:30.684 --> 00:15:32.824
and bring it to the situation
that you're in.

00:15:33.202 --> 00:15:36.332
And the other thing that it does
is it makes you more memorable.

00:15:36.612 --> 00:15:39.025
Dr. John Medina found that dopamine,

00:15:39.025 --> 00:15:41.139
when it's triggered
in a verbal conversation,

00:15:41.139 --> 00:15:43.199
makes a mental post-it note.

00:15:43.645 --> 00:15:47.810
In other words, when you ask someone else
to think of what's exciting in their life,

00:15:47.976 --> 00:15:51.669
the happy side effect
is that you become more memorable.

00:15:52.177 --> 00:15:54.345
So here's my big challenge for today.

00:15:55.223 --> 00:15:58.093
Instead of using the typical

00:15:58.093 --> 00:15:59.195
"What do you do?"

00:15:59.195 --> 00:16:01.109
"How are you?" and "Where are you from?"

00:16:01.111 --> 00:16:04.114
let's banish those 
conversation starters forever,

00:16:04.114 --> 00:16:08.262
and let's try ones that ask the brain
to look for hits of excitement.

00:16:08.732 --> 00:16:11.922
Try "Working on anything
exciting these days?"

00:16:11.922 --> 00:16:13.718
"Have any vacations coming up?"

00:16:13.796 --> 00:16:15.802
"Anything good happen today?"

00:16:15.909 --> 00:16:20.612
I think this is the greatest gift
we can give our fellow human beings.

00:16:20.685 --> 00:16:23.825
We are asking them to flip into optimism.

00:16:24.121 --> 00:16:28.731
We are triggering dopamine and excitement
and getting them off autopilot.

00:16:29.662 --> 00:16:32.841
The last way that we
are contagious is emotionally.

00:16:33.234 --> 00:16:35.619
So, this study is one of my favorites.

00:16:35.901 --> 00:16:39.682
In this experiment, they asked
students to sing the song

00:16:39.702 --> 00:16:41.372
"Don't Stop Believing"

00:16:41.722 --> 00:16:43.505
into an accuracy software.

00:16:43.505 --> 00:16:45.509
Now, this a very nerve-racking experiment.

00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:48.538
They are rated on vocal tone, words,

00:16:48.538 --> 00:16:50.288
and they are given no preparation.

00:16:50.288 --> 00:16:52.871
But they did three different trials
of this experiment.

00:16:52.871 --> 00:16:55.204
First, they had them
just walk into the room

00:16:55.204 --> 00:16:57.144
and sing into an accuracy software.

00:16:57.174 --> 00:17:00.752
The second group got into the room
and had to say out loud,

00:17:01.052 --> 00:17:02.382
"I'm nervous."

00:17:02.572 --> 00:17:05.050
And the last group had to walk
into the room and say,

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:06.740
"I'm excited."

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.341
They found with this simple reframe

00:17:10.974 --> 00:17:13.665
the nervous group got 53% accuracy,

00:17:14.025 --> 00:17:15.918
the control group got 69%,

00:17:15.918 --> 00:17:20.486
but the "I'm excited" group 
got 80% accuracy.

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:22.086
Why?

00:17:22.086 --> 00:17:25.685
Anxiety and excitement 
are very similar emotions.

00:17:25.855 --> 00:17:28.005
The only difference is mindset.

00:17:28.966 --> 00:17:30.701
So my challenge for you today

00:17:30.703 --> 00:17:33.785
is to think about
how you want to infect people.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:37.638
When you want harness incitement
or trigger excitement:

00:17:37.638 --> 00:17:40.541
ask dopamine-worthy conversation starters;

00:17:40.541 --> 00:17:42.324
use more hand gestures;

00:17:42.324 --> 00:17:43.966
make authentic smiles;

00:17:43.966 --> 00:17:46.476
and never pick up the phone in a bad mood.

00:17:46.476 --> 00:17:47.903
(Laughter)

00:17:47.903 --> 00:17:51.382
And the last thing I want to do
is I want to end on a note of excitement.

00:17:51.382 --> 00:17:53.359
I want to make you really infectious.

00:17:53.359 --> 00:17:55.367
So what we are going to do
to end this talk

00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:58.279
is on the count of three,
with all the energy you can muster,

00:17:58.279 --> 00:18:01.169
I want you to yell out "I'm excited."

00:18:01.261 --> 00:18:02.321
Are you ready?

00:18:02.401 --> 00:18:03.990
One, two, three!

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.596
