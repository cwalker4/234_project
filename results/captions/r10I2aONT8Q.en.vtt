00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.566
- Every day, I end each show
with a reminder

00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.533
to be kind to one another,
and this next story

00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:07.300
is a perfect example of how
one small act of kindness

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.633
can go a very long way.

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:10.566
Come on down, Kelly McGuire.

00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.800
Your--really,
your story is great.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.233
So you live in Chicago,
and you were coming home

00:00:15.233 --> 00:00:16.600
from a Bears game, right?

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.633
- Yes.

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:18.866
- Okay, so tell everyone
what happened.

00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:21.766
- Okay, so I was coming home
from a Bears game,

00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.800
and we were trying
to hurry to our train,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.933
'cause I'm really last second.

00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:27.966
I always do that.
Grr, it's bad.

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.533
But we're hurrying, hurrying,
and I see a homeless woman,

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:33.266
and I passed her.

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:36.000
I crossed the street
and I stopped,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.466
and I grabbed my husband,
and I said,

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.533
"Listen, I'm about to do
something crazy.

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:43.433
I can't explain it, but I need
to give this woman my boots."

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:45.700
He's like, "Okay, crazy."
And so--

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.800
- It's cold outside.
- Yeah, it's freezing.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.766
She didn't want to talk
at first.

00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:52.033
I kind of had to make her feel
like I was a safe person,

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:55.266
and we began to connect
with one another,

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.033
and it was really special.

00:00:57.033 --> 00:00:59.566
And we only had
a few moments together.

00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:02.000
But I told her
I had seen her sign,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.466
once I got back
across the street,

00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:06.433
and it said that she needed
warm clothes,

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:08.166
and she needed some
winter boots.

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:10.400
And I could just see it in
her eyes, she was so thankful,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.833
and she started to cry
and I said,

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:13.233
"I want to give you
my boots too.

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:16.233
I'm just going to sit down
right next to you and--"

00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:17.366
So I took them off.
- And you both

00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:20.333
have the same size shoes.
- Yes, yeah.

00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:23.100
So I asked her, and I thought,
"This is real--"

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.233
I believe that--you know, like,
right place, right time timing,

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:29.033
and this was that moment, so--

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:31.466
I said, "You know, Amy,
I hope you have a great year.

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:34.533
I hope you stay warm and I hope
things turn around for you."

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:37.200
And she said,
"But what about your feet?

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.066
"You know, I don't want
your feet to be cold.

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.666
Can I give you my old boots?"

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:43.866
And it gives me the chills.

00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:45.700
Like, even just talking
about it right now,

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.833
I don't know how to not be
emotional about it,

00:01:47.833 --> 00:01:49.400
because that's
an emotional thing.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.333
- She--she gave me
her only thing.

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:53.833
- Yeah, she was now concerned
about you.

00:01:53.833 --> 00:01:56.200
She wasn't just taking the
boots, so she gave you hers.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.666
You put them on.

00:01:57.666 --> 00:02:01.166
But this is--this is not
the only act of kindness you--

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:03.100
Every Christmas Eve,
you drop off cookies

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.333
for the local fire department.

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:06.733
You drop off veggie trays to
nurses and doctors

00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:08.233
working in the ER.

00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:11.233
Valentine's Day, you drop off
cards and flowers to the widows

00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:12.766
of the church you go to.

00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:14.466
Your father's a teacher.
One of his students

00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:16.300
had to go to the ER.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.166
Parents couldn't go,
so you went to the ER

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:19.900
and held her hand
for three hours.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.633
During the holidays
and school year,

00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:24.566
you help organize donations
for 30 kids

00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:27.766
whose parents are incarcerated.

00:02:27.766 --> 00:02:30.266
You're really an incredible
young woman.

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:32.933
I mean, really,
I admire what you do.

00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:36.000
And I thought--
I wanted to give you my boots.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.533
You know I have a clothing line
and a lifestyle--

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:39.866
It's ED by Ellen, and so,

00:02:39.866 --> 00:02:42.800
I thought I would give you
my shoes.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.866
They're your size exactly.
We're the same size.

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:49.866
And I always keep my money in
it, so I have $10,000.

00:02:49.866 --> 00:02:54.600
[cheers and applause]

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.033
Now here's what I want.
[cheers and applause]

00:02:56.033 --> 00:02:58.366
- I've never had
that much money before.

00:02:58.366 --> 00:02:59.366
- All right.
[cheers and applause]

00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:01.800
[cheers and applause]

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.000
'Cause Shutterfly wants to help
you spread life's joy,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.300
and what we want,
with this $10,000,

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.166
I want you to find ten friends.
I want you to give them $1,000.

00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:12.766
I want you to tell them
to pay it forward,

00:03:12.766 --> 00:03:15.666
to find something to do
good with that.

00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:18.600
And then in my other shoe
is $10,000 for you.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.800
- Oh.
- All right?

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.533
[cheers and applause]

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:23.900
- Can I hug you?
[cheers and applause]

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.000
So special.
[cheers and applause]

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.466
[cheers and applause]

00:03:27.466 --> 00:03:28.566
- Thank you.
[cheers and applause]

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:30.600
All right.
So listen.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.133
[cheers and applause]

00:03:33.133 --> 00:03:35.033
This story--when I say
"be kind to one another,"

00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:36.466
I really mean it.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.833
I think we--I'm not just saying
it at the end of the show.

00:03:38.833 --> 00:03:41.466
I want everybody to start
a kindness campaign.

00:03:41.466 --> 00:03:43.266
I want to encourage
all my viewers

00:03:43.266 --> 00:03:44.833
to do simple acts
like Kelly did.

00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:46.366
If you see someone doing
something good,

00:03:46.366 --> 00:03:47.500
let us know about it.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.300
Post it on social media
and use the hashtag,

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.566
\#BeKindToOneAnother.

00:03:50.566 --> 00:03:51.766
It could be big,
it can be small.

00:03:51.766 --> 00:03:53.533
Doesn't matter,
as long as it's kind.

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:55.866
I really think we need this
out in the world right now.

00:03:55.866 --> 00:03:57.400
so please do that, everybody.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.433
We'll be right back.
