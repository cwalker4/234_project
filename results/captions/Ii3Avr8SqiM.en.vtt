00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:07.230
10 Horrifying Facts about the Roman Legions

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.440
10.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.849
Their Military Training

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.140
Around Rome’s beginnings, its army was only
comprised of local farmers, who would be hurriedly

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.810
called into action, fighting skirmishes with
neighboring settlements.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.660
All of this would change in 390 BC however,
when an army of Gauls utterly defeated the

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.919
Romans, and then descended upon the city itself.

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.859
They continued on sacking and pillaging Rome
for the next 6 months until finally they were

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.210
paid off to leave.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.840
The Romans got a wake-up call which would
change their destiny forever.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.810
They then spent the next following centuries
perfecting their Legions by systematically

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.880
training and organizing a professional military
machine like nobody had ever seen before.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.820
There were endless drills, and marches to
the point of exhaustion.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.920
Roman soldiers were attending weapons training
every morning and practiced melee combat with

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.950
wooden swords, spears and shields, twice as
heavy as their real counterparts.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.580
Part of their daily training also involved
a 19 mile-long march to be completed in five

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.260
hours, while carrying a full pack of weapons,
shield, food rations, cooking supplies and

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.470
a short spade, along with their own personal
kit.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.360
No other army in the world at the time would
receive such a rigorous training, which gave

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.330
the Roman Legions a tremendous advantage in
waging war.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.330
9.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.820
Discipline through fear

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.390
Following orders to the letter and not questioning
one’s superiors is something which most

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.000
don’t naturally have built into their consciousness.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.940
Severe punishments for even the slightest
of offenses, was something common within any

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.530
Roman Legion.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.890
Soldiers would often times be stoned to death
by their comrades for cowardice in battle

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.190
or even for falling asleep at their posts
while on sentry duty.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.810
Minor offenses were handled by the Centurions
(military officers), who always carried vine

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.710
branches in order to strike at their legionnaires.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.680
And since these officers were held directly
responsible for the behavior of the men serving

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.390
under them, whippings were commonplace in
a Roman military camp.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.420
This ruthless treatment nevertheless proved
useful time and time again, as the men became

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.420
more reliant and trusting of each other for
their very survival in the extremely harsh

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.229
conditions they endured at the fringes of
the empire.

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.639
In short, this discipline instilled through
fear gave Roman soldiers a far better chance

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:16.090
at survival if they blindly obeyed their superiors,
than if they did not.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.090
8.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.420
The Decimation

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.909
One particularly brutal punishment for any
Legion was the Decimation, and was as bad

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:23.909
as it actually sounds.

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:28.180
The word itself comes from this Roman military
disciplinary measure, used on large groups

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.499
of soldiers guilty of capital offenses like
mutiny, treason or desertion.

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:36.999
Decimation is derived from Latin meaning "removal
of a tenth".

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:40.749
The way they went about it was to have the
guilty men divided into groups of ten, and

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:42.209
to have them draw straws.

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.109
The soldier who drew the short straw was to
be killed by the other nine, by clubbing him

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:47.239
to death.

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.499
And since the decision of who will die was
left to chance, all soldiers were liable for

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:55.099
execution, regardless of their level of involvement,
rank or distinction.

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.809
But because killing off ten percent of the
army is almost never a good idea, the Decimation

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:02.529
never became common practice.

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:03.529
7.

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:04.529
Weapons and Armor

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:08.310
As Rome expanded its borders, the army become
more standardized, with the equipment being

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.829
provided by the state.

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.480
Their first line of defense was the chainmail
shirt.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.810
The main advantages of the chainmail were
its light weight and that it offered good

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.349
protection against slashing swords.

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.659
During the 1st century AD however, the chainmail
was partially replaced by segmented plate

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:23.659
armor.

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.519
Though heavier and with a higher maintenance,
plate armor offered a great deal more protection

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.290
against piercing attacks.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.269
The Roman helmet was redesigned and improved
over the centuries.

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.459
It was fashioned in such a way as to offer
maximum protection, but without blocking the

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:37.459
senses.

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.699
It had large cheek pieces as to protect the
side of the face, but not to cover the ears,

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:45.080
so the soldiers could hear the commands given
by the Centurions.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.389
The crests, often times made out of horsehair
or sometimes feathers, had the purpose of

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:54.299
making the wearer appear larger and fiercer,
as well as to distinguish between the ranks.

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.510
Further protection came from the Roman shield.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.419
It was made of layers of wood glued together
and covered with leather and metal.

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:04.089
The shield was also curved, thus offering
more protection to the sides.

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:08.040
Due to its size, the shield was also used
as an offensive weapon, and worked perfectly

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.809
in combination with the Roman short sword.

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:11.809
6.

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:13.510
Battle Tactics and Formations

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.030
But what truly made the Roman Legions the
best fighting force throughout the ancient

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.861
world, were the structured nature of the army,
and the formations they used in battle.

00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:28.759
A Legion was comprised of 4,800 men, divided
into 10 Cohorts of 480, which in turn contained

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:32.509
6 Centuries of 80 soldiers, each commanded
by a Centurion.

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:37.550
This highly structured form offered the army
both unity among the ranks, as well as a great

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.090
deal of coordination on the battlefield.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.960
Most of the barbarians the Romans were in
conflict with fought in loose arrangements

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.580
and each warrior sought individual glory.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.479
But every one of the 4,800 soldiers in a Roman
Legion had a precise role to play in a master

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:53.479
strategy.

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:57.480
A typical assault would begin at long range,
using catapults which shower the enemies with

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.620
boulders and iron bolts.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.550
Next the legionaries would launch their javelins.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.120
Made of a wooden handle and a long iron head,
the Pilum, as it was called by the Romans,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.389
would bend on impact, preventing the enemy
from throwing it back.

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.509
Then the soldiers would stand shoulder to
shoulder, swords out, and began their advance

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:16.210
as a moving wall of death and destruction.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.789
With the shield extending from their chins
almost down to their ankles, there wasn’t

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:22.659
much a group of disorganized tribesmen could
do.

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:23.659
5.

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:25.370
Sea Battles Fought on “Land”

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.169
A shortage of skilled Roman soldiers came
in the form of sea warfare.

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.910
As Rome took control of most of the Italian
Peninsula, they turned their attention out

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.080
to sea.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.759
Here they met the Carthaginians and in 264
BC the First Punic War had begun.

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:43.759
This 23-year-long conflict between the two
Mediterranean super powers was fought over

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:48.110
control of the strategically-important islands
of Sicily and Corsica.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.770
While Carthage boasted a sizable military
fleet, Rome did not.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.500
Nevertheless, the Romans quickly countered
that disadvantage by building their own navy

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.300
following a design stolen from the Carthaginians
themselves.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.300
Still lacking any real seafaring experience,
and while waiting for the ships to be built,

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.639
the Legionnaires began practicing rowing in
unison while still on dry land.

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:11.700
Since they were expert melee fighters, they
came up with an ingenious invention to turn

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.509
sea battles into land battles.

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:18.659
This secret weapon came in the form of the
Corvus, a boarding bridge 4 ft. wide and 36

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:21.030
ft. long, which could be raised or lowered
at will.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.879
It had small railings on both sides and a
metal prong on its backside which would pierce

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:28.139
the deck of the Carthaginian ship and secure
it in place.

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.620
With it the Romans were able to defeat their
enemy and win the war.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.620
4.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.620
Bellum Gallicum

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.509
The Gallic Wars, or Bellum Gallicum, were
a series of military campaigns waged by the

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:42.719
Roman Legions under Julius Caesar against
the Gauls living in present-day France, Belgium

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:43.990
and parts of Switzerland.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:50.389
These wars lasted from 58 BC to 52 BC and
culminated with a definite Roman victory and

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:53.580
expansion of the Roman Republic over the whole
of Gaul.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.120
But these wars weren’t waged for the glory
of Rome per se, but rather for the political

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.980
ambitions of Caesar himself.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.210
He recruited and paid his own Legions, which
made the soldiers highly devoted to him, and

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.480
him alone.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.729
Even though the region was home to somewhere
around 15 to 20 million people, his successes

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:12.789
were in large part due to the fact that the
Gauls was a conglomeration of loose tribal

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:15.979
armies that lacked any real discipline and
cohesion.

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:20.160
This way Caesar had to fight each band of
warriors as he encountered them, and the campaign

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.919
stretched on for much longer than he initially
anticipated.

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:28.169
Vercingetorix, "Victor of a Hundred Battles",
managed to finally rally the tribes against

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:30.680
the Roman Legions, but it was too little too
late.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:36.290
At the battle of Alesia in 52 BC, Vercingetorix
almost prevailed against Caesar, but ultimately

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.430
lost the battle.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:42.699
By the time the Roman conquest of Gaul had
ended, over one million Celts lay dead, and

00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:44.880
another 500,000 were sent into slavery.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.120
3.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.120
Crucifixions

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.220
The Romans were notorious for the ways in
which they treated and disposed of anyone

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.139
who would stand in their way against total
domination.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:56.860
One particular way they dealt with the people
they thought threatened the Roman way of life,

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.310
was by crucifixion.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:02.340
This particularly brutal form of punishment
was often used as a means of torture, as well

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.759
as to send a message.

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:07.970
Those people who were crucified were often
times accused of sedition, or conspiracy to

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:08.970
rebellion.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:13.270
Jesus was crucified for the exact same reason,
and not for his religious teachings.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.849
The two men besides him were also considered
insurgents, not thieves.

00:08:16.849 --> 00:08:21.169
Though not the inventors of this horrific
practice, the Romans did excel in it.

00:08:21.169 --> 00:08:26.020
During Spartacus’ rebellion in 72 BC, 6,000
captured rebels were crucified.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:31.199
Since Rome’s population was about 40% slaves,
and Spartacus and the other rebels were slaves

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:35.980
themselves, their crucifixion was a definite
message to those still living: “Do not stir

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.880
dissent or this will be your end too.”

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.880
2.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.400
The Praetorian Guard

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.590
The most powerful of all the Roman Legions
was the Praetorian Guard which was stationed

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.000
in Rome itself.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.420
And often times, the Praetorians had the power
of life and death over the Emperors themselves.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.930
They came into being as elite soldiers protecting
generals during the Roman Republic.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:59.690
But the Praetorian Guard in itself didn’t
officially appear until Augustus became Rome’s

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:01.940
first emperor in 27 BC.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.410
They acted as bodyguards to the Emperor, emergency
firefighters, the secret police, as crowd

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:10.600
control, and even fought in the arena to show
off their prowess to the masses.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.630
But as Rome’s power grew, so did its corruption
and intrigue.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:17.540
And the Praetorian Guard was often times right
in the middle of all of it.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:21.930
Even though their task was to ensure the interests
of the Emperor, if those interests didn’t

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.090
coincide with their own, they would just replace
him.

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:29.770
Disgruntled Praetorians famously engineered
the assassination of Caligula in 41 AD.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.660
Many other emperors were killed by the Praetorians.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.570
In 193 AD, they even put the crown up for
auction.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.620
One man, Didius Julianus won by promising
them each a bribe of 5-years-pay.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.130
But since he couldn’t deliver, he too was
murdered 66 days later.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:49.410
In 306 AD, the Praetorians tried to play the
role of kingmaker one last time by supporting

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.160
Maxentius as the western emperor in Rome.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.220
They were defeated by Constantine at the Battle
of Milvian Bridge in 312, and he then disbanded

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.380
the Guard.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.380
1.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.040
Making and Breaking the Empire

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.390
Without a doubt, the Roman Empire in all its
might was made by the many Legions who fought

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:06.570
and killed for it.

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.600
But in the end, the army is what brought Rome
down.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.870
As we’ve seen up until now, Rome was a highly
militarized society with an army of about

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.050
130,000 soldiers.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:17.880
One man in eight was in the army.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:22.010
And while in the beginning only men with property
were allowed to fight for the glory of Rome,

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:27.000
once it expanded beyond the Italian Peninsula,
the ranks were open to a great deal more people.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.960
Foreigners were employed as Auxiliaries, and
after 25 years of fighting, they would be

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.680
granted citizenship.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.950
Since these men were not citizens of Rome,
they didn’t believe in the idea of Rome

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.870
and the “civilization” it brought with
it; most never even seeing the city itself.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:44.260
Now, many soldiers had less interest in defending
it, and instead making their fortune through

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.710
the spoils of war.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:49.120
Their loyalty was no longer to the city or
the Empire, but to the generals who they were

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.460
serving under; like was the case with Caesar
and his Legions.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.060
Army generals then realized they could become
Emperor just by marching into Rome, which

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.270
they often did.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:04.000
By 395 AD, the Empire would be divided into
the east and west and by 476 only its eastern

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.550
part would survive.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:10.420
The Eastern Roman Empire would rule from Constantinople
and be a dominant force in the region for

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:29.420
the following 1,200 years.
