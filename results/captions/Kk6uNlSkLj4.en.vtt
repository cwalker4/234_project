00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.468
WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW."

00:00:01.468 --> 00:00:08.408
I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:09.142 size:84% position:42%
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:14.214
I NEED THAT TONIGHT IN WAYS I
DON'T ALWAYS NEED IT BECAUSE

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:20.587
TODAY HAS SHAKEN ME TO MY CORE,
AND I DON'T THINK I NEED TO

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:24.591
POINT OUT THAT, AT 54, THERE'S
NOT A LOT OF CORE LEFT.

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:25.825 size:78% position:39%
IT'S A NICE SUIT.

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:29.062 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT GIVES ME THE ILLUSION OF
CORE.

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:34.601
( LAUGHTER )
BEFORE WE GET INTO WHETHER OUR

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:35.735
PRESIDENT IS THE SIBERIAN
CANDIDATE, I'D LIKE TO REMIND

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:37.070
YOU OF SOMETHING LINCOLN SAID,
"AMERICA WILL NEVER BE DESTROYED

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.305 size:78% position:39%
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:41.174
IF WE FALTER AND LOSE OUR
FREEDOMS, IT WILL BE BECAUSE WE

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:46.413
DESTROYED OURSELVES."

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:49.082
AND, "A HOUSE DIVIDED AGAINST
ITSELF CANNOT STAND."

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:53.686
THEY WERE TWO OF HIS MOST FAMOUS
TWEETS.

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:59.993 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
SO, WITH THAT IN MIND, I'M

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:03.463
THINKING THAT
MAYBE THE MOST PATRIOTIC THING

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:07.567
WE CAN DO RIGHT NOW, IS NOT
POINT OUT THE ALARMING BEHAVIOR

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:08.802
OF OUR PRESIDENT, WHICH COULD BE
DIVISIVE.

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:14.507
BUT INSTEAD, JUST TAKE IT UNTIL
HE'S GONE.

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:15.408
( LAUGHTER )
DOES ANYBODY FEEL LIKE TAKING

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:18.678 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT?

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:20.580 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: NO!

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.485
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ME NEITHER.

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:30.890
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I WAS WORRIED THERE FOR JUST A

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.360 align:start size:88% position:13%
SECOND.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:41.534
SO TRUMP'S IN HELSINKI WITH HIS
BUDDY VLAD, AND THIS MEETING IS

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:44.437
JUST THREE DAYS AFTER
12 RUSSIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:45.805
AGENTS UNDER DIRECT KREMLIN
CONTROL WERE INDICTED FOR

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:47.740
HACKING THE 2016 ELECTION.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.175 size:88% position:56%
12 AGENTS SOUNDS LIKE A LOT.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:50.977
BUT, REMEMBER, THEY'RE RUSSIAN,
SO THEY WERE ALL NESTED INSIDE

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:54.380 align:start size:88% position:13%
ONE BIG AGENT.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.783 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
OKAY?

00:01:56.783 --> 00:02:01.521 align:start size:88% position:13%
( APPLAUSE )
( PIANO RIFF )

00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:03.690
FIRST, THE TWO MEN HAD A PRIVATE
MEETING WITH ONLY TRANSLATORS IN

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.993 align:start size:88% position:13%
THE ROOM.

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:08.828
AND TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE STAYED
OUT, THEY PUT THIS SIGN ON THE

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:09.529
DOOR: "STRONGMEN ONLY!

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:12.432 size:81% position:41%
NO GIRLS ALLOWED."

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:17.103 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
BEFORE WE GET INTO THE NITTY

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:20.206
CRAZY OF WHAT THEY SAID DURING
THEIR POST-MEETING PRESS

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:23.643
CONFERENCE, LET'S SEE HOW PEOPLE
REACTED TO TRUMP'S PERFORMANCE,

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.612
BECAUSE THE REVIEWS ARE IN:
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:28.081
PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST
DISGRACEFUL OF PERFORMANCES BY

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:31.151 size:88% position:56%
AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT AT A
SUMMIT IN FRONT OF A RUSSIAN

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:37.257
LEADER CERTAINLY THAT I'VE EVER
SEEN.

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:38.725
&gt;&gt; WE HEARD THE WORST THAT WE
COULD POSSIBLY HEAR FROM A U.S.

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:40.760
PRESIDENT WHILE STANDING
ALONGSIDE VLADIMIR PUTIN.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.562 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; YOU SHOULD CALL THIS THE
SURRENDER SUMMIT.

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:44.998
&gt;&gt; THIS WAS A WORST-CASE
SCENARIO GOING INTO THIS.

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.099 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; DISGUSTING.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.334
AND THAT'S WHAT MADE HIS
PERFORMANCE DISGUSTING.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:49.969
I'M SORRY, IT'S THE ONLY WAY I
FEEL.

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:50.737
NOT A RIGHT OR LEFT THING TO ME.

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:51.704 size:75% position:38%
IT'S JUST WRONG.

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:53.840 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: WOW.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.078
THOSE ARE THE WORST REVIEWS I'VE
SEEN SINCE TITANIC.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:01.347 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
AND I DON'T MEAN THE MOVIE.

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:02.048 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
"ONE STAR.

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:02.582 align:start size:88% position:13%
I DROWNED.

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:05.385 size:84% position:42%
GREAT BAND THOUGH."

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:06.719 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:07.987 size:75% position:38%
THAT'S POSITIVE.

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:09.289
THAT'S KIND OF POSITIVE.

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.758
&gt;&gt; THAT'S KIND OF POSITIVE.

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:14.527 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU DON'T HEAR
ABOUT THAT PART.

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:16.296 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHY SO BAD?

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:21.100
WELL, HE ASKED ABOUT RUSSIA
MEDDLING WITH OUR ELECTION AND

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.104
WHETHER HE BELIEVED ALL OF OUR
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, OR PUTIN?

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:27.140
&gt;&gt; MY PEOPLE CAME TO ME.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.808
DAN COATS CAME TO ME AND SOME
OTHERS SAID THEY THINK IT'S

00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:31.277 align:start size:88% position:13%
RUSSIA.

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:36.649
I HAVE PRESIDENT PUTIN, HE JUST
SAID IT'S NOT RUSSIA.

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:43.456
I WILL SAY THIS, I DON'T SEE ANY
REASON WHY IT WOULD BE.

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:50.863
( AUDIENCE REACTS )
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: YOU DON'T SEE ANY

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:51.965 align:start size:88% position:13%
REASON?

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:53.199 size:88% position:44%
DO YOU OWN A MIRROR?

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.069
BECAUSE AFTER THROWING YOUR
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY UNDER THE

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.707
BUS, YOU THREW IT IN REVERSE AND
TURNED THEM INTO ROAD BURGER.

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:05.211
&gt;&gt; I HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN MY
INTELLIGENCE PEOPLE, BUT I WILL

00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:10.383
TELL YOU THAT PRESIDENT PUTIN
WAS EXTREMELY STRONG AND

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:14.387
POWERFUL IN HIS DENIAL TODAY.

00:04:14.387 --> 00:04:16.923 align:start size:88% position:13%
( AUDIENCE REACTS )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NO, NO, NO, BOO

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:23.263 align:start size:88% position:13%
ALL YOU WANT, BUT
"HE'S EXTREMELY STRONG AND

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:24.230 align:start size:88% position:13%
POWERFUL.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.698
HE DOES NOT SKIP LEG DAY, AND I
KNOW BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I AM

00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:30.203
SMOOCHING HIS GLUTES."

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:38.311 align:start size:88% position:13%
( PIANO RIFF )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:39.946
WHAT IT IS GOING TO TAKE FOR YOU
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PUTIN

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:45.285
DIRECTED HIS OFFICIALS TO HELP
YOU GET ELECTED?

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:46.352
DOES HE HAVE TO COME OUT AND SAY
IT?

00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:47.387 align:start size:88% position:13%
BECAUSE HE DID.

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:50.089
&gt;&gt; PRESIDENT PUTIN, DID YOU WANT
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO WIN THE

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:51.424
ELECTION AND DID YOU DIRECT ANY
OF YOUR OFFICIALS TO HELP HIM DO

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:52.425 align:start size:88% position:13%
THAT?

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:55.295 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; YES, I DID.

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:58.731 align:start size:88% position:13%
YES, I DID.

00:04:58.731 --> 00:05:01.601
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: YES, HE DID.

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:03.202
THAT IS SHOCKING, MOSTLY BECAUSE
I'M NOT USED TO A PRESIDENT

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:06.039 size:81% position:41%
TELLING THE TRUTH.

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.574
ONE REPORTER GAVE TRUMP A CHANCE
TO HOLD PUTIN'S FEET TO THE

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:10.877 align:start size:88% position:13%
FIRE.

00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:14.480
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU NOW, WITH THE WHOLE
WORLD WATCHING, TELL PRESIDENT

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.983
PUTIN, WOULD YOU DENOUNCE WHAT
HAPPENED IN 2016 AND WOULD YOU

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.785
WARN HIM TO NEVER DO IT AGAIN?

00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:22.722
&gt;&gt; SO LET ME JUST SAY THAT WE
HAVE TWO THOUGHTS YOU HAVE

00:05:22.722 --> 00:05:24.624
GROUPS THAT ARE WONDERING WHY
THE F.B.I. NEVER TOOK THE

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:25.792 align:start size:88% position:13%
SERVER?

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:27.427 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHY HAVEN'T THEY TAKEN THE
SERVER?

00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:28.761
WHERE ARE THOSE SERVERS?

00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:32.465
I WANT TO KNOW WHERE IS THE
SERVER AND WHAT IS THE SERVER

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:33.933 align:start size:88% position:13%
SAYING?

00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:36.202 size:88% position:44%
WHERE IS THE SERVER?

00:05:36.202 --> 00:05:38.638
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: WE KNOW WHERE THE
SERVER IS.

00:05:38.638 --> 00:05:44.110
HE'S STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO THE
MASTER.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:56.356
( APPLAUSE )
THEY HAVE A SAFE WORD, PUMPKIN

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:56.556 align:start size:88% position:13%
PATCH.

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:57.790
AND THE PRESIDENT REMINDED US
WHO'S REALLY TO BLAME FOR RUSSIA

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.692
ATTACKING OUR COUNTRY:
&gt;&gt; I HOLD BOTH COUNTRIES

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:01.294 align:start size:88% position:13%
RESPONSIBLE.

00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:03.062
I THINK THE UNITED STATES HAS
BEEN FOOLISH.

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:04.864 align:start size:88% position:13%
I THINK WE HAVE ALL BEEN
FOOLISH.

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:06.332
I THINK THAT WE'RE ALL TO BLAME.

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:08.401
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: YEAH, WE'RE ALL TO
BLAME.

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:09.402
TRUMP SOUNDS JUST LIKE F.D.R.

00:06:09.402 --> 00:06:12.739 size:84% position:42%
AFTER PEARL HARBOR.

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:19.212
YESTERDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1941: A
DATE FOR WHICH BOTH COUNTRIES

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:20.947 align:start size:88% position:13%
ARE TO BLAME.

00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:24.450
I MEAN, IF WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE
ATTACKED, WHY DID WE HAVE THOSE

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:29.922 align:start size:88% position:13%
SEXY BATTLESHIPS IN OUR BIG
JUICY HARBOR?

00:06:29.922 --> 00:06:31.858 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YES.

00:06:31.858 --> 00:06:34.093
PEOPLE DON'T USUALLY PLAY THAT
MUCH OF IT.

00:06:34.093 --> 00:06:36.429
THEY USUALLY CUT IT OFF EARLIER
THAN THAT.

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:39.632
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, I NEVER HEARD THAT
PART BEFORE.

00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:41.734 align:start size:88% position:13%
( APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IF TRUMP'S

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:46.572 align:start size:88% position:13%
SPINELESS TOADYING TO
PUTIN MADE YOU THINK, WHAT'S

00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:46.939 size:75% position:38%
VLAD GOT ON HIM?

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:47.507
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE.

00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:48.741
&gt;&gt; DOES THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT
HAVE ANY COMPROMISING MATERIAL

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:49.909 align:start size:88% position:13%
ON PRESIDENT TRUMP OR HIS
FAMILY?

00:06:49.909 --> 00:07:00.620 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; (LAUGHS)
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: ( LAUGHS )

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.321
"I'M SORRY, I WAS JUST
REMEMBERING FUNNY VIDEO I SAW OF

00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:06.325 align:start size:88% position:13%
MR. TRUMP.

00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:15.034
I DON'T WANT TO SAY WHAT IT WAS,
BUT IT WAS PEE-PEE TAPE."

00:07:15.034 --> 00:07:16.569 align:start size:88% position:13%
( PIANO RIFF )
( APPLAUSE )

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:20.506
NEXT QUESTION, WHO WANTS TO DIE
NEXT?

00:07:20.506 --> 00:07:21.707
BUT PUTIN DOES KNOW EXACTLY
WHERE AND WHEN HE DIDN'T GET THE

00:07:21.707 --> 00:07:24.911 align:start size:88% position:13%
MATERIAL HE FOR-SURE DOESN'T
HAVE.

00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:29.649
&gt;&gt; I TREATED PRESIDENT TRUMP
WITH UTMOST RESPECT, BUT BACK

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:36.055
THEN, WHEN HE WAS A PRIVATE
INDIVIDUAL, A BUSINESSMAN,

00:07:36.055 --> 00:07:40.426 align:start size:88% position:13%
NOBODY INFORMED ME HE WAS IN
MOSCOW.

00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:42.128
LET'S TAKE ST. PETERSBURG
ECONOMIC FORUM, FOR INSTANCE.

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:44.397
THERE WERE 500 AMERICAN BUSINESS
MEN, THE HIGH-RANKING LEVEL ONES

00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:45.832
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THE LAST
NAMES OF EACH AND EVERY ONE OF

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:47.567 align:start size:88% position:13%
THEM.

00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:50.303
DO YOU REMEM- DO YOU THINK WE
TRIED TO COLLECT COMPROMISING

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:55.174 align:start size:88% position:13%
MATERIAL ON EACH AND EVERY
SINGLE ONE OF THEM?

00:07:55.174 --> 00:07:56.742
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: YES, I DO.

00:07:56.742 --> 00:08:00.746
WHEN I WAS IN RUSSIA, I WAS
FOLLOWED EVERYWHERE I WENT, AND

00:08:00.746 --> 00:08:03.683 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'M A COMEDIAN.

00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:05.818 align:start size:88% position:13%
ALL RIGHT?

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:06.719
( LAUGHTER )
I WAS INFORMED IN NO UNCERTAIN

00:08:06.719 --> 00:08:10.990
TERMS THAT MY PHONE WAS BUGGED
AND MY ROOM HAD CAMERAS IN IT.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.793 size:88% position:56%
I SHOWERED IN A BLUE BLAZER.

00:08:13.793 --> 00:08:20.466
( LAUGHTER )
WHEN I FINALLY HAD TO GET NAKED,

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:24.804 align:start size:88% position:13%
I TURNED TO EVERY MIRROR AND
SAID, "YOU LIKE, IVAN?

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:30.610 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU LIKE?

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:41.621 align:start size:88% position:13%
HUH?"
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:45.625
( PIANO RIFF )
"HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, BABY.

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:51.831 align:start size:88% position:13%
AMERICA."

00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:53.633
"AMERICA NUMBER ONE."

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:55.768 align:start size:88% position:13%
AND PUTIN HAD A VERY STRANGE
IDEA FOR ROBERT MUELLER.

00:08:55.768 --> 00:08:58.237
&gt;&gt; WE CAN ACTUALLY PERMIT
OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVES OF THE

00:08:58.237 --> 00:09:04.410
UNITED STATES INCLUDING THE
MEMBERS OF THIS VERY COMMISSION

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:10.516
HEADED BY MR. MUELLER, WE CAN
LET THEM INTO THE COUNTRY.

00:09:10.516 --> 00:09:11.384 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: "COME TO MOSCOW,
MR. MUELLER.

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.119
AS OUR GUEST, WE WILL 'TAKE YOU
OUT,' IF YOU GET MY DRIFT.

00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:14.820
WE WILL ROLL OUT THE RED CARPET,
WHICH IS RED FROM BLOOD-- IF YOU

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.188
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.

00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:18.491
I'M SAYING, WE WILL KILL YOU."

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:21.294
BUT PERHAPS THE WEIRDEST MOMENT
OF THE WHOLE WEIRD-FEST WAS WHEN

00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:23.095
PUTIN GAVE TRUMP A LITTLE
PRESENT TO COMMEMORATE THE WORLD

00:09:23.095 --> 00:09:25.464 align:start size:88% position:13%
CUP.

00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:28.100
&gt;&gt; MR. PRESIDENT, I GIVE THIS
BALL TO YOU, AND NOW THE BALL IS

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.238 align:start size:88% position:13%
IN YOUR COURT.

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.306
( AUDIENCE REACTS )
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: NICE GIFT, ALTHOUGH

00:09:33.306 --> 00:09:36.108
I THINK PUTIN STILL HAS A SET OF
TRUMP'S BALLS.

00:09:36.108 --> 00:09:37.510 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH!

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.712 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: TRUMP'S SHOCKING
PERFORMANCE IN THIS SHOCKING

00:09:39.712 --> 00:09:41.013 align:start size:88% position:13%
PRESS CONFERENCE
SHOCKED A SHOCKING NUMBER OF

00:09:41.013 --> 00:09:44.650
PEOPLE AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THEM
WHEN WE COME BACK.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:45.318 align:start size:88% position:13%
STICK AROUND.
