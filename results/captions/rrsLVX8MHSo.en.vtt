00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:07.503
&gt;&gt; "CONVERSATION WITH THE
CANDIDATE" CONTINUES.

00:00:07.503 --> 00:00:14.680
ADAM: THANK YOU FOR CLICKING ON
OUR EXTENDED DIGITAL
"CONVERSATION WITH THE
CANDIDATE" WITH ENTREPRENEUR,
ANDREW YANG.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:23.362
WE HAVE 30 MINUTES
COMMERCIAL-FREE, SO WE CAN GET
TO AS MANY QUESTIONS AS
POSSIBLE.

00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:29.501
&gt;&gt; MY DAD AND MY FAMILY GREW UP
AS KENNEDY DEMOCRATS.

00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:33.966
NOWADAYS, WE WONDER, WHERE HAVE
THE DEMOCRATS GONE?

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:40.639
NOW, ALL YOU SEE IS A BUNCH OF
SOCIALISTS HAVE INFILTRATED
THEM.

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:43.909
WHERE ARE THE DEMOCRATS WORKING
FOR AMERICA?

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:49.048
MR. YANG: I WAS IN IOWA WITH A
TRUCKER NAMED DENNIS.

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:52.171
HE ASKED ME A SIMILAR QUESTION.

00:00:52.171 --> 00:01:01.330
WHY IS IT THAT THE DEMOCRATS
DON’T SEEM TO BE WHAT THE
WORKING CLASS -- WITH THE
WORKING CLASS?

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.135
I GOT THE SAME PERCEPTION FROM
UNION WORKERS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.

00:01:05.135 --> 00:01:10.669
TO ME, THE DEMOCRATS NEED TO
HAVE THE BACKS OF THE WORKING
PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY.

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:13.506
THAT WILL BE TRANSFORMATIVE FOR
THE PARTY.

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:17.651
THE FACT THAT THAT HAS CHANGED
IS THE MISSING PIECE.

00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:23.519
WE NEED TO TAKE THAT BACK SO
THAT YOU FEEL LIKE THE DEMOCRATS
HAVE YOUR BACK.

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:28.258
ADAM: WHY DO YOU THINK THAT HAS
CHANGED OVER THE LAST FEW
DECADES?

00:01:28.258 --> 00:01:33.726
MR. YANG: THERE’S BEEN THIS
MOVEMENT IN THE PARTY TO BECOME
THIS MORE URBAN PARTY.

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:41.500
THE URBAN PARTY HAS ADOPTED
VARIOUS CULTURAL ISSUES AS
OPPOSED TO ECONOMIC AND
BREAD-AND-BUTTER ISSUES.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.656
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS BECOME
TOO TRUSTING OF INSTITUTIONS BUT
NOT TRUSTING ENOUGH OF PEOPLE.

00:01:48.656 --> 00:01:58.856
IF YOU WERE TO TALK TO DEMOCRAT
ABOUT HOW TO FIX SCHOOLS, IT
WOULD BE LIKE, INVEST IN
TECHNOLOGY FOR THE SCHOOLS.

00:01:58.856 --> 00:02:03.491
THE BEST THING YOU COULD DO IS
PAY THE TEACHERS MORE.

00:02:03.491 --> 00:02:08.127
THE DEMOCRATIC SOLUTIONS HAVE
BEEN LESS AND LESS COMPELLING TO
PEOPLE.

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:11.997
PEOPLE HAVE LOST CONFIDENCE IN
THIS ARRAY OF PROGRAMS.

00:02:11.997 --> 00:02:16.268
THE DEMOCRATIC SOLUTION IS
CREATE A NEW PROGRAM.

00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:22.741
WE JUST NEED TO GET RESOURCES
INTO THE HANDS OF PARENTS AND
FAMILIES AND TEACHERS AND
SCHOOLS.

00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:26.531
THAT WILL BE A BETTER APPROACH.

00:02:26.531 --> 00:02:31.885
ADAM: IS UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME
SOCIALISM BY OTHER MEANS?

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:35.047
MR. YANG: IT’S VERY MUCH NOT.

00:02:35.047 --> 00:02:38.990
IT IS CAPITALISM WHERE INCOME
DOESN’T START AT ZERO.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.495
WE ARE UP TO $20 TRILLION IN
GDP.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:45.341
WHERE THE RICHEST AND MOST
ADVANCED ECONOMY.

00:02:45.341 --> 00:02:49.001
MOST PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY ARE
NOT EXPERIENCING THAT.

00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:54.240
78% OF AMERICANS ARE LIVING
PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.262
MOST AMERICANS CAN’T AFFORD AN
UNEXPECTED $500 BILL.

00:03:00.262 --> 00:03:05.751
I’VE BEEN WHERE THE BOUNTY IS
BEING CONCENTRATED.

00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:13.434
THERE’S SO MUCH VALUE BEING
CREATED THAT WE CAN EASILY DO
THIS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

00:03:13.434 --> 00:03:16.795
IT WOULD BUILD A TRICKLE UP
ECONOMY.

00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:20.484
THAT’S WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
NEEDS.

00:03:20.484 --> 00:03:28.315
&gt;&gt; A LOT OF THE CONVERSATION HAS
BEEN ABOUT HOW TECHNOLOGY IS
CHANGING THE WORKFORCE.

00:03:28.315 --> 00:03:34.580
HOW DO YOU PLAN TO PREPARE
AMERICANS FOR THE FUTURE
WORKFORCE NEEDS?

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.552
MR. YANG: RIGHT NOW, WE ARE
OVERPRESCRIBING COLLEGE.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:45.074
THE MISSING PIECE IS TECHNICAL
APPRENTICESHIP FOR HIGH SCHOOL
UP.

00:03:45.074 --> 00:03:50.596
ONLY 6% OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
ARE IN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS.

00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:56.902
THAT REFLECT MILLIONS OF
UNFILLED JOBS THAT WILL BE
RESISTANT TO AUTOMATION.

00:03:56.902 --> 00:04:01.207
IT’S HARD TO AUTOMATE AIR
CONDITIONING REPAIR OR PLUMBING.

00:04:01.207 --> 00:04:10.149
IT’S EASY TO AUTOMATE
BOOKKEEPING, ACCOUNTING, AND A
LOT OF THE ENTRY-LEVEL
WHITE-COLLAR JOBS.

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:22.461
WE NEED TO DRAMATICALLY CHANNEL
MORE OF OUR RESOURCES TOWARDS
TECHNICAL AND VOCATIONAL TRENDS
THAT WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG
TIME.

00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:28.785
THEY ARE GOOD, SOLID JOBS THAT
PEOPLE ENJOY.

00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:31.537
ADAM: ANOTHER SOCIAL MEDIA
QUESTION.

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:33.455
THIS ONE FROM PATRICK COLLIS.

00:04:33.455 --> 00:04:37.676
HOW ABOUT PAY OFF THE DEFICIT,
THEN MANDATE A BALANCED BUDGET?

00:04:37.676 --> 00:04:42.281
MR. YANG: 40 OUT OF 50 STATES
HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET
AMENDMENT.

00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:45.985
WE ARE THE RICHEST COUNTRY IN
THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.

00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:48.454
WE ARE ALSO THE GLOBAL RESERVE
CURRENCY.

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:50.990
WE CAN MAKE MOVES TO BENEFIT THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.004
THAT’S WHAT WE SHOULD DO.

00:04:54.004 --> 00:04:58.497
RUNNING THIS MASSIVE DEFICIT IS
NOT A GOOD THING.

00:04:58.497 --> 00:05:02.434
WE SHOULD TRY TO BRING IT DOWN
IN VARIOUS WAYS.

00:05:02.434 --> 00:05:06.372
A BALANCED BUDGET WOULD BE THE
WRONG WAY TO GO.

00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:10.784
I WOULD BRING THE DEFICIT DOWN.

00:05:10.784 --> 00:05:23.952
A BALANCED BUDGET WOULD BE A
GOAL THAT WOULD DO MORE HARM IN
THE SHORT RUN THEN GOOD.

00:05:23.952 --> 00:05:31.463
BEST MAN GOOD -- MORE HARM IN
THE SHORT RUN DTHAN GOOD.

00:05:31.463 --> 00:05:40.039
A LOT OF THAT MONEY IS NOT GOING
TOWARDS THE TWO THREATS OF TODAY
-- TRUE THREATS OF TODAY.

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:52.300
CLIMATE CHANGE, CYBERSECURITY,
AI, LOOSE NUCLEAR MATERIALS AND
HAVING MORE AIRCRAFT CARRIERS
AND EQUIPMENT DOESN’T PROTECT US
AGAINST THAT.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:06:06.498
CHINA AND RUSSIA COULD PROBABLY
SHUT DOWN OUR POWER PLANTS
THROUGH OUR INFRASTRUCTURE --
THAT IS THE DANGER OF THE 20%
THREE.

00:06:06.498 --> 00:06:11.211
-- OF THE 21ST CENTURY.

00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:20.101
WE NEED TO START DIRECTING THOSE
DOLLARS TOWARD PROTECTING OUR
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:06:20.101 --> 00:06:23.324
ADAM: NEXT QUESTION FROM GAIL
TAYLOR.

00:06:23.324 --> 00:06:27.086
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU SUPPORT OVERTURNING
CITIZENS UNITED?

00:06:27.086 --> 00:06:30.513
MR. YANG: VERY MUCH SO.

00:06:30.513 --> 00:06:34.583
THAT WAS THE WORST DECISION
EVER.

00:06:34.583 --> 00:06:47.473
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU NEED A CAUSE
ADDITIONAL AMENDMENT TO OVERTURN
IT -- YOU NEED A CONSTITUTIONAL
AMENDMENT TO OVERTURN IT.

00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:52.033
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A BAD
DECISION.

00:06:52.033 --> 00:06:58.960
ADAM: JUST ABOUT EVERY VOTER
HERE IS INTERESTED IN THE
SUPREME COURT.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:09.928
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ANY
POTENTIAL SUPREME COURT JUSTICE
NOMINEE -- IN A POTENTIAL
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE NOMINEE?

00:07:09.928 --> 00:07:21.229
MR. YANG: WHAT THE REPUBLICANS
DID BY SANDBAGGING MAYOR GARLAND
WAS UNPRECEDENTED -- MERRICK
GARLAND WAS UNPRECEDENTED.

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:24.974
THAT ENDED UP TIPPING THE
BALANCE OF THE COURT.

00:07:24.974 --> 00:07:31.216
AT THIS POINT, YOU HAVE TO TRY
TO UNDO SOME OF WHAT HAS BEEN
DONE.

00:07:31.216 --> 00:07:41.794
I WOULD BE LOOKING FOR JUSTICE
THAT HAS VIEWS THAT ALIGN WITH
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN TERMS OF
 MOVING SOCIETIES
FORWARD.

00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:48.333
SOME OF THE JUSTICES APPOINTED
RECENTLY WILL MOVE US THE OTHER
WAY.

00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:52.442
ADAM: YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOUR
JUSTICE BELIEVES.

00:07:52.442 --> 00:07:57.005
MR. YANG: I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL
INTO CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.

00:07:57.005 --> 00:08:01.113
I UNDERSTAND THE LEGAL BACKDROP
OF THE SUPREME COURT.

00:08:01.113 --> 00:08:06.830
I WOULD APPOINTED JUSTICE THAT
IS ALIGNED WITH THE VALUES OF
PEOPLE WHO VOTED ME INTO OFFICE.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:17.930
&gt;&gt; THE IDEA THAT SO MANY OF THE
MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME COURT ARE
FOR THE SAME ACADEMIC
INSTITUTIONS, THE SAME
BACKGROUND -- IS IT TIME TO FIND
JUSTICES WITH A MORE VARIED

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:18.430
EXPERIENCE?

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:27.513
MR. YANG: LITERALLY, THEY ARE
PICKING JUSTICE BASED UPON THEIR
YOUTH SO THEY CAN STICK AROUND
FOR A FEW MORE YEARS.

00:08:27.513 --> 00:08:30.055
THE WHOLE THING IS SO PERVERSE.

00:08:30.055 --> 00:08:33.445
WE HAVE TO MOVE TO 18 YEAR
TERMS.

00:08:33.445 --> 00:08:39.600
THAT WAY, EVERY PRESIDENT WOULD
HAVE TWO APPOINTMENTS.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:53.565
IN TERMS OF INSTITUTIONS, SURE,
RELYING UPON ACADEMIC PEDIGREE
AT THIS POINT -- SOME OF THE
BEST JUSTICES DID NOT GO TO THE
SAME SCHOOLS.

00:08:53.565 --> 00:09:06.945
&gt;&gt; IN THIS TIME OF WHAT APPEARS
TO BE EXTREMISM IN BOTH PARTIES,
WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST CAN BE
DONE TO BRING A SPIRIT OF
COMPROMISE AND CIVILITY BACK TO
THE POLITICAL PROCESS?

00:09:06.945 --> 00:09:10.482
MR. YANG: WE’VE BEEN DISTRACTED
BY A LOT OF THINGS.

00:09:10.482 --> 00:09:15.487
WE NEED TO FOCUS ON SOLUTIONS
AND THINGS WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE
PEOPLE’S LIVES.

00:09:15.487 --> 00:09:19.157
THAT’S WHY THE FREEDOM DIVIDEND
IS THE CENTERPIECE OF MY PLAN.

00:09:19.157 --> 00:09:20.545
THAT IS VERY BIPARTISAN.

00:09:20.545 --> 00:09:22.628
IT IS NOT LEFT OR RIGHT.

00:09:22.628 --> 00:09:24.190
IT IS FORWARD.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:34.606
AFTER WE DO THIS, THE BIG HOPE
IS WE CAN REVERSE THE MINDSET OF
SCARCITY THAT IS OVERTAKING OUR
COMMUNITIES.

00:09:34.606 --> 00:09:36.934
AMERICANS ARE NOT DOING WELL.

00:09:36.934 --> 00:09:44.850
IF YOU CAN’T PAY YOUR BILLS,
IT’S MUCH EASIER TO BECOME
NEGATIVE ABOUT OTHER TYPES OF
PEOPLE.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:57.923
IF WE REVERSE THIS MINDSET OF
SCARCITY AND REPLACE IT WITH A
MINDSET OF ABUNDANCE AND
OPTIMISM AND GENEROSITY,
HOPEFULLY, WE CAN BRING THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE TOGETHER.

00:09:57.923 --> 00:10:04.983
ADAM: I AM CURIOUS, WHAT DO YOU
DO WHEN YOU GET THE BLAST OF
NEGATIVITY ON SOCIAL MEDIA?

00:10:04.983 --> 00:10:13.454
YOU TWEET SOMETHING ABOUT
POLICY, AND WHETHER IT IS BOUGHT
OR REAL PEOPLE COMING AFTER YOU,
HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT?

00:10:13.454 --> 00:10:24.285
MR. YANG: IN MY CASE, ANY
NEGATIVITY IS A GOOD THING, JUST
BECAUSE IT MEANS PEOPLE ARE
DIGGING INTO THE PROPOSALS THAT
I HAVE FOR THE ECONOMY AND THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

00:10:24.285 --> 00:10:28.827
AND I AM NOT THE SORT THAT
EXPECT EVERYONE TO AGREE WITH
ME.

00:10:28.827 --> 00:10:34.128
IF PEOPLE COME TO ME WITH
QUALITY ARGUMENTS AND FACTS, I
AM OPEN TO CONSIDERING THEM.

00:10:34.128 --> 00:10:43.075
IF THEY ARE JUST STARTING THINGS
ARE NOT FACTUAL AND SEEMS LIKE
HOSTILITY FOR THE SAKE OF
HOSTILITY, IT IS EASY TO PUT IT
ASIDE AND IGNORE.

00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:48.380
BUT I HAVE TO SAY I AM NOT
GETTING MUCH HOSTILITY AT ALL.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.184
THE HOSTILITY IS SOMETHING LIKE
100 TO 1.

00:10:52.184 --> 00:10:59.217
WE HAVE RAISED HALF A MILLION
DOLLARS FROM EVERYDAY AMERICANS
IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS.

00:10:59.217 --> 00:11:07.639
SO THERE IS A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM
FOR THIS VISION IN THE ECONOMY,
AND THE NEGATIVITY, FRANKLY, I
HAVE NOT SEEN MUCH OF.

00:11:07.639 --> 00:11:10.202
AND I’VE BEEN ON FOX FOUR TIMES.

00:11:10.202 --> 00:11:11.436
FIVE.

00:11:11.436 --> 00:11:12.504
I CANNOT EVEN KEEP TRACK.

00:11:12.504 --> 00:11:22.781
[LAUGHTER]
ADAM: CAT MCAFEE ASKED "SHOULD
THE GOVERNMENT FORCE THE NCAA TO
PAY ITS ATHLETES?"
MR. YANG: 100% YES.

00:11:22.781 --> 00:11:28.066
IF YOU GO TO MY WEBSITE, YOU SEE
I HAVE 76 POLICIES.

00:11:28.066 --> 00:11:29.388
BAN ROBO CALLING.

00:11:29.388 --> 00:11:32.891
GET A PSYCHOLOGIST IN THE WHITE
HOUSE.

00:11:32.891 --> 00:11:34.393
FORGIVE STUDENT LOANS.

00:11:34.393 --> 00:11:35.740
AND PAY NCAA ATHLETES.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:44.836
IT IS WRONG TO MAKE -- EXPLOIT
YOUNG PEOPLE MAKING MILLIONS OF
DOLLARS, AND MEANWHILE YOUR
PAYING THE COACH AND ATHLETIC
DIRECTOR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF
DOLLARS.

00:11:44.836 --> 00:11:47.669
WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE IS THAT?

00:11:47.669 --> 00:11:53.597
IT IS OK TO EXPLOIT YOUNG PEOPLE
WHO ARE TAKING RISKS FOR THEIR
BODIES?

00:11:53.597 --> 00:11:55.714
SO 100%, PAID REVENUE-GENERATING
ASSETS.

00:11:55.714 --> 00:12:00.762
THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO SIGN
MEMORABILIA AND GET THE SHARE OF
THEIR MERCHANDISE.

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:05.090
ADAM: SO THE REVENUE GENERATING
ASSETS, MAYBE NOT THE CLUB
SOCCER TEAM?

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:11.630
[LAUGHTER]
MR. YANG: YEAH, IT WOULD BE
REVENUE-GENERATING.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:24.576
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE PLAYING IN A
GIANT, SOLD-OUT ARENA, AND
PEOPLE ARE PAYING LOTS OF MONEY,
AND THE SCHOOL IS MAKING TONS OF
MONEY, IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE
FOR THE STUDENTS TO BE SCRAPING

00:12:24.576 --> 00:12:24.965
BY.

00:12:24.965 --> 00:12:28.080
ADAM: THAT WOULD BE ON TOP OF
THE?

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.331
U.B.I..

00:12:29.331 --> 00:12:31.249
MR. YANG: YEAH.

00:12:31.249 --> 00:12:36.836
IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN, IT IS LIKE
WHY IS SCHOOL SO EXPENSIVE NOW?

00:12:36.836 --> 00:12:41.165
WHEN YOU LOOK IT UP, YOU ARE
LIKE HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

00:12:41.165 --> 00:12:45.968
I WILL TRY TO BRING IT DOWN BY
TYING THE COST RATIO DOWN TO
FEDERAL LOAN ACCESS.

00:12:45.968 --> 00:12:51.336
ALSO PUTTING $1000 A MONTH INTO
YOUR HANDS AND THE HANDS OF YOUR
CHILDREN WILL MAKE A HUGE
DIFFERENCE.

00:12:51.336 --> 00:12:55.500
IF SOMEONE SHOWS UP TO COLLEGE,
THEY WOULD BE GETTING UNIVERSAL
BASIC INCOME.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:00.946
MOST OF THAT GOES TO TUITION,
BUT IF THEY ARE EIGHT
REVENUE-GENERATING ATHLETE, THEY
SHOULD GET IT.

00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:04.449
ADAM: LET’S MIGRATE BACK TO THE
MIDDLE HERE.

00:13:04.449 --> 00:13:09.154
LET’S GO TO CLARA MONIER
FOR A QUESTION.

00:13:09.154 --> 00:13:10.442
CLARA: GOOD MORNING.

00:13:10.442 --> 00:13:16.027
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING YOUR
INTERESTING PROPOSALS TO US HERE
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.

00:13:16.027 --> 00:13:24.387
I AM INTERESTED IN WHAT YOU’RE
PROPOSALS ARE FOR THE SOCIAL
SECURITY SYSTEM.

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:28.673
IT HAS BEEN PREDICTED TO BE -25%
IN 2035.

00:13:28.673 --> 00:13:34.038
IF SOME CHANGES ARE MADE NOW,
MAYBE THE CRISIS CAN BE AVERTED.

00:13:34.038 --> 00:13:36.927
LISTENING TO YOUR IDEAS WOULD BE
VERY INTERESTING.

00:13:36.927 --> 00:13:44.156
MR. YANG: SOCIAL SECURITY IS
SCHEDULED TO GO BANKRUPT IN A
NUMBER OF YEARS, BUT THE TRUTH
IS SOCIAL SECURITY’S BANKRUPTCY
IS AN ACCOUNTING FICTION.

00:13:44.156 --> 00:13:52.631
THE WAY THEY SET IT UP IS YOU
PUT MONEY ASIDE AND GET BACK
YOUR MONEY, BUT THE TRUTH IS THE
MONEY YOU HAVE BEEN PUTTING IN
HAS BEEN GOING TO OTHER THINGS,
AND NEW MONEY IS GOING TO COME

00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:54.166
IN.

00:13:54.166 --> 00:14:02.374
THE WAY SOCIAL SECURITY GETS
FINANCED, IF YOU WERE A MOTHER
AND DID NOT BUILD UP A WORK
HISTORY, YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY
BENEFITS ARE LOWER.

00:14:02.374 --> 00:14:05.869
THAT IS PART OF THE WAY THE
SYSTEM IS SET UP.

00:14:05.869 --> 00:14:08.951
I WOULD DRAMATICALLY STRENGTHEN
AND REVAMP THE SOCIAL SECURITY
SYSTEM.

00:14:08.951 --> 00:14:11.912
YOU WOULD HAVE NO FEAR OF IT
GOING BACK UP EVER AGAIN.

00:14:11.912 --> 00:14:15.120
WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT KIND OF
COUNTRY WE ARE GOING TO BE.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:25.386
WE KNOW MILLIONS OF AMERICANS DO
NOT HAVE ADEQUATE RETIREMENT
SAVINGS, AND WE ARE HEADING INTO
AN ERA WHERE WE WILL SEE UTTERLY
AMERICANS WORKING AT A
CONVENIENCE STORE UNTIL THE DAY

00:14:25.386 --> 00:14:27.515
THEY DIE AND DYING ON THE
STREETS.

00:14:27.515 --> 00:14:31.202
OR WE GET OUR ACT TOGETHER AND
SAY WE ARE A MORAL COUNTRY.

00:14:31.202 --> 00:14:39.711
AND IF YOU ARE A CITIZEN OF THIS
COUNTRY AND OUR PAST A CERTAIN
AGE, YOU SHOULD BE GETTING
ENOUGH SO YOU CAN LIVE IN A
DIGNIFIED AND QUALITY
RETIREMENT.

00:14:39.711 --> 00:14:44.549
$1000 A MONTH WOULD GO A LONG
WAY FOR AMERICANS THE ENTIRE WAY
UP.

00:14:44.549 --> 00:14:49.621
BUT THE ENTIRE BANKRUPTCY OF
SOCIAL SECURITY IS SOMETHING WE
CAN COME TOGETHER AND CHANGE IF
WE DECIDE TO DO SO.

00:14:49.621 --> 00:14:50.942
CLARA: THANK YOU.

00:14:50.942 --> 00:14:56.015
MR. YANG: I HAVE PARENTS, TOO,
LET ME PUT IT THAT WAY.

00:14:56.015 --> 00:14:58.129
MY PARENTS ARE STILL ALIVE.

00:14:58.129 --> 00:15:02.984
HAVING ELDERLY AMERICANS
STRUGGLE TO THAT DEGREE IS
IMMORAL.

00:15:02.984 --> 00:15:07.321
ADAM: YOUR WEBSITE HAS MORE
POLICY POSITIONS THAN MOST.

00:15:07.321 --> 00:15:10.602
MR. YANG: AND THERE ARE NEW ONES
COMING.

00:15:10.602 --> 00:15:19.217
ADAM: ONE OF THE INTERESTING
ONES THAT CAUGHT MY EYE WAS THIS
IDEA OF DOING SOMETHING ABOUT
LOST I’VE BECOME DEFUNCT.

00:15:19.217 --> 00:15:22.470
-- THAT HAVE BECOME -- LAWS THAT
HAVE BECOME DEFUNCT.

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:28.326
MR. YANG: SO HOW MANY OF YOU
HAVE BEEN TO A GHOST MALL OR A
MALL EMPTYING OUT.

00:15:28.326 --> 00:15:29.277
IT IS SCARY.

00:15:29.277 --> 00:15:31.172
YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE THERE.

00:15:31.172 --> 00:15:32.797
IT SEEMS LIKE A CRIME ZONE.

00:15:32.797 --> 00:15:40.505
WHEN THOSE THINGS GO EMPTY, THEY
SPREAD BLIGHT FOR MILES AND
MILES AND DEPRESS PROPERTY
VALUES.

00:15:40.505 --> 00:15:46.011
AS THESE MALLS CLOSE, IT
BEHOOVES US TO FIND A GREAT IF
USE FOR THEM, IF WE CAN.

00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:52.522
IT HAS HAPPENED IN PART OF THE
COUNTRY WHERE THEY ARE GETTING
USED AS CHURCHES, COMMUNITY
SPACES, OFFICES, SOMETIMES
RESIDENTIAL.

00:15:52.522 --> 00:15:57.881
THEY ARE POORLY DESIGNED FOR
SOME OF THESE THINGS, BUT YOU
CAN MAKE MOVES IN THIS
DIRECTION.

00:15:57.881 --> 00:16:08.600
I WILL PASS THE AMERICAN MALL
ACT THAT WILL MATCH FUNDS SO IF
A COMMUNITY HAS A CREATIVE USE
FOR THAT MALL, THEY WILL GET
BACKING FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO
HELP MAKE THAT TRANSITION.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:15.882
BECAUSE IF YOU CAN REVIVE THAT
MALL, IT IS A HUGE VALUE SAVINGS
OR THAT COMMUNITY.

00:16:15.882 --> 00:16:18.343
IF THAT MALL GOES DARK, THE
BLIGHT WILL SPREAD.

00:16:18.343 --> 00:16:21.813
THIS IS HAPPENING TO ALMOST ONE
THIRD OF AMERICAN MALLS IN THE
NEXT FIVE YEARS.

00:16:21.813 --> 00:16:23.481
BECAUSE OF WHAT?

00:16:23.481 --> 00:16:24.002
AMAZON.

00:16:24.002 --> 00:16:29.220
ADAM: THE CARDBOARD BOX INDUSTRY
IS DOING VERY WELL, THOUGH.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:38.962
YOU SAY YOU WANT TO BRING DOWN
OVERDOSE NUMBERS AND OPIOID
ADDICTION BY 20% OVER FOUR
YEARS.

00:16:38.962 --> 00:16:41.294
HOW DO YOU ACHIEVE THAT GOAL?

00:16:41.294 --> 00:16:46.738
MR. YANG: THERE IS AN AMERICAN
IDEA THAT YOU CANNOT TREAT DRUGS
WITH DRUGS.

00:16:46.738 --> 00:16:53.511
IT TURNS OUT, AT LEAST IN SOME
COUNTRIES, THEY HAVE BEEN
PROVIDING NONADDICTIVE DRUG
SUBSTITUTES.

00:16:53.511 --> 00:17:02.320
FRANCE, FOR EXAMPLE, LOWERED ITS
HEROINE OVERDOSE RATE BY MAKING
A NONADDICTIVE DRUG SUBSTITUTE
FREELY AVAILABLE.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:07.353
THAT IS WHAT WE WOULD DO IN THE
U.S.

00:17:07.353 --> 00:17:11.972
NOT JUST THE NALOXONE, BUT ALSO
SUBSTITUTES TO HELP PEOPLE
MANAGE ADDICTION.

00:17:11.972 --> 00:17:19.671
BECAUSE THERE IS NO RIGHT WAY TO
GET OFF OF DRUGS, WE HAVE TO
MAKE EVERY TOOL AVAILABLE TO
PEOPLE.

00:17:19.671 --> 00:17:23.488
WE CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT LEAVE
ANYTHING OFF THE TABLE,
INCLUDING NONADDICTIVE DRUG
SUBSTITUTES.

00:17:23.488 --> 00:17:28.480
ADAM: IN ONE OF THE THINGS YOU
MENTIONED IS YOU WANT A
PSYCHOLOGIST IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.214
WHAT ROLE DOES THIS PERSON PLAY?

00:17:32.214 --> 00:17:41.604
OBVIOUSLY, THERE IS A CLEAR ONE
MEDICALLY, BUT IN TERMS OF HOW
THE RESIDENT WILL MAKE --
PRESIDENT MAKE DECISIONS.

00:17:41.604 --> 00:17:45.402
MR. YANG: SO MY BROTHER IS A
PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSOR.

00:17:45.402 --> 00:17:48.715
MY OLDER BROTHER IS A PSYCHOLOGY
PROFESSOR AT NYU.

00:17:48.715 --> 00:17:54.016
WE KNOW PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT ARE
UNDER A LOT OF STRESS, MAKING
VERY IMPORTANT DECISIONS.

00:17:54.016 --> 00:17:58.209
AND MENTAL HEALTH IS GOING TO BE
THE LAST THING ON PEOPLE’S
MINDS.

00:17:58.209 --> 00:18:04.983
IF YOU GET A MENTAL HEALTH
RESOURCE INTO THE WHITE HOUSE,
ONE, IT D STIGMATIZES MENTAL
HEALTH ISSUES AROUND THE
COUNTRY.

00:18:04.983 --> 00:18:06.484
WE ALL HAVE STRUGGLES.

00:18:06.484 --> 00:18:09.329
WE ALL BENEFIT FROM HAVING SOME
SORT OF RESOURCES.

00:18:09.329 --> 00:18:19.764
TWO, IN REAL TERMS, THE CHIEF OF
STAFF, WITH A MENTAL HEALTH
RESOURCE, IF THEY NOTICE SOMEONE
IS STRESSED OUT AND STRUGGLING,
THEY CAN SAY YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
SEE THAT PERSON, YOU ARE

00:18:19.764 --> 00:18:20.131
STRUGGLING.

00:18:20.131 --> 00:18:31.376
AND IT TURNS OUT WE’LL HAVE TO
SEE THAT PERSON PERIODICALLY, SO
IF THE PSYCHOLOGIST SAYS THIS
PARTICULAR PERSON IS STRUGGLING
IN A PARTICULAR WAY, YOU CAN
START TRYING TO MAKE MOVES.

00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:41.646
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CANNOT
HAVE IS YOU CANNOT HAVE THIS
SUPERMAN, SUPERWOMAN CULTURE
WHERE EVERYONE PRETENDS TO BE
SUPERHUMAN, AND THEN YOU WIND UP
WITH REAL PROBLEMS IN MYSTICS

00:18:41.646 --> 00:18:45.290
BEING MADE AND DECISIONS BEING
MADE THAT SHOULD NOT BE MADE.

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:53.634
ADAM: CERTAINLY WE SEE THE
PRESIDENT THESE DAYS AGING AND
OFFICE QUITE A BIT FROM GEORGE
W. BUSH TO PRESIDENT OBAMA.

00:18:53.634 --> 00:18:57.937
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE A
PRETTY GOOD JOB OF UPKEEP, I
GUESS.

00:18:57.937 --> 00:19:00.805
MR. YANG: BECAUSE HIS HAIR IS
NOT REAL.

00:19:00.805 --> 00:19:03.766
ADAM: WHAT ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE?

00:19:03.766 --> 00:19:07.912
MR. YANG: IT IS A COMPLICATED
PROBLEM.

00:19:07.912 --> 00:19:12.238
GUNS SHOULD BE TREATED SIMILARLY
TO AUTOMOBILES.

00:19:12.238 --> 00:19:19.777
WE HAVE TEXANS --
WE HAVE TESTING AND LICENSING
FOR AUTOMOBILES BECAUSE THEY CAN
KILL PEOPLE.

00:19:19.777 --> 00:19:30.165
THAT SAID, THERE ARE 300 MILLION
FIREARMS OWNED BY CITIZENS, AND
THERE IS NO REALISTIC WAY YOU
CAN REDUCE THAT NUMBER
DRAMATICALLY IN A SHORT PERIOD
OF TIME.

00:19:30.165 --> 00:19:39.811
A LOT OF IT THE INVESTMENT
SHOULD BE MADE AROUND THINGS
LIKE MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES AND
THINGS TO KEEP PEOPLE STRONG,
PARTICULARLY IN THE SCHOOL
ENVIRONMENT.

00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:49.359
IN MANY SCHOOLS, THERE IS A
TROUBLED BOY, AND EVERYONE KNOWS
THE BOY IS TROUBLED, BUT NO ONE
WANTS TO RAISE THE ALARM ABOUT
IT.

00:19:49.359 --> 00:20:01.199
MY BROTHER, THE PSYCHOLOGIST,
KNOWS THAT IF YOU HAVE ADEQUATE
RESOURCES, YOU CAN PREEMPT SOME
OF THESE SITUATIONS SO WHAT --
ADAM: SO WHAT DO YOU DO TO GET
AROUND THIS?

00:20:01.199 --> 00:20:04.174
WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT THAT
TROUBLED BOY?

00:20:04.174 --> 00:20:16.447
MR. YANG: IF PEOPLE FEEL
COMFORTABLE AND THERE IS A
RESOURCE THERE AND WE LISTEN TO
OUR CHILDREN, AND THEY SAY
IT SEEMS THAT BOY IS STRUGGLING,
FIRST WE NEED TO CREATE A

00:20:16.447 --> 00:20:17.648
CULTURE THAT ACKNOWLEDGES
STRUGGLE.

00:20:17.648 --> 00:20:23.955
IT CANNOT BE THAT IF SOMEONE
SAYS YOU ARE STRUGGLING, THAT IS
SOMEHOW STIGMATIZED AND MARKS
YOU IN A NEGATIVE WAY.

00:20:23.955 --> 00:20:32.230
SECOND IS YOU HAVE REAL
RESOURCES AT WORK TO TRY AND
INTERVENE AND IMPROVE AND
SUPPORT THAT YOUNG PERSON.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:42.707
GENERALLY, A YOUNG BOY, BECAUSE
WE KNOW YOUNG BOYS ARE MUCH MORE
LIKELY TO INFLICT GUN VIOLENCE
ON THEIR PEERS THAN OTHERS.

00:20:42.707 --> 00:20:47.946
ADAM: LET’S JUMP BACK ON THE
TECH CONVERSATION.

00:20:47.946 --> 00:20:51.716
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT NET
NEUTRALITY, AND WHY SHOULD THAT
MATTER?

00:20:51.716 --> 00:20:57.445
MR. YANG: THE BIG THING IS
SHOULD BIG COMPANIES PAY TO HAVE
BETTER INTERNET ACCESS THAN
OTHERS?

00:20:57.445 --> 00:21:01.428
IF YOU THINK THAT IS A BAD IDEA,
YOU ARE FOR NET NEUTRALITY.

00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:02.961
I AM FOR NET NEUTRALITY.

00:21:02.961 --> 00:21:08.032
BIG COMPANIES HAVE ENOUGH
ADVANTAGES.

00:21:08.032 --> 00:21:10.234
SO I AM PRO NET NEUTRALITY.

00:21:10.234 --> 00:21:12.804
IT IS THE LEAST WE CAN DO.

00:21:12.804 --> 00:21:15.958
EVEN WITH NET NEUTRALITY, THERE
ARE MASSIVE ADVANTAGES.

00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:20.798
ADAM: IN TERMS OF THE REGULAR
PERSON, WHY SHOULD THEY CARE
ABOUT THIS ISSUE?

00:21:20.798 --> 00:21:29.787
MR. YANG: THE QUESTION IS
WHETHER YOU WANT A LEVEL PLAYING
FIELD ONLINE FOR VENDORS, FOR
PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO REACH
YOU, FOR CONTENT PROVIDERS.

00:21:29.787 --> 00:21:40.854
IF YOU WERE GETTING BETTER
SPEEDS FROM CERTAIN PROVIDERS,
YOU WOULD USE THEM MORE, AND IT
WOULD CONSOLIDATE POWER IN THE
HANDS OF THE LARGEST COMPANIES.

00:21:40.854 --> 00:21:45.059
ADAM: ANOTHER SOCIAL MEDIA
QUESTION COMING IN, THIS ONE
FROM ANDY.

00:21:45.059 --> 00:21:45.924
THIS IS A LITTLE POINTED.

00:21:45.924 --> 00:21:49.907
HE SAYS, "SO I GET A $1,000 A
MONTH FOR BUSTING MY  BUTT AT
WORK, AND SOMEBODY ELSE GETS
$1000 FOR NOT WORKING?

00:21:49.907 --> 00:21:59.121
AM I UNDERSTANDING THIS
CORRECTLY?"
MR. YANG: IF YOU’RE BUSTING YOUR
BUTT AT WORK, PRESUMABLY YOU ARE
GETTING PAID FOR THAT.

00:21:59.121 --> 00:22:06.624
SO YOU GET $1000 A MONTH FROM
THE RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD
AND YOUR EMPLOYER IS PAYING YOU.

00:22:06.624 --> 00:22:17.835
AND THE PERSON WHO IS NOT
WORKING, THEY ARE GETTING $1000
A MONTH, AND THEY SEE YOU COMING
HOME FROM WORK, THEY THINK MAYBE
I CAN GET MORE, GET A JOB.

00:22:17.835 --> 00:22:25.910
THE BIGGEST MISCONCEPTION IS
THAT THE FREEDOM DIVIDEND WILL
SOMEHOW MITIGATE WORK -- IT WILL
NOT SPEED IT WILL CREATE TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:31.549
IF YOU ARE GETTING AN EXTRA
$12,000 A YEAR, HOW MUCH OF THAT
WILL BE SPENT RIGHT IN YOUR
COMMUNITY?

00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:34.118
MOST OF IT.

00:22:34.118 --> 00:22:39.724
TUTORING, FOOD FOR YOUR KIDS,
CAR REPAIRS YOU HAVE BEEN
PUTTING OFF, THE OCCASIONAL
NIGHT OUT.

00:22:39.724 --> 00:22:41.200
IT STAYS HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.661
SOME OF IT GOES TO JEFF BEZOS
AND THE GANG.

00:22:43.661 --> 00:22:45.420
YOU WILL DO SOME AMAZONING.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.532
FOR MOST OF IT STAYS HERE.

00:22:47.532 --> 00:22:52.886
THAT WILL BE TRUE FOR THAT
GENTLEMAN’S COMMUNITY AS WELL.

00:22:52.886 --> 00:22:58.068
HE WILL GET THE MONEY FROM HIS
JOB AND HIS DIVIDEND.

00:22:58.068 --> 00:23:01.419
ADAM: YOU ARE ALREADY CONDUCTING
YOUR EXPERIMENT IN NEW
HAMPSHIRE.

00:23:01.419 --> 00:23:07.452
YOU HAVE A FAMILY AND CROSSTOWN,
WHERE YOU ARE JUST PAYING THEM
WITH THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH
YOURSELF.

00:23:07.452 --> 00:23:13.524
WHEN YOU DOTHAT, ARE YOU
TREATING -- ARE YOU KEEPING
TRACK OF WHAT THEY DO?

00:23:13.524 --> 00:23:17.547
ARE YOU TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF
THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL WITH THAT
MONEY?

00:23:17.547 --> 00:23:21.983
MR. YANG: I AM NOT EVEN SURE
THEY SPENT THE FIRST $2000 THAT
THEY HAVE GOTTEN.

00:23:21.983 --> 00:23:24.202
AND IF THEY DO NOT, THAT IS
GREAT.

00:23:24.202 --> 00:23:30.296
IF THEY SPEND IT ON SOMETHING
THAT MAKES THEIR LIVES BETTER,
ALSO GREAT.

00:23:30.296 --> 00:23:33.062
THE FOSSI FAMILY IN GOFFSTOWN,
NEW HAMPSHIRE.

00:23:33.062 --> 00:23:36.631
I AM DOING THE SAME FOR A FAMILY
IN IOWA.

00:23:36.631 --> 00:23:38.240
HERE IS WHAT IS INSPIRATIONAL.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:48.468
A COUPLE IN GEORGIA WAS SO
INSPIRED THEY ARE GIVING $1000 A
MONTH TO A FAMILY IN SOUTH
CAROLINA THEY HAVE NEVER MET,
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IS THE
RIGHT THING TO DO.

00:23:48.468 --> 00:23:49.559
WE CAN IMPROVE AMERICANS LIVES
QUICKLY.

00:23:49.559 --> 00:23:51.195
I AM NOT CHECKING IN ON THEM AT
ALL.

00:23:51.195 --> 00:23:53.411
WHATEVER THEY DO WILL BE GREAT.

00:23:53.411 --> 00:24:01.539
ADAM: LET’S CHECK ON AN ISSUE IN
A HOT BUTTON --
MR. YANG: I KIND OF KNOW WHERE
THE MONEY WILL GO.

00:24:01.539 --> 00:24:03.861
IT WILL GO TO JANELLE’S COLLEGE
TUITION.

00:24:03.861 --> 00:24:07.512
SO THAT IS WHERE THE MONEY IS
GOING, I AM SURE.

00:24:07.512 --> 00:24:13.743
ADAM: LET’S TALK ABOUT AN ISSUE
IMPORTANT TO NEW HAMPSHIRE RIGHT
NOW.

00:24:13.743 --> 00:24:15.820
THE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:19.616
WHERE DO YOU STAND ON
LEGALIZATION AND MEDICAL
MARIJUANA?

00:24:19.616 --> 00:24:26.219
MR. YANG: I AM FOR THE FULL
LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA AND
REMOVING IT FROM THE FEDERAL
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES LIST.

00:24:26.219 --> 00:24:29.000
IT IS BETTER FOR MANAGING PAIN
THAN OPIATES.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:29.742
LESS DANGEROUS.

00:24:29.742 --> 00:24:31.969
WE STILL NEED TO REGULATE IT.

00:24:31.969 --> 00:24:35.745
YOU CAN HAVE SOMETHING THE LEGAL
AND REGULATE IT.

00:24:35.745 --> 00:24:45.545
BUT TO ME, IT IS CLEAR THAT OUR
ADMINISTRATION OF THE
CRIMINALIZATION OF IT HAS NOT
BEEN EQUITABLE, AND WE SHOULD
LEGALIZE IT FULLY.

00:24:45.545 --> 00:24:48.767
ADAM: LET’S TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY.

00:24:48.767 --> 00:25:01.299
HOW WOULD YOU PLAN TO USE ALL OF
YOUR FRIENDS IN TECH, ALL OF
THIS AI, ALL OF THESE GREAT
THINGS HAPPENING, HOW DO YOU
APPLY THAT TO THE PROBLEM OF
SUPERFUND SITES THAT ARE

00:25:01.299 --> 00:25:03.567
POLLUTING DRINKING WATER,
CREATING HEALTH PROBLEMS?

00:25:03.567 --> 00:25:06.710
MR. YANG: I WISH THERE WAS A
TECH SOLUTION.

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:08.806
THERE MIGHT BE AT THE MARGINS.

00:25:08.806 --> 00:25:18.643
BUT WE NEED TO DO MUCH, MUCH
MORE TO POLICE SUPERFUND SITES
AND TIE CORPORATE INCENTIVES TO
OUR AIR AND WATERPROOF THE
PROBLEM IS THESE COMPANIES ARE
MAKING A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS

00:25:18.643 --> 00:25:23.254
AND SAY IF IT PAYS TO POLLUTE,
THAT IS WHAT I AM GOING TO DO.

00:25:23.254 --> 00:25:33.381
WE HAVE TO MAKE IT MORE COSTLY
FOR THEM TO POLLUTE WITH A
CARBON FEE AND DIVIDEND SYSTEM
AND CHANNEL THOSE RESOURCES TO
MAKING IT HARDER AND HARDER FOR
COMPANIES TO CUT CORNERS.

00:25:33.381 --> 00:25:43.508
ADAM: ON CLIMATE CHANGE, HOW DO
YOU PLAN TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN
AMERICA WHILE STILL ALLOW THE
DEVELOPING -- ALLOW THE
DEVELOPING WORLD TO DEVELOP AND
MAKING SURE THEY ARE NOT PUTTING

00:25:43.508 --> 00:25:45.910
TOO MUCH CARBON IN THE
ATMOSPHERE?

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:50.997
MR. YANG: THIS IS THE HARSH
TRUTH ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND
GLOBAL EMISSIONS.

00:25:50.997 --> 00:25:54.519
THE UNITED STATES IS ONLY 15% OF
GLOBAL EMISSIONS.

00:25:54.519 --> 00:26:02.610
EVEN IF WE WERE TO GO REALLY
EXTREME AND CUT OUR EMISSIONS
SIGNIFICANTLY, IT MIGHT CUT
GLOBAL EMISSIONS BY 5%.

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:06.422
THE FOUR WARMEST YEARS IN
HISTORY HAVE BEEN THE LAST FOUR
YEARS.

00:26:06.422 --> 00:26:10.150
AT THIS POINT, WE ARE ON THE
CURVE TOWARDS A WARMING PLANET.

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:17.608
IT IS NOT LIKE IF WE ALL OF US
ARE -- ALL OF A SUDDEN START
RECYCLING DILIGENTLY IT WILL
START TO COOL AGAIN.

00:26:17.608 --> 00:26:20.529
THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE
TECHNOLOGY WILL COME INTO PLAY.

00:26:20.529 --> 00:26:24.749
WE NEED TO INVEST IN
INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE US MORE
RESILIENT AND SUSTAINABLE.

00:26:24.749 --> 00:26:35.440
YOU SEE THAT AROUND THE COUNTRY,
THAT THERE ARE FLOODS AND
NATURAL DISASTERS THAT ARE
DANGEROUS TO PEOPLE, IN PART
BECAUSE INFRASTRUCTURE IS
FAILING.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:39.931
THEN WE NEED TO INVEST IN
REVERSING SOME OF THE MOST
SEVERE EFFECTS.

00:26:39.931 --> 00:26:47.031
IF HE CAN GET CARBON OUT OF THE
ATMOSPHERE AND FIND A WAY TO
SEQUESTER IT, THAT IS A ACTION
WE SHOULD GO IN.

00:26:47.031 --> 00:26:48.734
THAT IS WHERE TECHNOLOGY SHOULD
HELP.

00:26:48.734 --> 00:26:53.277
BUT WE HAVE TO START BEING
HONEST WITH THE FACT THAT WE ARE
NOT THE WORLD.

00:26:53.277 --> 00:26:58.784
IF WE REDUCED ADMISSIONS, THAT
WOULD HELP BUT WOULD NOT SOLVE
THE PROBLEM ENTIRELY.

00:26:58.784 --> 00:27:00.097
ADAM: ONE LAST QUESTION HERE.

00:27:00.097 --> 00:27:02.987
WE HAVE EXHAUSTED THE ROOM, SO I
AM FEELING IN HERE.

00:27:02.987 --> 00:27:05.222
LET’S TALK ABOUT THE VOTING
PROCESS.

00:27:05.222 --> 00:27:09.594
YOU WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO
VOTE ON THEIR SMARTPHONES.

00:27:09.594 --> 00:27:16.968
HOW DO YOU PROTECT INTERFERENCE,
WHEN WE KNOW SO MANY APPS HAVE
ALREADY GAINED ACCESS TO OUR
PHONES.

00:27:16.968 --> 00:27:20.346
HOW DO YOU PREVENT SOMEONE FROM
HAVING THEIR VOTES INTERFERED
WITH?

00:27:20.346 --> 00:27:27.411
MR. YANG: YOU WOULD NOT MOVE
TOWARD SMARTPHONE VOTING UNTIL
THE TECHNOLOGY IS READY FOR
PRIME TIME, WHICH, RIGHT NOW, IT
IS NOT.

00:27:27.411 --> 00:27:36.053
BUT THERE ARE TECHNOLOGIES ON
THE TABLE USING SOMETHING CALLED
THE BLOCK CHAIN THAT YOU CAN
TRUST INTRINSICALLY, BECAUSE IT
IS SOMETHING CALLED A PUBLIC
LEDGER.

00:27:36.053 --> 00:27:37.925
YOU CANNOT TAMPER WITH IT.

00:27:37.925 --> 00:27:39.423
EVERYONE CAN SEE IT.

00:27:39.423 --> 00:27:41.425
YOU CANNOT TAMPER WITH IT.

00:27:41.425 --> 00:27:45.943
THEN YOU COULD VOTE ON YOUR
SMARTPHONE AND CREATE A MORE
POWERFUL DEMOCRACY.

00:27:45.943 --> 00:27:49.767
THE OTHER THING -- I WOULD MAKE
ELECTION DAY A HOLIDAY.

00:27:49.767 --> 00:27:51.435
HOW IS IT NOT?

00:27:51.435 --> 00:27:54.431
SO WE NEED TO EMPOWER VOTERS IN
DIFFERENT WAYS.

00:27:54.431 --> 00:28:06.751
BUT IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE, AS A
MODERN SOCIETY, THAT WE CAN BANK
ONLINE AND PAY PARKING TICKETS
ONLINE, BUT THEN WE HAVE TO
STAND IN LINE AND PULL L
EVERS ON THESE MACHINES THAT ARE

00:28:06.751 --> 00:28:07.985
NOT TAMPER-PROOF.

00:28:07.985 --> 00:28:18.036
IF YOU MOVE TOWARDS A VOTING
SYSTEM WE CAN TRUST, THAT WOULD
BE THE VISION, BUT YOU DO NOT
MAKE THAT MOVE UNTIL THE
TECHNOLOGY IS READY.

00:28:18.036 --> 00:28:26.971
ADAM: I THINK YOU WILL HAVE A
FUN CONVERSATION WITH BILL
GARDNER AT SOME POINT BEFORE WE
GO, YOU WENT TO PHILLIPS EXETER
ACADEMY.

00:28:26.971 --> 00:28:29.659
WHAT IS YOUR FONDEST MEMORY
ABOUT THE GRANITE STATE?

00:28:29.659 --> 00:28:33.244
MR. YANG: I LEARNED TO SKI AS A
JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL.

00:28:33.244 --> 00:28:35.065
I HAD NEVER SKIED BEFORE.

00:28:35.065 --> 00:28:37.615
THERE WAS A SPEECH ABOUT EXIT
HER.

00:28:37.615 --> 00:28:39.750
I WAS LIKE, I WILL LEARN TO SKI.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:40.818
SO I GOT ON THE BUS.

00:28:40.818 --> 00:28:41.619
IT WAS A PAINFUL DAY.

00:28:41.619 --> 00:28:51.560
[LAUGHTER]
BUT THEN I WAS PROUD OF MYSELF
THAT I MANAGED TO CATCH UP TO MY
FRIENDS AND GO DOWN THE SLOPES
BY THE END OF THE DAY.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.864
I JUST SPOKE AT MY OLD HIGH
SCHOOL TWO WEEKS AGO.

00:28:54.864 --> 00:28:56.667
IT WAS HEARTWARMING TO BE BACK.

00:28:56.667 --> 00:29:01.927
I STILL HAVE FRIENDS HERE,
BECAUSE MANY OF MY FRIENDS’
PARENTS STILL LIVE HERE.

00:29:01.927 --> 00:29:05.309
ADAM: YOU TOOK YOUR BRUISING ON
THE SKI TRAIL.

00:29:05.309 --> 00:29:08.913
HOPEFULLY THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL
TREATS YOU MORE NICELY.

00:29:08.913 --> 00:29:12.821
ANDREW YANG, THANK YOU FOR
PARTICIPATING IN CONVERSATION
WITH CANDIDATES.

00:29:12.821 --> 00:29:17.121
THANK YOU TO THE STUDIO AUDIENCE
AND THE TOWN HALL QUESTIONS.

00:29:17.121 --> 00:29:22.326
AND THANK YOU FOR WATCHING ON
WMUR.COM AND ON OUR MOBILE APP.

00:29:22.326 --> 00:29:27.098
NEXT WEEK, JOHN DELANEY WILL BE
OUR NEXT GUEST ON CONVERSATION
WITH CANDIDATES.

00:29:27.098 --> 00:29:28.899
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING AND HAVE
A GREAT NIGHT.

00:29:28.899 --> 00:29:32.470
