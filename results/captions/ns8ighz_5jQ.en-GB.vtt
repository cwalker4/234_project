00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.160
Ladies and gentlemen,
who would like to play Send To All?

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.000
So, let's find out who is in
our Send To All box this morning!

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.720
I mean, this evening.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.680
It's the nation's sweetheart,
it's jolly Holly Willoughby.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.040
Holly!

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.800
Hello!

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.600
Hi, Holly, good evening. How are
you? I'm so good. How are you?

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.080
Thank you for coming.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.480
Now, this is a very exciting Send
To All, but this is blowing my mind.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.960
Yes, I brought my girls with me
tonight.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.560
Would you like to introduce the
crew - not that they necessarily

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.840
need introducing!

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.680
Who have we got, Holl? Well,
I've got my friend, Niki de Metz...

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.480
Niki. Then I've got Christine
Bleakley, who I think you might

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.160
all possibly know. Oh, Chrissie B.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.280
Gorgeous Nicole Appleton here,
who I think you might know as well.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.960
And also Shiarra.
Girls are in town.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.920
Girls' night. Girls' night.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.440
And you are all best friends? Yes.
So, Holl, exciting times for you?

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.040
Very. I mean, really...

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.960
I mean, it's quite scary times too.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.680
So you are going to Australia.
Yeah.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.760
So what about the stuff
on I'm A Celebrity...

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.120
And the creepy-crawlies and stuff?
Yeah, I'm not good with any of that.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.600
But you don't have to be.
I'm not even good about flying,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.280
so even getting there for me
is a challenge.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.960
Somebody said to me, once you go
into the jungle, you just get used

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.920
to flicking stuff off you
because stuff lands

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.560
on you all the time. Yes.
So you just get used to doing this.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.160
And I'm not sure... That's not good.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.600
No, I don't like
the uninvited guest.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.240
Very best of luck. Thank you.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.360
It's an absolutely sensational show,
it's going to be amazing.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.560
The girls are behind you, aren't
you, girls? I can feel the love

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.120
in the box, you'll be texting
like mad,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.920
going, "You're so funny tonight."

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.600
Thank you for doing this.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.040
Because you have to be quite brave
to hand over your phone.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.320
Or crazy. A big part of your life.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.320
Massive part of my life. I'm a bit
addicted to it. Yeah. I've realised.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.600
What about shopping, do you shop on
your phone a lot?

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.400
Yeah, I mean,
I keep Amazon afloat, I think.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.680
I mean, I've bought chicken stock
off Amazon.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.320
What about clothes? Oh, yeah, yes.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.200
Cos I'm just thinking
about my wife now.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.360
The other night...
You used to go shopping

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.840
when the shops were open. Yes.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.880
So you're restricted to that,
then you had to drive there and park

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.720
and browse and queue and stuff. Now,
my wife, she buys shoes in the bath,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.720
she buys it in the car,
on the way up a roller-coaster.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.000
She's just buying shoes.
The other night, I was lying in bed

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.760
on my laptop on internet banking,
she was lying next to me

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.680
on her mobile, I could see money
coming out of the account!

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.560
I was like, "Are you buy things
right now?"

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.640
Yeah. All right, I'm sorry you're
going to be without your phone

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.600
for not too long.
Yes, we can do this.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.400
It's going to be a whole lot of fun.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.680
If you would like to place
your mobile telephone...

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.800
Right, Niki, this is your job,
you've got to put it

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.400
in that little... Thanks, Niki.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.960
Pop it in there and then I will
bring the phone down.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.880
Thank you very much. Here we go.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.240
MUSIC: THEME FROM THIS MORNING

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.000
HE HUMS ALONG

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.160
I'm now in possession of
Holly Willoughby's mobile telephone!

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.160
Thank you, darling.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.520
Oh, my God, what have I done?
So, here we are.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.440
Oh, there we have it.
There it is, it's Holl's phone,

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.800
ladies and gentlemen!

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.960
Oh, there you go.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.400
Your girls are there for support,
that's right, Nicole.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.080
They're scared too!
Yes, you just help her out there.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.160
All right. Oh, Amazon - does this
show what you've been buying?

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.680
Oh, God.
How do you get to previous orders?

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.440
The three lines at the top.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.800
And then it says history.
Oh, do you mind?

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.480
Oh, yeah,
I bought some Halloween stuff.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.400
Halloween stuff.
Oh, stuff for the kids.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.880
Thinking Putty.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.840
Oh, you know why, cos it's
Christmas! Oh, no!

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.080
They're not Christmas presents! No!
They're Christmas presents. No!

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.880
What are the names of your children?

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.280
Harry, Belle and Chester.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.520
Chester, go to bed, go to bed now!

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.160
Brush your teeth.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.720
Go and play with your Thinking
Putty, which you don't have yet.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.080
LAUGHTER

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.400
All right. OK.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.400
Let's have a little look at your
photos before I put the text in.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.280
Oh, God. What's this, then?

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.120
Oh, that was the World Cup ball.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.800
That's the one they won with.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.240
A lot of people say that.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.840
No, that is.
LAUGHTER

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.920
Don't tell you me,
you got it from Amazon.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.360
LAUGHTER

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.240
What's this one? Oh.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.080
Oh, no, that's the picture
I was telling you about!

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.640
What is that?

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.720
What... What's going on here, Holl?

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.440
Oh, my God.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.560
LAUGHTER

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.480
This needs an explanation.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.200
So... Oh, God, it really does.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.200
So, this picture,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.720
my husband went
downstairs last night

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.480
to go and get some sweets

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.000
out of our kids' sweetie
cupboard drawer thing. Nice.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.800
We have a very lovely lady

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.560
that comes in and cleans sometimes,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.800
and she's emptied my handbag

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.640
and, in my handbag,

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.960
there was some sweets for the kids,

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.840
and also...possibly a tampon.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.200
LAUGHTER

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.480
And obviously, she's thought it
was something that looked like...

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.120
No, the yellow one. OK.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.280
LAUGHTER

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.920
She's obviously thought...

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.200
Is this one for Halloween?

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.200
LAUGHTER

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.400
So, yeah, my husband took a photo

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.360
and sent to me going "Darling,

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.640
"I'm not sure this should
be in the sweet cupboard."

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.520
LAUGHTER

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.120
All right. Well,
that is very awkward.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.840
Wow. Ah, that's Bluebell.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.000
That's your cat full of sweets...
or something else.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.880
OK.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.920
So, we're going to, I think,
pop the text into...

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.320
LAUGHTER

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.520
OK. Don't panic. "Don't panic"?

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.240
Are you joking?
Don't worry, don't worry.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.120
One of the things we all
love about you, Holl,

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.000
as you're surrounded
by your lovely girls,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.640
is that you're very down-to-earth,

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.640
girl-next-door, very modest,

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.080
you're just like us.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.760
You're certainly not
arrogant in any way.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.240
Oh... So, the text is,

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:03.200
"As you know, I am
a global style icon."

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.360
LAUGHTER

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.760
"This Morning are
doing a feature..."

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.000
That really could be about
anything, couldn't it, Holl?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.960
You've done features
on everything. We have.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.200
Have you ever done a feature
on this, though? Oh, God.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.520
"This Morning are doing a feature

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.480
"where I help people

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.640
"with absolutely no...

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.680
"..dress sense...

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.680
"..and I immediately...

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.440
"..thought of you."

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.240
LAUGHTER

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.960
APPLAUSE

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.440
I bet the girls are pleased they're
here and not receiving this text!

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.080
Oh, my God. You'll like this bit...

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.120
"What was...?"
I think I'll go capitals.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.080
"What WAS..." Oh, God, there's more?

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.200
"..that hideous thing...

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.600
"..you were wearing
last time I saw you?"

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.040
LAUGHTER

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.680
Oh, you know what we're
going to do here, Holl?

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.360
I think we might
involve some emojis.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.920
Oh, it's nice to see
your recently used...

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.640
Oh, when did the pukey one...?

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.080
When did you use that one?

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.360
Is that when you tried
one of your new sweets?

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.280
LAUGHTER

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.680
Oh, I do like that one.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.960
Do you think that's a good one?

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.280
Which one is that?

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.040
The face, that one. "Oh, my God."

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.040
Like, "Oh..." Yeah, I like that one.
"Oh, my God." That works quite well.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.920
"What WAS that hideous thing you
were wearing last time I saw you?"

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.760
Yeah, yeah. And I might throw
in some crying-laughing emojis.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.200
Yeah. Two of those?

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.720
Yeah, two of those.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.200
Oh, my God, I actually think,

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.440
now that I've seen it,

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.920
that that works quite
well, the puking one.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.960
I think that, on its own,
might be more effective.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.360
LAUGHTER

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.320
OK, "What WAS that hideous thing you
were wearing last time I saw you?"

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.480
Oh, my God! OK.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:06.040
New line. "Hope you
won't be offended...

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.160
"..but could you come in

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.440
"with a few of your outfits

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.600
"for Phil and I

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.840
"to laugh at?"
LAUGHTER

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.720
"In return..."

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.960
Here's the bait!

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.840
"..you'll get a whole new wardrobe!

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.680
"What do you say?"

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.480
OK. Oh, my God.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.480
Oh, I might throw a
"Need to know asap."

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.680
Holly, how would you sign a text?

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.840
I'd put, "Love Holly
kiss-kiss-kiss."

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.760
OK, it's good to
put some love in there.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.760
Well, it needs it.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.720
"OK, as you know,
I'm a global style icon.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.160
"This Morning are doing
a feature where I help people

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.680
"with absolutely no dress sense

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.120
"and I immediately thought of you.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.560
"What was that hideous
thing you were wearing

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.080
"last time I saw you?" Puking emoji.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.840
"Hope you won't be offended

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.000
"but could you come in
with a few of your outfits

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.320
"for Phil and I to laugh at?

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.960
"In return, you'll get
a whole new wardrobe,

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.480
"what do you say?
Need to know asap.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.120
"Love Holly," three kisses.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.120
Shall we send that to everyone
in Holly's phone? Oh, my God.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.640
All right, ladies and
gentlemen, that text has gone!

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.320
Yay!

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.680
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is time to find out

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:35.440
who has replied to Holly Willoughby
in tonight's Send To All!
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.800
How are you, girls? Hi!

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.600
So, here's a quick reminder
of the text that I sent in to

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.240
Holly's phone earlier.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.960
"As you know,
I'm a global style icon.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.840
"This Morning are doing a feature
where I help people with absolutely

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.040
"no dress sense,

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.080
"What was that hideous thing
you were wearing last time

"I saw you? Puking emoji.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.040
"Hope you won't be offended,
but could you come in

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.120
"with a few of your outfits

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.280
"In return, you'll get a whole new

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.760
"Need to know ASAP.
Love, Holly, xxx."

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.320
So that went out in your phone
not so long ago... Oh, God.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:21.000
..and there has been
a flood of texts.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.800
Really?

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.920
We shall start with...ha!
Jamie Oliver.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.200
LAUGHTER

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.800
It's good, it's a good one, it's a
good one, he's a good one.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.000
But I told him he had bad dress
sense. That's fine. He does.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.480
LAUGHTER

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.160
OK. "Hi, Holls.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.880
"I'm not going to pretend
your text didn't offend me,

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:54.080
"but to be honest, I'm so sick
and tired of my checked shirts."

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.160
Then he's put an emoji
of a checked shirt,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.560
which I don't even know existed.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.880
"I've been stuck in a real rut since
the Naked Chef. I deffo need help.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.440
"I'll bring them all in tomorrow.
I'm so up for a new wardrobe.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.000
"Love, Jamie." Aww! Jamie's in.
APPLAUSE

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.680
We'll do it. We can do that.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.080
Oh, oh, bless him.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.360
This is from Louis Walsh,
ladies and gentlemen. Oh, Louis!

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.320
Louis Walsh has texted,
"I'm Louis Walsh.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.800
"You must have the wrong number."
LAUGHTER

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.680
"My clothes are fab.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.240
"Philip is the one you need to
style."

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.680
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.400
Oh, he's another very stylish man.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.040
Mr Hook? Oh, my God!

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.720
That, that's my kids' headmaster.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.640
LAUGHTER

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.440
Mr Hook. Oh, God! Oh, my God!

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.440
That was the one, that's the one
I worried about the most.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.200
Mr Hook, the headmaster.
Is it quite a posh school?

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.440
It's a nice school. Is it, yeah?
I just hope they can still go there.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.840
OK.
LAUGHTER

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.600
He's gone with, "Yes, of course,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.880
"but I will probably be too busy
with pre-prep assembly." Oh!

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:18.320
"Are my suits really that bad?
Oh, no!
LAUGHTER

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.560
Oh, my God, no! Oh, no!

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.880
Quick text back. "Yes, see you
tomorrow." No! Don't do that!
LAUGHTER

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.640
Don't you dare, don't you dare!

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.080
Oh, my God.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.080
I'm so sorry, Mr Hook.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:36.320
Romesh Ranganathan. Oh, Romesh.
Oh, bless Romesh.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.680
Oh, it's a brilliant one.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.600
"If you're a global style icon,
I'm the world's most

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.160
"inspirational black woman."

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.080
LAUGHTER

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:57.480
And he's ended it with,
"Get stuffed. Love, Romesh."

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.440
Oh, sorry, Rom. Erm, who's Kez?

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.320
Oh, that's, that's
my husband's cousin.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.040
"Thanks, but no thanks."

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.520
Then he's put, "Don't watch morning
television. Who's Phil?"

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.800
LAUGHTER

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.280
Kelly, Kelly Hoppen.
She's not taken it well. Oh no!

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.960
It's very short. Oh no. She's just
gone, capital letters,

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.200
"NO. LOVE, KELLY."
LAUGHTER

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.800
Oh, she's a very stylish lady.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.480
Oh, my God!

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.520
OK. Oh, Philip Silver Fox.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.800
Oh!
CHEERING

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.360
Bless him. Oh, bless him.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.640
He's actually been quite rude to me.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:46.000
"As you're there, you could help
Michael McIntyre with his outfits."

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:52.280
"Those dark suits are looking a bit
thin and shiny these days."

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.120
Thanks, Phil!

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.280
Yeah, Philip would know, wouldn't
he, about the items you're doing.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.800
Yeah. On This Morning. Yeah,
he might have guessed that one.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.480
I get that.
Great one from Rylan Clark.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.520
"Two words - stop drinking."

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.200
Hannah Peckham.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.440
Oh, she's my old school friend.
Hannah Peckham?

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.880
Yes, we went to school together.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.240
"The last time I saw you
was my wedding day -

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.640
"bit harsh, Hol."

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.120
That's too good. You looked
beautiful on your wedding day.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.640
Oh, my God. How awful.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.840
"Bit harsh, Hol."

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.320
I think that has been an absolutely
sensational Send To All.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.280
And you've been amazing, they've
been hilarious responses. I know.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.720
Ladies and gentlemen,
the absolutely fantastic

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.840
Holly Willoughby, what about that?
