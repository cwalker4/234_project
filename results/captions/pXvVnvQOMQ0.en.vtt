&gt;&gt; Stephen: WE'RE BACK WITH
OUR FRIEND BILL MAHER.

00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:07.833 align:start position:0%
BILL, AS I SAID, TOMORROW
FRIDAY, YOU'VE GOT A SHOW LIVE.

00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:10.900 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I'M GLAD YOU REMINDED ME,
I'VE GOT TO LEAVE.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.900 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WE'LL WAIT A FEW
MORE MINUTES, PLEASE.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.233 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.

00:00:14.233 --> 00:00:16.533 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT ARE YOUR
THOUGHTS ON WHAT HAS HAPPENED

00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.233 align:start position:0%
LAST WEEK?

00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
IT WAS ONE OF SORT OF THE
SADDEST WEEKS ON MEMORY, GIVEN A

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.166 align:start position:0%
CHANGE, MANY SAD WEEKS WE'VE HAD
IN THIS COUNTRY AND ANNEED

00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:24.433 align:start position:0%
WORLD.

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:28.300
DO YOU HAVE ANY REFLECTIONS ON
WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK SPH.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.900 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; ON BOTH SIDES OF IT.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.433 align:start position:0%
I MEAN FIRST OF ALL, YOU KNOW,
I'M A BIT OF A CYNIC.

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:39.733 align:start position:0%
I THINK CIVILIZATION IS A MILE
WIDE AND AN INCH DEEP.

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.500
WITHOUT THE POLICE ON THE JOB,
YOU KNOW, THAT MOVIE THE PURGE,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.033 size:84% position:42%
IT WOULD BE THAT EVERY DAY.

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:45.466 align:start position:0%
WITHOUT THE POLICE.

00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I BELIEVE THAT
THERE SHOULD BE A SOCIAL ORDER

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.966 align:start position:0%
AND THERE SHOULD BE SOME
AUTHORITY.

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:52.700
AND WITHOUT IT, YOU KNOW SHALL
IT-- IN TWO DAYS WOULD YOU EAT

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.066 align:start position:0%
MY LIVER.

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:59.766 align:start position:0%
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; AND IT WOULDN'T BE GOOD FOR

00:00:59.766 --> 00:00:59.933 align:start position:0%
YOU.

00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:02.566 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY.

00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.966 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; SO OBVIOUSLY ANY TIME ANYBODY
SHOOTS A POLICEMAN, YOU KNOW,

00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
IT'S JUST ABHOR ANT.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.566
AND YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO ANDS,
IFS OR BUTS ABOUT T SO I DON'T

00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
CONDONE IT BUT I UNDERSTAND
TESTIMONY YOU CAN ONLY LOOK AT

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.833 align:start position:0%
SO MANY VIDEOS OF SHOOTING
UNARMED BLACK PEOPLE.

00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:22.633 align:start position:0%
I'M SURPRISED IT ACTUALLY DIDN'T
HAPPEN BEFORE.

00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:27.966 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HUH-UH HUH.

00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:29.900 align:start position:0%
AND SAID FAMOUSLY THAT THOSE WHO
MAKE PEACEFUL REVOLUTION

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.633 align:start position:0%
POSSIBLE MAKE VIOLENT REVOLUTION
INEVITABLE.

00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:36.933 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT, YEAH.

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:38.066 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND BLACK LIVES
MATTER MOVEMENT IS TRYING TO

00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:40.600 align:start position:0%
RAISE AWARENESS OF THE FACT THAT
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.066
LONG TIME AND IT COMES, IS PAID
ATTENTION TO AND THEN IT PASSES.

00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:47.166 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THIS GOES BACK TO, WELL,
CERTAINLY BEFORE.

00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:49.633 size:75% position:38%
BUT ON TAPE RODNEY KING.

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:52.466 size:84% position:42%
RODNEY KING WAS WHAT, 1991?

00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:53.433 size:78% position:39%
'92, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:57.066 size:88% position:44%
I MEAN WE ALL LOOKED AT THAT
TAPE AND WE THOUGHT HOW CAN

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:58.766
THESE COPS GET AWAY WITH THIS.

00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:02.600
YOU KNOW, NO MATTER WHAT RODNEY
KING DID, LEAD THEM ON A CHASE,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.800
THEY GOT HIM ON THE GROUND AND
THERE ARE SIX GUYS WHALING ON

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.333 align:start position:0%
HIM WITH A BATON AND SHOW THEY
GET OFF.

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:11.266 align:start position:0%
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG HERE
THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED.

00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:14.500 align:start position:0%
SO OBVIOUSLY VIOLENCE IS WRONG
ON BOTH SIDES.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.166
BUT YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN TALK
TALKING ABOUT POLICE CULTURE IN

00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:18.633
THIS COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME.

00:02:18.633 --> 00:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
LIKE I SAY, WE ALL NEED THE
POLICE.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.700
I THINK WE RESPECT THEM BUT
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
POLICE CULTURE.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.200
AND I DON'T THINK MOST POLICEMAN
ARE BAD PEOPLE OR WOULD DO THE

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.333 size:88% position:44%
THINGS WE SEE ON TAPE AM BUT
THERE IS THAT THIN BLUE LINE

00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:34.733 align:start position:0%
MENTALITY WHERE THEY PROTECT
THEIR OWN.

00:02:34.733 --> 00:02:35.533 align:start position:0%
AND I THINK THAT-- .

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:37.733 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU THINK IT'S
DIFFERENT NOW, DO YOU THINK IT'S

00:02:37.733 --> 00:02:40.533
WORSE THAN IT USED TO BE OR DO
YOU THINK THAT WE JUST GET TO

00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:42.733 align:start position:0%
SEE SOME OF THE ABUSES OF
AUTHORITY NOW.

00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:43.700 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S TRUE TOO.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.600 align:start position:0%
WE SEE IT MORE.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.133 align:start position:0%
I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK IT'S ANY
BETTER.

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:48.733 align:start position:0%
I THINK WE JUST SEE IT.

00:02:48.733 --> 00:02:53.333 align:start position:0%
AND I THINK THE POLICE KIND OF
LIKE THE PRIESTHOOD, THEY

00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:57.133 align:start position:0%
ATTRACT THE WRONG KIND OF PEOPLE
SOMETIMES.

00:02:57.133 --> 00:02:57.333 align:start position:0%
SORRY.

00:02:57.333 --> 00:02:58.400
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.866 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; BUT IT'S KIND OF TRUE.

00:02:59.866 --> 00:03:04.266
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO GO INTO POLICE WORK BECAUSE

00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:08.666
THEY WERE THE PERSON WHO WHEN
THEY WERE YOUNG, THEY HAD NO

00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:08.933 align:start position:0%
AUTHORITY.

00:03:08.933 --> 00:03:12.400
THEY WERE KIND OF LOSERS AND NOW
THEY WANT TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.233
LORD IT OVER PEOPLE, YOU KNOW.

00:03:14.233 --> 00:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT CANNOT BE
REVENGE FOR HIGH SCHOOL.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.133 align:start position:0%
AND WE HAVE TO-- .

00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:21.033 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU ARE THINKING
OF A FEW PEOPLE.

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:24.033 align:start position:0%
ARE YOU SORT OF PAINTING WITH A
BROAD BRUSH THERE?

00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:25.266 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WE DON'T KNOW.

00:03:25.266 --> 00:03:25.633 align:start position:0%
WE DON'T KNOW.

00:03:25.633 --> 00:03:28.600
BUT CERTAINLY, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH
VIDEOS TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.300
TOO MANY COPS WHO ACT LIKE THAT.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
I MEAN ANY IS TOO MANY.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.133 size:88% position:44%
AND YES, I DO THINK THAT'S A
TYPE OF PERSON WHO GOES INTO

00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:39.433 align:start position:0%
POLICE WORK.

00:03:39.433 --> 00:03:40.300 align:start position:0%
AND BY THE WAY, YOU CAN
ELIMINATE THAT.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.300 align:start position:0%
THERE ARE PSYCHOLOGY TESTS THAT
YOU CAN TAKE.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.900
WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE POLICEMEN.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.000
I THINK MOST POLICEMAN WANT TO
DO IT FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.833 align:start position:0%
I THINK MOST DO DO IT FOR THE
RIGHT REASONS.

00:03:48.833 --> 00:03:52.333
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT, YOU KNOW,
WHEN THEY SAY IT'S A DIFFICULT

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:53.800 size:84% position:42%
JOB, IT IS A DIFFICULT JOB.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.433 size:78% position:39%
THAT YOU VOLUNTEERED FOR.

00:03:55.433 --> 00:03:55.900 align:start position:0%
YOU KNOW.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
NO ONE IS CON SCRIPTED INTO
POLICE WORK.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.666 align:start position:0%
YOU WANTED TO DO IT.

00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
IT'S DANGEROUS, YES.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
BUT IT SAYS TO PROTECT AND SERVE
ON THIS SIDE OF THE CARD THAT

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.300 align:start position:0%
REFERS TO US, YOU ARE PROTECTING
AND SERVING.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.233 align:start position:0%
YOU'RE NOT THERE TO PROTECH
YOURSELF.

00:04:09.233 --> 00:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT DOESN'T
DIMINISH IN ANYWAY THE TRAGEDY

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.533 size:84% position:42%
OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK.

00:04:12.533 --> 00:04:13.466 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; DID I SAY IT DOES?

00:04:13.466 --> 00:04:16.733 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NO, BUT THE
IMPLICATION OF THAT WHEN I HEAR

00:04:16.733 --> 00:04:20.733
THAT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO EXPECT
THAT THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN

00:04:20.733 --> 00:04:21.133 align:start position:0%
SOMETIMES.

00:04:21.133 --> 00:04:22.966
&gt;&gt; NO, I DISN SAY THAT EITHER.

00:04:22.966 --> 00:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
I SAID I'M SURPRISED THAT IT
HASN'T HAPPENED BEFORE.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.200
YOU CANNOT SHOOT UNARMED PEOPLE
CONTINUE ALLLY WITHOUT SOMEONE

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.366 align:start position:0%
FIRING BACK.

00:04:31.366 --> 00:04:31.733 align:start position:0%
SORRY.

00:04:31.733 --> 00:04:32.966 size:81% position:41%
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.

00:04:32.966 --> 00:04:35.433 align:start position:0%
AND I HOPE IT GETS BETTER IN
THIS COUNTRY.

00:04:35.433 --> 00:04:36.266 align:start position:0%
IT SHOULD GET BETTER.

00:04:36.266 --> 00:04:39.066 align:start position:0%
AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY MORE
VIOLENCE.

00:04:39.066 --> 00:04:42.533 size:81% position:41%
BUT YES, I DO THINK POLICE
CULTURE HAS TO CHANGE TO A

00:04:42.533 --> 00:04:42.766 align:start position:0%
DEGREE.

00:04:42.766 --> 00:04:46.966
IT'S ONLY BEEN RECENTLY WHEN WE
SAW THESE HORRIFIC SHOOTINGS AND

00:04:46.966 --> 00:04:51.466
ONLY RECENTLY THAT THEY EVEN
SAID WELL, YOU KNOW, THIS WAS

00:04:51.466 --> 00:04:51.733 align:start position:0%
WRONG.

00:04:51.733 --> 00:04:55.100 align:start position:0%
BEFORE THAT IT WAS ALWAYS, THEY
WERE DOING IT BY THE BOOK.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.633 align:start position:0%
BY THE BOOK?

00:04:56.633 --> 00:05:00.566
WELL, MAYBE YOU NEED A NEW BOOK.

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:09.500 align:start position:0%
(APPLAUSE).

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THERE IS SOME
SENSE OF-- WITHIN THE FUNNY PART

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.300 align:start position:0%
OF THE SHOW IS OVER.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.933 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THIS IS ALL BEING
EDITED OUT.

00:05:15.933 --> 00:05:21.066 align:start position:0%
NONE OF THIS IS GOING TO MAKE IT
TO AIR, BILL.

00:05:21.066 --> 00:05:22.833
WE'RE GOING TO STICK WITH THE
POKEMON JOKES FOR ALL OF IT.

00:05:22.833 --> 00:05:26.833 size:88% position:44%
SO YOU KNOW, WE SAID EARLIER
THAT IT'S HAPPENING ON BOTH

00:05:26.833 --> 00:05:27.033 align:start position:0%
SIDES.

00:05:27.033 --> 00:05:29.900
DO YOU THINK THERE IS A WAY THAT
IT DOESN'T END UP BEING SIDES.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
THERE COULD BE A SESATION OF A
SENSE THAT THERE IS A SIDE.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.666 align:start position:0%
AND THAT YOU HAVE TO BE ON ONE
SIDE OR THE OTHER SIDE.

00:05:36.666 --> 00:05:41.300 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE I THINK THAT LEADS TO
ANOTHER ERA OF HOSTILITY.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.833 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT SHOULDN'T BE SUCH, BUT IT
DOES HAVE TO START WITH THE

00:05:45.833 --> 00:05:48.133 align:start position:0%
POLICE STOP SHOOTING UNARMED
BLACK PEOPLE.

00:05:48.133 --> 00:05:53.866
AND THE POLICE STOP BUILDING FOR
THE GUN-- STOP GOING FOR THE GUN

00:05:53.866 --> 00:05:54.166 align:start position:0%
IMMEDIATELY.

00:05:54.166 --> 00:05:55.433
AGAIN, IT IS A DANGEROUS JOB.

00:05:55.433 --> 00:05:58.566 align:start position:0%
I'M SORRY IT IS, BUT YOU
VOLUNTEERED FOR IT IT'S LIKE A

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:01.066
PROBING TOLL GUEST GETTING TO
THE OFFICE AND GOING OH MY GOD,

00:06:01.066 --> 00:06:07.833 align:start position:0%
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M LOOKING AT
[BLEEP] ALL DAY.

00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
(LAUGHTER)
WHEN YOU'RE A COP, YOU'RE GOING

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.066 align:start position:0%
TO BE LOOKING AT [BLEEP] ALL
DAY.

00:06:16.066 --> 00:06:18.333 align:start position:0%
THAT IS THE JOB YOU SIGNED UP
FOR.

00:06:18.333 --> 00:06:21.066
AND THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE A
LITTLE NERVOUS, YOU CAN'T JUST

00:06:21.066 --> 00:06:21.933 align:start position:0%
BAM BAM BAM.

00:06:21.933 --> 00:06:23.800 align:start position:0%
SO I DON'T GET HURT.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.133 align:start position:0%
AND AGAIN I DON'T THINK MOST
COPS DO THAT.

00:06:25.133 --> 00:06:27.633
&gt;&gt; Stephen: DO YOU THINK THEY
ARE TRAINED INTO THIS BEHAVIOR.

00:06:27.633 --> 00:06:29.933 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK THEY ARE
TRAINED ENOUGH OR WELL ENOUGH.

00:06:29.933 --> 00:06:30.466 align:start position:0%
I DON'T.

00:06:30.466 --> 00:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
I MEAN WE'VE SEEN POLICE
SHOOTINGS WHERE THEY FIRED LIKE

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.666
A LOT OF TIMES VERY CLOSE RANGE.

00:06:35.666 --> 00:06:41.166 size:88% position:44%
AND DIDN'T EVEN HIT THE GUY.

00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:41.766
SPEND SOME TIME AT THE RANGE.

00:06:41.766 --> 00:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OR BE A
STORMTROOPER.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
PLAF
(LAUGHTER)

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.633 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I THINK WHAT
HAPPENED IN THIS COUNTRY IS THAT

00:06:47.633 --> 00:06:52.066
IN THE LATE 60ST PEOPLE CALLED
THE COPS PIGS WHICH WAS VERY,

00:06:52.066 --> 00:06:52.966 align:start position:0%
VERY WRONG.

00:06:52.966 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
THAT WAS THE MENTALITY.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.933
AND EVER SINCE THEN, WE'VE KIND
OF BEEN TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR

00:06:57.933 --> 00:06:58.133 align:start position:0%
THAT.

00:06:58.133 --> 00:06:59.700
AND WE PUT THEM ON A PEDESTAL.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.566 size:75% position:38%
YOU KNOW, WE-- YOU CAN'T
CRITICIZE, YOU CAN'T SAY

00:07:03.566 --> 00:07:04.100 align:start position:0%
ANYTHING.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.266 align:start position:0%
THEY'RE ALWAYS HEROES.

00:07:05.266 --> 00:07:08.100
WELL, THEY OFTEN ARE HEROES BUT
THEY ARE ALSO HUMAN BEINGS WHO

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.466 align:start position:0%
ARE DOING A HUMAN JOB.

00:07:09.466 --> 00:07:11.666 align:start position:0%
AND AGAIN MOST OF THEM I THINK
LIKE THEIR JOB.

00:07:11.666 --> 00:07:17.066 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE YES, YOU SEE SOME OF THE
DISRESPECT.

00:07:17.066 --> 00:07:17.866 align:start position:0%
AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE
DISRESPECTED.

00:07:17.866 --> 00:07:19.100 align:start position:0%
BUT TO BE A COP IS ALSO HAS A
LOT OF PERKS.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.600 align:start position:0%
A LOT OF PEOPLE KISSING YOUR
ASS.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
A LOT OF FREE DONUTS.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.600
A LOT OF FREE STUFF, YOU KNOW.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:25.966 align:start position:0%
AND THAT'S FINE.

00:07:25.966 --> 00:07:27.266 align:start position:0%
BUT THAT'S THE JOB.

00:07:27.266 --> 00:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
AND I THINK MOST OF THEM WOULD
WANT TO KEEP DOING IT.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.400 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IT'S NOT A JOB
THAT I WOULD WANT TO DO.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.766 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T GO
INTO IT.

00:07:37.766 --> 00:07:39.833
AND THEY DON'T WANT YOUR JOB.

00:07:39.833 --> 00:07:41.633 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THEY MIGHT.

00:07:41.633 --> 00:07:42.233 align:start position:0%
IT'S A NICE JOB.

00:07:42.233 --> 00:07:44.166 align:start position:0%
I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULDN'T WANT
THIS JOB.

00:07:44.166 --> 00:07:45.466 align:start position:0%
IT'S A VERY NICE JOB.

00:07:45.466 --> 00:07:48.300 align:start position:0%

PAY ME A LOT OF MONEY.
