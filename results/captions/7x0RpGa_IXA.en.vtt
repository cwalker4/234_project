00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.460
The Hubble Space Telescope has been in space
for 28 years, producing some of the most beautiful

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.200
and scientifically important images of the
cosmos that humanity has ever taken.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.930
But let’s face it, Hubble is getting old,
and it probably won’t be with us for too

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.080
much longer.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.680
NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope is in
the final stages of testing, and WFIRST is

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.949
waiting in the wings.

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.550
You’ll be glad to know there are even more
space telescopes in the works, a set of four

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.289
powerful instruments in design right now,
which will be part of the next Decadal Survey,

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.620
and helping to answer the most fundamental
questions about the cosmos.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.050
I know, I know, the James Webb Space Telescope
hasn’t even reached space yet, and there

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.710
could still be more delays as it goes through
its current round of tests.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.039
At the time I’m recording this video, it’s
looking like May 2020, but come on, you know

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.089
there’ll be delays.

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.420
And then there’s WFIRST, the wide angle
infrared space telescope that’s actually

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.560
made of an old Hubble class telescope that
the National Reconnaissance Office didn’t

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.000
need any more.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.280
The White House wants to cancel it, Congress
saved it, and now NASA is getting parts of

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.640
it constructed.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.560
Assuming it doesn’t run into more delays,
we’re looking at a launch in the mid-2020s.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.250
I’ve actually done an episode about supertelescopes,
and talked about James Webb and WFIRST, so

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.179
if you want to learn more about those observatories,
check that out first.

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:40.369
Today we’re going to go further into the
future, to look at the next next generation

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:41.369
telescopes.

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.150
The ones that could be launched after the
telescope that gets launched after the telescope

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.329
that comes next.

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.659
Before I dig into these missions, I need to
talk about the Decadal Survey.

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.670
This is a report created by the US National
Academy of Sciences for Congress and NASA.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.380
It’s essentially a wishlist from scientists
to NASA, defining the biggest questions they

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.700
have in their field of science.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.619
This allows Congress to assign budgets and
NASA to develop mission ideas that will help

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.890
fulfill as many of these science goals as
possible.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.459
These surveys are done once every decade,
bringing together committees in Earth science,

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.060
planetary science, and astrophysics.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.030
They pitch ideas, argue, vote and eventually
agree on a set of recommendations which will

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.140
define science priorities over the next decade.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.939
We’re currently in the 2013-2022 Decadal
Survey period, so in just a few years, the

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:40.739
next survey will be due, and define the missions
from 2023-2032.

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:47.519
I know, that really sounds like the distant
future, but time’s actually running out

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:48.810
to get the band back together.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.950
If you’re interested, I’ll put a link
to the last Decadal Survey, it’s a fascinating

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.780
document and you’ll get a better sense of
how missions come together.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.599
We’re still a few years away from the final
document, but serious proposals are in the

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.810
planning stages for next generation space
telescopes, and they are awesome.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:08.811
Let’s talk about them.

00:03:08.811 --> 00:03:15.200
The first mission we’ll look at is HabEx,
or the Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.700
This is a spacecraft that will directly photograph
planets orbiting other stars.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.920
It’ll be targeting all kinds of planets,
from hot Jupiters to super Earths, but its

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.530
primary target will be to photograph Earth-like
exoplanets and measure their atmospheres.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:36.349
In other words, HabEx is going to try and
detect signals of life in planets orbiting

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.349
other stars.

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.040
In order to get this done, HabEx needs to
block the light from the star, so that much

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.659
fainter planets nearby can be revealed.

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.370
It’ll have one and maybe two ways to do
this.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.730
The first is using a coronagraph.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.930
This is a tiny dot that sits inside the telescope
itself, which is positioned in front of the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.530
star and blocks its light.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.560
The remaining light passing through the telescope
comes from fainter objects around the star

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.379
and can be imaged by the instrument’s sensor.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:12.299
The telescope has a special deformable mirror
that can be tweaked and tuned until the fainter

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:13.980
planets come into view.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.230
Here’s an example of a coronagraph in use,
on the European Southern Observatory’s Very

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.660
Large Telescope.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.350
The central star is hidden, revealing the
dimmer dust disk around it.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.910
Here’s a direct image of a brown dwarf orbiting
a star.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.950
And this is one of the most dramatic videos
I think I’ve ever seen, with 4 Jupiter-sized

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.410
worlds orbiting around the star HR 8799.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:43.130
It’s a bit of a trick, the researchers animated
the motion of the planets in between observations,

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.530
but still, wow.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.760
The second method of blocking the light will
be to use a Starshade.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.080
This is a completely separate spacecraft that
looks like a pinwheel.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.880
It flies tens of thousands of kilometers away
from the telescope, and when it’s positioned

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.070
perfectly, it blocks the light from the central
star, while allowing light from the planets

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.940
to leak around the edges.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.450
The trick with a Starshade is those petals,
which create a softer edge so the light waves

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.580
from the fainter planet is less bent.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.290
This creates a very dark shadow that should
have the best chance at revealing planets.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.540
Unlike most missions, Starshades like this
can be used with any observatory in space.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:27.080
So, Hubble, James Webb or any other observatory
could take advantage of this instrument.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.590
We’ve always complained about how we can
only see a fraction of the planets out there

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.190
using the transit or radial velocity method
because of how things line up.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:42.210
But with a mission like HabEx, planets can
be seen direction, in any configuration.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.470
In addition to this primary mission, HabEx
will also be used for a variety of astrophysics,

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.680
like observing the early Universe, and studying
the chemicals of the biggest stars before

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.830
and after they explode as supernovae.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.360
Next up, Lynx, which will be NASA’s next
generation X-ray telescope.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.550
Surprisingly, it’s not an acronym, it’s
just named after the animal.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.340
In various cultures Lynxes were thought to
have the supernatural ability to see the true

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.580
nature of things.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.880
X-rays are at the higher end of the electromagnetic
spectrum, and they’re blocked by the Earth’s

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.520
atmosphere, so you need a space telescope
to be able to see them.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:24.370
Right now, NASA has its Chandra X-ray Observatory,
and ESA is working on its ATHENA mission,

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.840
due for launch in 2028.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.880
Lynx will act as a partner to the James Webb
Space Telescope, peering out to the edge of

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.680
the observable Universe, revealing the first
generations of supermassive black holes, and

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.250
helping to chart their formation and mergers
over time.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.830
It’ll see radiation coming from the hot
gas from the early cosmic web, as the first

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.240
galaxies were coming together.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.330
And then it’ll be used to examine the kinds
of objects Chandra, XMM Newton and other X-ray

00:06:53.330 --> 00:07:01.110
observatories focus on: pulsars, galaxy collisions,
collapsars, supernovae, black holes, and more.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:06.330
Even normal stars can give off X-ray flares
that tell us more about them.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:11.800
The vast majority of the Universe’s matter
is located in clouds of gas as hot as a million

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.810
Kelvin.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:19.240
If you want to see the Universe as it truly
is, you want to look at it in X-rays.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.710
X-ray telescopes are different from visible
light observatories like Hubble.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.060
You can’t just have a mirror that bounces
X-rays.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:31.670
Instead, you use grazing-incidence mirrors
which can slightly redirect photons that hit

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.930
them, funneling them down to a detector.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:41.360
With a 3 meter outer mirror, the starting
part of the funnel, it’ll provide 50-100

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:47.430
times the sensitivity with 16 times the field
of view, gathering photons at 800 times the

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.280
speed of Chandra.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.860
I’m not sure what else to say.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.060
It’ll be a monster X-ray observatory.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.800
Trust me, astronomers think this is a very
good idea.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.000
Next, the Origins Space Telescope or OST.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.040
Like James Webb, and the Spitzer Space Telescope,
OST is going to be an infrared telescope,

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.670
designed to observe some of the coolest objects
in the Universe.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.490
But it’s going to be even bigger.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:18.900
While James Webb has a primary mirror 6.5
meters across, the OST mirror will be 9.1

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.760
meters across.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:26.940
Imagine a telescope almost as big as the largest
ground telescopes on Earth, but out in space.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:27.940
In space.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:32.240
It won’t just be big, it’ll be cold.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:38.329
NASA was able to cool down Spitzer to just
5 Kelvin - that’s 5 degrees above absolute

00:08:38.329 --> 00:08:42.159
zero, and just a little warmer than the background
temperature of the Universe.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:45.149
They’re planning to get Origins down to
4 Kelvin.

00:08:45.149 --> 00:08:49.690
It doesn’t sound like much, but it’s a
huge engineering challenge.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:53.389
Instead of just cooling the spacecraft with
liquid helium like they did with Spitzer,

00:08:53.389 --> 00:09:00.250
they’ll need to take the heat out in stages,
with reflectors, radiators, and finally a

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.149
cryocooler around the instruments themselves.

00:09:03.149 --> 00:09:08.410
With a huge, cold infrared telescope, Origins
will push beyond James Webb’s view of the

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:09.949
formation of the first galaxies.

00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:14.129
It’ll look to the era when the first stars
were forming, a time that astronomers call

00:09:14.129 --> 00:09:15.129
the Dark Ages.

00:09:15.129 --> 00:09:19.959
It’ll see the formation of planetary systems,
dust disks and directly observe the atmospheres

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:24.800
of other planets looking for biosignatures,
evidence of life out there.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.680
Three exciting missions, that’ll push our
knowledge of the Universe forward.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.089
But I’ve saved the biggest, most ambitious
telescope for last.

00:09:32.089 --> 00:09:36.250
And we’ll talk about that in a second, but
first I’d like to thank:

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.660
The Amazing Thunderchild
Bryan Alvarez

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.910
Grant Lanning
Thomas Wippich

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:43.319
Torben Frylund
Eric M

00:09:43.319 --> 00:09:47.680
And the rest of our 823 patrons for their
generous support.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.329
If you love what we’re doing and want to
get in on the action, head over to patreon.com/universetoday.

00:09:51.329 --> 00:10:00.040
All right, I’ve saved the best for last:
LUVOIR, or the Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.100
James Webb is going to be a powerful telescope,
but it’s an infrared instrument designed

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.069
to look at cooler objects in the Universe,
like red-shifted galaxies at the beginning

00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:11.379
of time, or newly forming planetary systems.

00:10:11.379 --> 00:10:15.420
The Origins Space Telescope will be a better
version of James Webb.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.040
LUVOIR will be the true successor to the Hubble
Space Telescope.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:25.209
It’ll be a huge instrument capable of seeing
in infrared, visible light and ultraviolet.

00:10:25.209 --> 00:10:27.819
There are two designs in the works.

00:10:27.819 --> 00:10:32.769
One which is 8-meters across and could launch
on a heavy-lift vehicle like the Falcon Heavy.

00:10:32.769 --> 00:10:37.879
And another design that would use the Space
Launch System that measures 15-meters across.

00:10:37.879 --> 00:10:42.629
That’s 50% bigger than the biggest Earth-based
telescope.

00:10:42.629 --> 00:10:45.170
Remember, Hubble is only 2.6 meters.

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:49.730
It’ll have a wide field of view and a suite
of filters and instruments that astronomers

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.060
can use to observe whatever they want.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.760
It’ll be equipped with a coronograph like
we talked about earlier, to directly observe

00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.830
planets and obscure their stars, a spectrograph
to figure out what chemicals are present in

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.620
exoplanet atmospheres, and more.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:08.370
LUVOIR will be a general purpose instrument,
which astronomers will use to make discoveries

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:13.740
across the fields of astrophysics and planetary
science.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.660
But some of its capabilities will include:
directly observing exoplanets and searching

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:24.209
for biosignatures, categorizing all the different
kinds of exoplanets out there, from hot Jupiters

00:11:24.209 --> 00:11:25.209
to super Earths.

00:11:25.209 --> 00:11:29.370
It’ll be able to observe objects within
the Solar System better than anything else

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:34.379
- if we don’t have a spacecraft there, LUVOIR
will be a pretty good view.

00:11:34.379 --> 00:11:39.110
For example, here’s a view of Enceladus
from Hubble, compared to the view from LUVOIR.

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:44.870
It will be able to look out anywhere in the
Universe, to see much smaller structures than

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:45.870
Hubble.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.709
It’ll see the first galaxies, first stars,
and help measure the concentrations of dark

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:52.680
matter across the Universe.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.839
Astronomers still don’t fully understand
what happens when stars gather enough mass

00:11:56.839 --> 00:11:58.019
to ignite.

00:11:58.019 --> 00:12:03.009
LUVOIR will look into star forming regions,
peer through the gas and dust and see the

00:12:03.009 --> 00:12:07.959
earliest moments of star formation as well
as the planets orbiting them.

00:12:07.959 --> 00:12:11.709
Have I got you totally and completely excited
about the future of astronomy?

00:12:11.709 --> 00:12:12.709
Good.

00:12:12.709 --> 00:12:14.199
But here’s comes the bad news.

00:12:14.199 --> 00:12:20.170
There’s almost no chance reality will match
this fantasy.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:24.499
Earlier this month NASA announced that mission
planners working on these space telescopes

00:12:24.499 --> 00:12:29.379
will need to limit their budgets to between
three and five billion dollars.

00:12:29.379 --> 00:12:33.740
Until now, planners didn’t have any guidelines,
they were to just design instruments that

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.439
could get the science done.

00:12:36.439 --> 00:12:40.680
Engineers had been working on mission plans
that could easily cross $5 billion for HabEx,

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:47.319
Lynx and OST, and were considering a much
larger $20 billion for LUVOIR.

00:12:47.319 --> 00:12:51.960
Even though Congress has been pushing for
surprisingly big budgets for NASA, the space

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.769
agency wants its planners to be conservative.

00:12:54.769 --> 00:13:00.540
And when you consider just how over budget
and late James Webb has become, it’s not

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:01.959
entirely surprising.

00:13:01.959 --> 00:13:07.769
James Webb was originally supposed to cost
between one and three point five billion dollars

00:13:07.769 --> 00:13:10.640
and launch between 2007 and 2011.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:16.740
Now it looks like 2020 for a launch, the costs
have broken past a Congress mandated $8.8

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.350
billion budget, and it’s clear there’s
still a lot of work to be done.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:26.529
In a recent shake test, engineers found washers
and screws that had shaken out of the telescope.

00:13:26.529 --> 00:13:28.990
This isn’t like an IKEA shelf with leftover
parts.

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:30.660
These pieces are important.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:36.819
Even though it’s been saved from the chopping
block, the WFIRST Telescope is estimated to

00:13:36.819 --> 00:13:40.029
be $3.9 billion, up from its original $2 billion
budget.

00:13:40.029 --> 00:13:45.600
One, two or maybe even all of these telescopes
will eventually get built.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:50.300
This is what the scientists think are most
important to make the next discoveries in

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:55.420
astronomy, but get ready for budget battles,
cost overruns and stretching timelines.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:59.040
We’ll know better when all the studies come
together in 2019.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:05.060
It would take some kind of engineering miracle
to have all four telescopes come together,

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:09.619
on time and on budget, to blast to space together
in 2035.

00:14:09.619 --> 00:14:11.329
I’ll keep you updated.

00:14:11.329 --> 00:14:13.050
What do you think?

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:15.339
Which of these telescopes is most exciting
to you?

00:14:15.339 --> 00:14:18.410
Let me know your thoughts in the comments.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:22.689
Once a week I gather up all my space news
into a single email newsletter and send it

00:14:22.689 --> 00:14:23.689
out.

00:14:23.689 --> 00:14:28.259
It’s got pictures, brief highlights about
the story, and links so you can find out more.

00:14:28.259 --> 00:14:31.170
Go to universetoday.com/newsletter to sign
up.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:36.019
All of my videos are also available in handy
audio and video podcast formats so you can

00:14:36.019 --> 00:14:39.949
have our latest episodes show up right on
your audio device.

00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:44.459
Go to universetoday.com/audio or universetoday.com/video
to get the one you want.

00:14:44.459 --> 00:14:47.009
And I’ll put the links in the shownotes.

00:14:47.009 --> 00:14:48.560
And finally, here’s a playlist.
