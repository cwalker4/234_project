00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.350
Hello this is Dr. Ford Brewer  - with
state-of-the-art preventive medicine,

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.230
heart attack,  cancer,  and stroke
prevention.  Today we're going to talk

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.900
about removal of plaque from artery
walls.   Everybody knows you can't do

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.670
that,  right ?    Well, that's not right! 
Actually I'm a poster boy for getting

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.109
plaque out of my artery walls.   I'm going
to show you my CIMT results from two

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:41.239
years ago.  As you see here that's my C
IMT.  It was done in February of 2015.  I

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.710
was 57.  I had a plaque here and a
discreet plaque there.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.789
Well, that wasn't good news.  If you look
at my arterial age, it was estimated at 73 (years old.)

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.940
Here are the normo- grams for the
(predictable amount of) thickness that you

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:09.869
expect to see for males and females.  And
there's mine.   So again, I was not a happy

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.110
camper!   That's an emotional event,
whenever a patient sees a plaque in

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:25.890
their arteries.   And for me that was a
surprise.   expected

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.280
to have crystal clean arteries.  I'd
always been the the poster boy for a

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.759
good heart attack and stroke lifestyle
nobody expected me to have that.  I

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.680
started off as an ER doc very early - in
my early 20s.  I got very frustrated

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.530
seeing too many early heart attacks.  I went
to Johns Hopkins to learn prevention.   I 
 loved it, did well, and

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.820
ended up running the program in
prevention.  I've taught a couple of the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.380
past presidents of the American College
of Preventive Medicine. (Or maybe I should say they taught me!)  So I know

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.729
prevention . And I've always basically
practiced it- good diet,  good lifestyle,

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.110
good exercise.  (I followed a) 
plant-based diet

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.870
all according to the standard
recommendations (at that time. The science keeps improving. )

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.519
Now what I'm getting ready to show you
is plaque -  so you can understand what

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:23.250
that is.  You can see that in a couple of
my other videos as well. To understand

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.060
plaque you need to understand the artery. 
There are two layers of the artery that

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.319
we need to look at :one is the intima (or endothelium)
layer;  the other is the media layer.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:41.280
Normally LDL ( the small dense LDL
particles) can go through this intima (or endotheliel

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.650
layer).  Then, when they do, they'll go
straight on through the media layer. But in

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.360
arteries that have inflammation, they
lose the ability to pass through this

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.610
media layer. That's research by the way
that's only just a couple of months old.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.459
It was done by a mentor and friend Brad
Bale along with Amy Doneen and David

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:09.260
Vigerust.  So what you're looking at here
in a  CIMT is the Carotid rtery

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.690
Intima Media Thickness test. So again
that's where you're going to get plaque

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:24.420
laid down.  Let's look at it in terms of
plaque progression.  This end of

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.609
the picture is a normal healthy artery
with very little plaque.  As you see it

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.079
progress,  you get more and more plaque. 
One of the things you may notice -  is that

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:45.230
the flow is not compromised until there
is a deep level of plaque.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.639
So that's why flow studies like
angiograms

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:57.530
and stress tests are way too late.  They
don't really look at doing any kind of

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.599
intervention (because their interventions are surgery focused).  They don't look at

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:13.590
that (surgery) until you get a 50%  occlusion ( occlusion means blockage of flow). As
you can see, with this kind

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.840
of plaque you still have very little
occlusion(or blockage of blood flow).  So we're saying:  Wait;  Move back

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.800
up here;  and Start thinking about the
determinants(the things that make your

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.560
plaques inflamed,  the things that cause
deposition

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:36.490
of plaque).  Here's a a couple of views from
patients that have heart attacks.  This is

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:42.940
the intima(endothelial) layer  - that narrow layer,  the
lining.  This is the media layer. So

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.630
everything in between those two is
plaque (mostly LDL - or "bad cholesterol" that has gotten stuck between the intimar &amp; media layers).  That's what they're

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:56.139
measuring.  With me they were measuring
the thickness and saying, "Look, even though

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.360
you're 57 years old you've
got enough plaque here to where you fit

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.330
the normo- gram (or the average) of a 73
year old.  This shows another thing - it

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.980
shows inflamed plaque.   What is inflammation
of plaque?  Inflammation of plaque is -

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.930
where your immune system attacks it (the LDL in the plaque between the intima &amp; media layers). 
White cells from our immune cells go in ( to the LDL in the plaque)

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.240
with antibodies.  They release enzymes. (These enzymes are meant to digest &amp; dissolve the plaque.)  We
can actually measure a couple of those

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:30.400
enzymes:  myeloperoxidase (also called MPO) and LP-PLA2 (also called "plack2") - all
in blood tests.   This is what causes the

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.190
heart attack  - not this.  This is a waxy, 
stable substance.  This is a liquid.  As

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.330
you see from here this is liquid.  (When they
dry this sample for the microscope - the liquid

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:47.260
retracted away from the from the slide.)
   You can also see there is very little

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:54.580
standing between the blood flow 
and that hot plaque!   Here's why

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.270
that's the problem:
hot liquid plaque -  when it touches blood

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:05.950
will cause a clot. It's not regular
plaque that causes the heart attack.  It's

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:14.020
the clot.  In well over 90 percent of the
cases,  the clot comes from

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:20.740
liquid plaque that has gotten out and
touched the blood.  That's exactly what

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:27.010
happened with this patient.  As you see, 
this is the intima layer.  And The media

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:34.150
layer's out here. This is plaque.  The
intima has a few cracks in it.  We

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.490
actually look at that (the intima - or endothelial layer) when we're looking
for MACR - (

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.130
Micro-Albumen/ Creatinine Ratio). 
That's one of our tests for inflammation. (This test - MACR is used by most internists. Although most know it's important, not as many know we're checking for holes in the intima. That's because the intima is the membrane filter of the kidneys - see other videos,)

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:46.530
I'll talk about that in another video. But you see here -  this "hot", or liquid plaque

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:53.190
has leaked into the bloodstream.  And this
is a clot.  The majority of this clot

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:58.830
broke off &amp; went up to the heart.  It  caused the 
heart attack and killed this patient!

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:05.490
(The fact that this clot is) down in here shows evidence
that the blood actually seeped through

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:13.260
the cracks in the in the intima and
formed the clot inside that area (inside

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.760
the wall as well.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:23.430
I'm still standing!  I
didn't have that happen.  But what did I

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:28.170
do about it?   Obviously there was not
a whole lot that I could do (or so I thought at the time I taped this video) for my

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:37.560
73 years
worth of plaque (deposition of LDL and my artery

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:48.780
wall) -  in terms of lifestyle because my
lifestyle was pretty good. (Or so I thought at the time).  Soon

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.020
that I began to realize that if I had
not had a good lifestyle I very well

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:57.030
could have had an event and all the bad
things that go along with having a

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:00.690
cardiovascular event now. (The reality is that I should I have focused more on my dietary high-glycemic carbs).  I did have
some other things and you might be

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:05.880
guessing genetics.  Yes,  I did I had some
genetic challenges.   I had (&amp; obviously still have) 9P21.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.530
The 9 stands for the number of the
chromosome.  I've got 23

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:19.350
chromosome pairs (like most humans). 
 Chromosome 9 has a
section on it called p21 which has a lot

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:24.600
of heart attack gene problems(called SNPs - or Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms. These are sort of like mutations. Except these are stable variations seen in a lot of the population.) In fact,  if
you look at Brad (Bale) &amp; Amy( Doneen's) book BEAT THE

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:30.120
HEART ATTACK GENE,  that's the one they're
talking about -9p21 I also have

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:37.890
4q25. That one (4q25 -  again on the fourth
chromosome) is really an atrial

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:45.980
fib risk gene.  My mother has atrial fib. I
have atrial fib.(Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac rhythm problem.) We have some

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.520
predisposition (genetic tendency) for that (atrial fib). (I also ran marathons on weekends. It has recently been found that prolonged, intense conditioning can also increase the risk for atrial fibrillation. In retrospect, that may not be a good idea for someone with 4Q25.)

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.810
it's not all just atrial fib, though. 
Current evidence is beginning to

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:57.260
indicate that it also has some risk (with 4q25)
associated with heart attack and stroke

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:04.250
as well.  Fortunately for me I had HAP 1,1.  Haptoglobin 1,1 .

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:11.390
I have a series on cardiovascular genetics.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:15.410
We can talk
about those later

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:22.640
What else did I have? ApoE 3,3 - so not a
lot of risk associated with ApoE 4.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:30.290
I didn't have that allele (or that ApoE4 gene).  I did
have high blood pressure.  And as I've

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:36.470
mentioned a couple of times before I had
insulin resistance. (I didn't know about my insulin resistance until it had already caused this plaque. If anyone should have known - it was me.) One of the major

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:44.120
associations with 9 p21, by the way,
is diabetes. (Another reason I should have  discovered my IR earlier.)  So that could I have a genetic

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.912
predisposition for both diabetes and
heart attack &amp; stroke.

00:09:45.912 --> 00:09:51.530
(Again, at that time, I followed standard practices in this area. Now, on fasting &amp; low carb diets, I'm keeping my blood sugar, insulin &amp; HgA1c at much better levels.)  So what did I do

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:55.310
I did do a couple of lifestyle things. I
did a little tune-up. I started eating

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:59.750
salmon everyday (more like 3 days/week now. I realize the salmon/mercury haters out there believe this is a problem) - to get omega
3s.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:10.090
I added niacin.  Niacin is a supplement
which improves HDL,  decreases LDL and

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:15.290
decreases triglycerides.  Niacin is an
over the counter you get up to about 2

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:20.560
grams daily. It is the only thing that we
have so far that has such a widespread

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:29.630
(or broad) effect on all our cholesterol values.
Was it the niacin?  I don't think - well, it

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:34.220
could have been - I think the niacin
helped. I don't think so (I don't think the niacin was the major change, but contributed.) There were

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:41.990
a couple of other medication
modifications I made. One was ramipril.  I

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.260
had high blood pressure
I was on an ARB (a related type of blood pressure medications).  I switched to an ACE

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:51.800
inhibitor. We've mentioned that before
we'll mention that again in other videos.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:57.470
ACE inhibitors, like statins, do more than
what they're prescribed for.   ACE

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.770
inhibitors are prescribed for high blood
pressure. They actually decrease

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:05.190
inflammation. Inflammation 
causes arteries to lay down

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:10.050
plaque. 
Likewise with statins. I think that's

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:15.120
where I made the biggest change. (I've made bigger changes since then by getting control of my previously unknown blood sugar problem.) I had
been avoiding (delaying, refusing) taking statins - like most

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.160
of my patients - because of the side
effects.      I went ahead and

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.040
"bit the bullet" and took the Crestor (rosuvastatin).  I took a
very low dose of Crestor - 5 milligrams.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.340
(Since getting better control of my blood glucose through dietary carb control, I have dropped the Crestor to 2.5 mg 2 times/week.)

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:32.340
I could take a lower dose. The lower
doses impact (decrease) inflammation.  They don't

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:39.120
impact (or cause) diabetes at the lower doses. And I think that's what made the

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:45.300
difference.  By the way what was the
difference?  A year ago my (plaque age) my

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:51.180
artery age was 59. A few months ago
my artery age was 52. (2 years ago my artery age was 73 - for a total drop of 21 years in about 2 years.)  A few weeks ago, it was 52 so you can't

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.120
reverse plaque,  right? I don't believe
that!  Thank you

00:11:54.180 --> 00:12:01.720
This sounds like my major focus is medications. It never was before. And it isn't now. Please understand my point. Research &amp; experience show that lifestyle is far more important. But sometimes - like when I was unknowingly building plaque with dietary carbs - meds can help.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.020
