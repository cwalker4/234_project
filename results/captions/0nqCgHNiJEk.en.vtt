00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:17.340
The way the light travels, some stars burn out long before they're ever seen by the human eye. The same can be said for dead planets.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.020
A day may come when people will look back through space and time to witness what they once were.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.160
Staring into the abyss...

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.860
...the abyss appears to return our gaze.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:19.540
As men tied to the Earth, we dream of visiting the stars.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:31.880
As men tied to the stars, we will dream of returning home.
