00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.990
HE WILL.

00:00:01.991 --> 00:00:03.792
WE TALKED TO TREY GOWDY ABOUT

00:00:03.793 --> 00:00:05.027
THAT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:00:05.028 --> 00:00:06.762
I DID SPEAK TO TREY GOWDY ABOUT

00:00:06.763 --> 00:00:09.231
FLYNN AND MICHAEL CULLEN.

00:00:09.232 --> 00:00:11.733
WATCH.

00:00:11.734 --> 00:00:13.935
&gt;&gt; SECURITY ADVISOR TO THE

00:00:13.936 --> 00:00:15.237
PRESIDENT, IT HAS NOW BEEN

00:00:15.238 --> 00:00:17.139
REVEALED BY HIM THAT WHEN HE WAS

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.774
INTERVIEWED BY THE FBI, WHO

00:00:18.775 --> 00:00:22.477
WANTED TO KNOW WHO WAS INVOLVED

00:00:22.478 --> 00:00:24.346
IN THE COLLUSION DURING THE

00:00:24.347 --> 00:00:26.248
CAMPAIGN OR THE TRANSITION WITH

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:27.349
RUSSIAN OFFICIALS, INFLUENCE IN

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.385
THE U.S. ELECTIONS.

00:00:30.386 --> 00:00:31.053
HE SAYS THAT ANDREW McCABE

00:00:31.054 --> 00:00:33.555
ADVISED HIM THAT HE DID NOT NEED

00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:35.090
AN ATTORNEY PRESENT DURING THAT

00:00:35.091 --> 00:00:35.457
INTERVIEW.

00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:39.428
AS WE KNOW, WHAT HE WILL BE

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:41.163
SENTENCED FOR HIS LYING TO THE

00:00:41.164 --> 00:00:42.998
FBI IN THAT MEETING.

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:44.566
WHAT YOU MAKE OF THAT?

00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:47.502
&gt;&gt; A STUNNING DEPARTURE FROM THE

00:00:47.503 --> 00:00:49.638
WAY THEY HANDLED ANOTHER

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:51.773
INVESTIGATION, AN EXAMINATION.

00:00:51.774 --> 00:00:53.842
THAT WAS WITH SECRETARY CLINTON,

00:00:53.843 --> 00:00:55.544
THEY HAD MULTIPLE LAWYERS WHO

00:00:55.545 --> 00:00:57.579
WERE ALSO FACT WITNESSES IN THE

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.580
ROOM.

00:00:58.581 --> 00:01:00.048
THERE WERE ALLEGATIONS THAT THEY

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.849
SUPPLY THE QUESTIONS TO

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.719
WITNESSES AHEAD OF TIME.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.420
THERE WAS A CLEAR INSINUATION

00:01:05.421 --> 00:01:09.524
THAT CERTAIN WITNESSES DID

00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:10.659
MISREPRESENTED MATERIAL FACTS TO

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.027
THE INVESTIGATORS, NO ONE WAS

00:01:12.028 --> 00:01:13.328
CHARGED WITH MAKING A FALSE

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:15.097
STATEMENTS.

00:01:15.098 --> 00:01:17.432
LOOK AT THE RUSSIAN

00:01:17.433 --> 00:01:18.133
INVESTIGATION, FLYNN, MICHAEL

00:01:18.134 --> 00:01:21.770
COHEN, I'M NOT MINIMIZING THAT.

00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:24.172
I PROSECUTE PEOPLE FOR IT TO.

00:01:24.173 --> 00:01:27.042
IF THAT IS ALL YOU HAVE, TO

00:01:27.043 --> 00:01:27.709
SERIOUS.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.778
IT SUGGEST THAT THERE IS NO

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:31.513
OTHER LARGER CRIME.

00:01:31.514 --> 00:01:32.314
NO ONE IN THE CLICKED

00:01:32.315 --> 00:01:33.915
INVESTIGATION WAS PROSECUTED FOR

00:01:33.916 --> 00:01:34.549
MAKING FALSE STATEMENTS.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.952
I JUST NAMED THREE.

00:01:36.953 --> 00:01:38.720
FOR HIM TO BE TOLD YOU DON'T

00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:41.389
HAVE A LAWYER PRESENT AND FOR

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.624
THEM TO ALLOW HER TO HAVE FACT

00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:46.027
WITNESSES WHO WERE LAWYERS, IT

00:01:46.028 --> 00:01:47.729
IS A STUNNING DICHOTOMY THAT

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.198
DOES NOT REFLECT WELL ON THE

00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:51.166
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

00:01:51.167 --> 00:01:53.435
&gt;&gt; Martha: MICHAEL: SENTENCED

00:01:53.436 --> 00:01:55.470
TO THREE YEARS, WHAT YOU MAKE OF

00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:55.770
THAT?

00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:58.940
&gt;&gt; IT IS ABOUT RIGHT.

00:01:58.941 --> 00:02:00.242
HE PROVIDED INFORMATION, THE

00:02:00.243 --> 00:02:00.309
OTHER

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.310
DISTRICT DID NOT VIEW THEM AS A

00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:03.378
COOPERATOR.

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:06.348
IT IS THE SAME PATTERN, MICHAEL:

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:07.315
SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO THOUGHT HE

00:02:07.316 --> 00:02:08.884
WAS A LIAR THE DAY BEFORE HE

00:02:08.885 --> 00:02:08.918
PLED

00:02:09.352 --> 00:02:09.485
GUILTY AND

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.386
THEN THEY THINK HE IS THE MOST

00:02:11.387 --> 00:02:12.754
IMPORTANT WITNESS IN THE WORLD

00:02:12.755 --> 00:02:13.522
THE DAY AFTER HE PLEADS GUILTY

00:02:13.523 --> 00:02:16.091
COME A JURY IS NOT GOING TO

00:02:16.092 --> 00:02:18.093
BELIEVE SOMEONE LIKE COHEN.

00:02:18.094 --> 00:02:20.962
IF YOUR CASE HINGES UPON THE

00:02:20.963 --> 00:02:21.730
CREDIBILITY OF COHEN, GOOD LUCK.

00:02:21.731 --> 00:02:25.567
&gt;&gt; Martha: IT SOUNDS LIKE IF

00:02:25.568 --> 00:02:27.169
YOU LOOK AT THESE MEMOS, AND THE

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.904
NEW INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE

00:02:28.905 --> 00:02:30.338
TODAY WITH REGARDS TO MICHAEL

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.639
FLYNN.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.708
MICHAEL COHEN.

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.311
WHAT IS YOUR OVERALL IMPRESSION

00:02:36.312 --> 00:02:42.884
OF

00:02:42.885 --> 00:02:43.919
&gt;&gt; I GO BACK TO WHAT WE WERE

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.921
ASKED TO DO, WHICH IS FIND OUT

00:02:45.922 --> 00:02:46.421
WHAT RUSSIA DID.

00:02:46.422 --> 00:02:49.124
UNTIL HE WRITES THAT DEFINITIVE

00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:50.992
REPORT, UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIM,

00:02:50.993 --> 00:02:51.826
NOBODY IS INTERESTED IN THAT

00:02:51.827 --> 00:02:53.862
PART OF HIS REPORT EXCEPT FOR

00:02:53.863 --> 00:02:56.932
MAYBE A HANDFUL OF US.

00:02:56.933 --> 00:03:01.136
IT IS STUNNING THAT PEOPLE ARE

00:03:01.137 --> 00:03:04.072
READING UNDER BLACK REDACTED

00:03:04.073 --> 00:03:04.773
LINES THAT THERE IS SOMETHING

00:03:04.774 --> 00:03:08.043
THAT IMPLICATES THE PRESIDENT OF

00:03:08.044 --> 00:03:08.944
THE UNITED STATES.

00:03:08.945 --> 00:03:09.578
THEY LOST INTEREST IN WHAT

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.546
RUSSIA DID.

00:03:11.547 --> 00:03:14.082
THE THROWAWAY WAS, BY THE WAY,

00:03:14.083 --> 00:03:15.250
IF THERE IS CRIMINALITY, WE WANT

00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:17.319
TO KNOW ABOUT THAT, TOO.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.954
I AM REALLY INTERESTED IN WHAT

00:03:18.955 --> 00:03:20.121
RUSSIA DID IN 2016.

00:03:20.122 --> 00:03:21.856
I'M ALSO INTERESTED IN THE

00:03:21.857 --> 00:03:22.591
CRIMINALITY, BUT WHAT I'VE SEEN

00:03:22.592 --> 00:03:26.461
SO FAR ARE FALSE STATEMENTS,

00:03:26.462 --> 00:03:28.463
BANK FRAUD, AND COMEY ADMITTED

00:03:28.464 --> 00:03:31.066
LAST FRIDAY, COLLUSION IS NOT A

00:03:31.067 --> 00:03:32.133
CRIME NO MATTER HOW BADLY CNN

00:03:32.134 --> 00:03:34.269
AND THE DEMOCRATS WANTED TO BE.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.672
COLLUSION IS NOT A CRIME.

00:03:37.673 --> 00:03:38.807
&gt;&gt; Martha: YOU HEARD FROM

00:03:38.808 --> 00:03:40.508
JAMES COMEY LAST WEEK, AND HE

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:42.143
WILL BE BACK ON DECEMBER 17TH.

00:03:42.144 --> 00:03:44.212
HE WAS VERY UPSET THAT THAT WAS

00:03:44.213 --> 00:03:45.880
NOT AN OPEN FORUM, AND WHEN HE

00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:47.482
CAME OUT AND TALK TO REPORTERS,

00:03:47.483 --> 00:03:48.316
HE SAID THAT.

00:03:48.317 --> 00:03:50.118
THERE IS NO REASON WHY THEY

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:52.120
SHOULDN'T BE AN OPEN FORUM.

00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:53.288
HE ALSO SAID, THE SUGGESTION

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:55.156
THAT THERE WAS A FISA ABUSE IN

00:03:55.157 --> 00:03:59.494
THE INITIAL STAGES OF THE

00:03:59.495 --> 00:04:00.795
INVESTIGATION INTO THE TRUMP

00:04:00.796 --> 00:04:02.264
CAMPAIGN AND ANY CONNECTION TO

00:04:02.265 --> 00:04:03.265
RUSSIA WAS RIDICULOUS.

00:04:03.266 --> 00:04:04.299
ABSURD, IS I THINK THE WORD THAT

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.103
HE USED.

00:04:08.104 --> 00:04:10.372
&gt;&gt; MARTHA, I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN

00:04:10.373 --> 00:04:11.439
WHAT HE DIDN'T REMEMBER BUT I

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.140
WAS MUCH MORE DISAPPOINTED IN

00:04:12.141 --> 00:04:17.312
WHICH HE    HE NEVER KNEW.

00:04:17.313 --> 00:04:20.115
THE HEAD OF THE FBI HAS THE

00:04:20.116 --> 00:04:21.449
CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT UNDER

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.651
INVESTIGATION, HE NEVER READ THE

00:04:22.652 --> 00:04:23.385
INITIATION DOCUMENT, DIDN'T KNOW

00:04:23.386 --> 00:04:25.920
THAT PETER STRZOK HAD SIGNED IT.

00:04:25.921 --> 00:04:26.888
HE STILL DOESN'T KNOW TO THIS

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.490
DAY THAT IT MADE REFERENCE TO

00:04:28.491 --> 00:04:29.224
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

00:04:29.225 --> 00:04:32.260
HE STILL THINKS IT IS FOUR

00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:32.661
INDIVIDUALS.

00:04:32.662 --> 00:04:34.429
DOESN'T KNOW WHO PETER STILL IS,

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.698
KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT EFFORTS TO

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:37.399
EITHER COOPERATE OR CONTRADICT

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.668
THE DOSSIER.

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.671
DOESN'T AGREE THAT THERE IS A

00:04:42.672 --> 00:04:43.338
DUTY TO PRODUCE EXCULPATORY

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.738
INFORMATION.

00:04:43.739 --> 00:04:46.641
I ASKED HIM, WHEN DID YOU LEARN

00:04:46.642 --> 00:04:49.044
THAT THE DNC WAS FUNDING THE

00:04:49.045 --> 00:04:50.679
RESEARCH INTO TRUMP, HE SAID,

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.513
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

00:04:51.514 --> 00:04:53.448
AS IF IT DOESN'T MATTER.

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:54.582
IF YOU'RE NOT TELLING A JUDGE,

00:04:54.583 --> 00:04:58.086
DON'T YOU THINK IT IS RELEVANT,

00:04:58.087 --> 00:04:59.721
HEY, MY POLITICAL ENEMIES ARE

00:04:59.722 --> 00:05:00.889
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE THIRD OF

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.257
WHAT I AM GIVING YOU.

00:05:02.258 --> 00:05:04.059
A JUDGE WANTS TO KNOW THAT.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.860
COMEY IS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE

00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:07.696
EVER SEEN AT ALWAYS BEING RIGHT

00:05:07.697 --> 00:05:09.564
IN HIS MIND, AND IT DOESN'T

00:05:09.565 --> 00:05:12.534
MATTER IF HE IS A UNIVERSE OF

00:05:12.535 --> 00:05:12.867
ONE.

00:05:12.868 --> 00:05:15.403
IF YOU WRITE A BOOK ABOUT ETHICS

00:05:15.404 --> 00:05:18.073
AND MORALITY, THAT IN AND OF

00:05:18.074 --> 00:05:20.775
ITSELF IS A FAIRLY HIGH OPINION

00:05:20.776 --> 00:05:22.477
OF YOURSELVES THING TO DO.

00:05:22.478 --> 00:05:23.945
COMEY JUST THINKS HE'S ALWAYS

00:05:23.946 --> 00:05:27.916
RIGHT, AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF

00:05:27.917 --> 00:05:28.750
EVERYONE ELSE CONCLUDE HE DID

00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:29.050
WRONG.

00:05:29.051 --> 00:05:30.452
HE KNOWS BETTER.

00:05:30.453 --> 00:05:33.321
THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE TO

00:05:33.322 --> 00:05:35.390
INTERVIEW AN AMNESIAC WITH

00:05:35.391 --> 00:05:37.492
INCREDIBLE HUBRIS.

00:05:37.493 --> 00:05:38.193
&gt;&gt; Martha: DO YOU BELIEVE THAT

00:05:38.194 --> 00:05:42.764
HE FUNCTIONED AS A POLITICAL FBI

00:05:42.765 --> 00:05:43.131
DIRECTOR?

00:05:43.132 --> 00:05:46.468
&gt;&gt; I THINK JIM COMEY WAS

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:47.469
PRIMARILY MOTIVATED BY A DESIRE

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.805
TO PROTECT THE BRAND OF JIM

00:05:50.806 --> 00:05:51.106
COMEY.

00:05:51.107 --> 00:05:55.076
I DEFENDED HIM IN 2016, EVEN

00:05:55.077 --> 00:05:58.313
WHEN IT WAS LONELY TO DO SO.

00:05:58.314 --> 00:05:59.047
I WOULD STILL DEFEND HIM TODAY

00:05:59.048 --> 00:06:02.350
IF I THOUGHT HE WAS MAKING THE

00:06:02.351 --> 00:06:03.418
RIGHT DECISION, BUT HE HAS BEEN

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:08.456
SO OVERTLY PARTISAN SINCE HE

00:06:08.457 --> 00:06:09.991
LEFT, NOT JUST AS PRESIDENT, BUT

00:06:09.992 --> 00:06:11.326
HE WANTS PEOPLE TO VOTE

00:06:11.327 --> 00:06:16.865
DEMOCRAT, HE WANTS A DEMOCRAT

00:06:16.866 --> 00:06:17.699
HOUSE.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.666
HE IS VERY FLUNKY.

00:06:18.667 --> 00:06:20.268
HE SAID IN THIS ROOM WHERE WE

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:22.437
ARE RIGHT NOW, THE PRESIDENT

00:06:22.438 --> 00:06:24.806
DOESN'T GIVE A HOOT ABOUT

00:06:24.807 --> 00:06:25.173
POLITICS.

00:06:25.174 --> 00:06:27.509
AND McCABE, THAT IS WHO WAS

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:28.109
RUNNING THESE TWO MAJOR

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.710
INVESTIGATIONS.

00:06:28.711 --> 00:06:30.578
AND HE WANTS US TO BELIEVE THEY

00:06:30.579 --> 00:06:32.113
DON'T CARE ABOUT POLITICS.

00:06:32.114 --> 00:06:33.481
GO READ THE TEXT FOR YOURSELF.

00:06:33.482 --> 00:06:34.516
GO READ COMEY'S TWITTER FEED AND

00:06:34.517 --> 00:06:37.051
SEE IF HE CARES ABOUT POLITICS.

00:06:37.052 --> 00:06:38.653
&gt;&gt; Martha: WHAT DID YOU THINK

00:06:38.654 --> 00:06:39.254
ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP?

00:06:39.255 --> 00:06:41.156
YOU MET HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME

00:06:41.157 --> 00:06:41.523
THIS WEEK.

00:06:41.524 --> 00:06:44.692
&gt;&gt; YES, MA'AM, .

00:06:44.693 --> 00:06:45.360
NUMBER ONE, APPRECIATE HIM

00:06:45.361 --> 00:06:45.827
LETTING ME COME.

00:06:45.828 --> 00:06:50.298
I WANTED TO ADVOCATE FOR JOHN

00:06:50.299 --> 00:06:51.566
RADCLIFFE FOR AG, AND HE HAD

00:06:51.567 --> 00:06:52.667
ALREADY MADE THE PAY, BUT HE WAS

00:06:52.668 --> 00:06:54.035
KIND ENOUGH TO LET ME COME

00:06:54.036 --> 00:06:54.369
ANYWAY.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.706
A WIDE-RANGING CONVERSATION FROM

00:06:58.707 --> 00:07:01.476
LIFE AND KAVANAUGH, TO AN

00:07:01.477 --> 00:07:02.243
OPINION THAT CAME OUT

00:07:02.244 --> 00:07:04.846
YESTERDAY -- NOT AN OPINION, BUT

00:07:04.847 --> 00:07:05.880
THE DENIAL OF SERVICE.

00:07:05.881 --> 00:07:06.181
GOLF.

00:07:06.182 --> 00:07:07.949
&gt;&gt; Martha: WHAT DID HE SAY

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.918
ABOUT THAT?

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:11.486
&gt;&gt; MY OPINION, WHICH I SAID A

00:07:11.487 --> 00:07:12.220
LOT, HE SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK

00:07:12.221 --> 00:07:14.722
ABOUT IT?

00:07:14.723 --> 00:07:18.426
MY SENSE IS THAT KAVANAUGH DID

00:07:18.427 --> 00:07:23.264
NOT THINK THAT WAS THE RIGHT

00:07:23.265 --> 00:07:24.566
FACTS TO HAVE ANOTHER HEARING ON

00:07:24.567 --> 00:07:26.501
AN ABORTION RELATED CASE.

00:07:26.502 --> 00:07:28.203
IN THE VICTIM ACTUALLY BECAME

00:07:28.204 --> 00:07:30.305
PREGNANT AS A RESULT OF A RATE,

00:07:30.306 --> 00:07:31.039
SO WE TALKED ABOUT EXCEPTIONS

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.675
AND WHETHER OR NOT I BELIEVE INT

00:07:33.676 --> 00:07:33.708
AND WHETHER OR NOT I BELIEVE INE

00:07:33.709 --> 00:07:33.775
AND WHETHER OR NOT I BELIEVE IN,

00:07:33.776 --> 00:07:33.808
AND WHETHER OR NOT I BELIEVE INW

00:07:33.809 --> 00:07:34.042
AND WHETHER OR NOT I BELIEVE INE

00:07:34.043 --> 00:07:34.075
AND WHETHER OR NOT I BELIEVE INT

00:07:34.076 --> 00:07:34.108
AND WHETHER OR NOT I BELIEVE INL

00:07:34.109 --> 00:07:34.142
AND WHETHER OR NOT I BELIEVE INE

00:07:34.143 --> 00:07:34.442
AND WHETHER OR NOT I BELIEVE IND

00:07:34.443 --> 00:07:34.476
AND WHETHER OR NOT I BELIEVE INA

00:07:34.477 --> 00:07:34.509
AND WHETHER OR NOT I BELIEVE INO

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.909
AND WHETHER OR NOT I BELIEVE INT

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:34.943
AND WHETHER OR NOT I BELIEVE INC

00:07:34.944 --> 00:07:34.976
AND WHETHER OR NOT I BELIEVE INI

00:07:34.977 --> 00:07:35.210
AND WHETHER OR NOT I BELIEVE INF

00:07:35.211 --> 00:07:38.680
OF STAFF, WE TALKED ABOUT AG, HE

00:07:38.681 --> 00:07:41.616
GOT LINDSAY ON THE PHONE AT ONE

00:07:41.617 --> 00:07:42.884
ONE POINT.

00:07:42.885 --> 00:07:43.485
IT WAS A FASCINATING --

00:07:43.486 --> 00:07:45.086
&gt;&gt; Martha: THAT HE HAVE A

00:07:45.087 --> 00:07:46.888
CHIEF OF STAFF IN MINDED THAT HE

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:47.589
SEEMED TO BE LEANING TOWARDS?

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.057
&gt;&gt; IF HE DID, HE DIDN'T SHARE

00:07:49.058 --> 00:07:50.892
WITH ME.

00:07:50.893 --> 00:07:52.694
&gt;&gt; Martha: AS YOU LEAVE AND WE

00:07:52.695 --> 00:07:54.963
SEE THE NEW CONGRESS COMING IN,

00:07:54.964 --> 00:07:55.697
MAJORITY DEMOCRATS ON THE HOUSE

00:07:55.698 --> 00:07:58.466
SIDE, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT THEY

00:07:58.467 --> 00:08:00.502
WILL PURSUE IN TERMS OF

00:08:00.503 --> 00:08:01.202
OVERSIGHT, GIVEN THE LANDSCAPE

00:08:01.203 --> 00:08:01.569
RIGHT NOW?

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.339
&gt;&gt; EVERYTHING.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.340
EVERYTHING THAT THEIR BASE WANTS

00:08:05.341 --> 00:08:06.574
THEM TO PURSUE.

00:08:06.575 --> 00:08:12.480
EVERYTHING THAT IS CALCULATED TO

00:08:12.481 --> 00:08:13.915
DISRUPT THE LAST TWO YEARS OF

00:08:13.916 --> 00:08:19.187
TRUMP'S TENURE IN OFFICE, AND

00:08:19.188 --> 00:08:21.289
IT'S -- THEY MAY BE SMART ENOUGH

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.490
NOT TO PURSUE IMPEACHMENT,

00:08:22.491 --> 00:08:23.892
ALTHOUGH SOME OF THEM OR NOT.

00:08:23.893 --> 00:08:25.026
60 OF THEM HAVE ALREADY SAID HE

00:08:25.027 --> 00:08:27.495
SHOULD BE IMPEACHED AND HAVEN'T

00:08:27.496 --> 00:08:28.296
ISSUED A SINGLE FINDING YET, SO

00:08:28.297 --> 00:08:31.366
IT WILL BE VERY, VERY DIFFICULT

00:08:31.367 --> 00:08:32.033
FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION, AND

00:08:32.034 --> 00:08:33.801
THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DECIDE

00:08:33.802 --> 00:08:37.305
HOW THEY WILL HANDLE SUBPOENAS

00:08:37.306 --> 00:08:38.339
AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.742
IT WILL BE BITTERLY IRONIC FOR

00:08:40.743 --> 00:08:43.645
ME TO LISTEN TO DEMOCRATS CLAMOR

00:08:43.646 --> 00:08:47.849
FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO BE

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:48.583
RESPONSIVE WHEN THEY DIDN'T SAY

00:08:48.584 --> 00:08:50.985
A WORD TO SEE IF WE WERE TRYING

00:08:50.986 --> 00:08:52.153
TO GET INFORMATION FROM THE

00:08:52.154 --> 00:08:52.720
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.

00:08:52.721 --> 00:08:53.855
&gt;&gt; Martha: WHAT DID YOU THINK

00:08:53.856 --> 00:08:56.090
OF THE SCENE IN THE OVAL OFFICE

00:08:56.091 --> 00:08:57.492
YESTERDAY WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP

00:08:57.493 --> 00:08:58.526
WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW HE WANTS

00:08:58.527 --> 00:08:59.294
TO BUILD A WALL?

00:08:59.295 --> 00:09:01.129
HE SAID, I WOULD BE PROUD TO

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.530
SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT OVER

00:09:02.531 --> 00:09:03.665
THE ISSUE OF BORDER SECURITY.

00:09:03.666 --> 00:09:06.234
IT MEANS THAT MUCH TO ME.

00:09:06.235 --> 00:09:07.135
AND NANCY PELOSI AND

00:09:07.136 --> 00:09:07.869
CHUCK SCHUMER VERY MUCH WANTED

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:11.105
TO TAKE THE CONVERSATION

00:09:11.106 --> 00:09:13.041
PRIVATE, DIDN'T WANT IT TO    TO

00:09:13.042 --> 00:09:13.374
PRIVATE, DIDN'T WANT IT TO    TA

00:09:13.375 --> 00:09:15.944
DEBATE IN FRONT OF THE PUBLIC.

00:09:15.945 --> 00:09:18.279
&gt;&gt; FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.714
TRANSPARENCY, WELL, THERE IT IS.

00:09:19.715 --> 00:09:21.115
I'M WASN'T SURE IF I WAS

00:09:21.116 --> 00:09:23.217
WATCHING FOX OR PROFESSIONAL

00:09:23.218 --> 00:09:25.987
WRESTLING.

00:09:25.988 --> 00:09:27.055
I'VE SEEN THOSE CONVERSATIONS

00:09:27.056 --> 00:09:27.956
BACK IN JUDGE BROWSER-BASED

00:09:27.957 --> 00:09:29.591
CHAMBERS, I'VE SEEN THEM WHERE

00:09:29.592 --> 00:09:30.158
THERE ARE NO CAMERAS.

00:09:30.159 --> 00:09:33.595
I'VE NEVER SEEN IT LIKE THAT.

00:09:33.596 --> 00:09:36.264
IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT

00:09:36.265 --> 00:09:36.965
NANCY PELOSI DID NOT WANT TO

00:09:36.966 --> 00:09:39.534
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION IN

00:09:39.535 --> 00:09:41.636
PUBLIC, BUT IF YOU ARE

00:09:41.637 --> 00:09:45.473
INTERESTED IN A FRAMING THE

00:09:45.474 --> 00:09:46.841
ISSUES, THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES

00:09:46.842 --> 00:09:48.276
THAT THE WALL IS INEXTRICABLY

00:09:48.277 --> 00:09:49.310
INTERTWINED WITH BORDER

00:09:49.311 --> 00:09:50.044
SECURITY, AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE

00:09:50.045 --> 00:09:52.480
TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU THAT THEY

00:09:52.481 --> 00:09:53.247
BELIEVE IN BORDER SECURITY, BUT

00:09:53.248 --> 00:09:56.684
NOT A WALL.

00:09:56.685 --> 00:09:57.852
WHAT I WOULD LOVE FOR THE

00:09:57.853 --> 00:09:59.287
PRESIDENT TO ASK YESTERDAY, AT

00:09:59.288 --> 00:10:00.822
ONE POINT, YOU VOTED FOR THE

00:10:00.823 --> 00:10:01.289
WALL.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:01.856
WHAT CHANGED?

00:10:01.857 --> 00:10:03.124
WHY WAS IT A GOOD IDEA FIVE

00:10:03.125 --> 00:10:06.461
YEARS AGO, BUT NOW IT IS

00:10:06.462 --> 00:10:10.632
XENOPHOBIC AND RACIST AND NOT

00:10:10.633 --> 00:10:11.265
REFLECTIVE OF OUR VALUES?

00:10:11.266 --> 00:10:13.501
WHAT, OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT I

00:10:13.502 --> 00:10:14.936
CHAMPIONED THE IDEA, WHAT HAS

00:10:14.937 --> 00:10:15.269
CHANGED?

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.471
&gt;&gt; Martha: DID YOU THINK IT

00:10:16.472 --> 00:10:18.139
WAS A POLITICAL MISTAKE FOR HIM

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.440
TO SAY "I WILL OWN THAT SHUT

00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:19.907
DOWN.

00:10:19.908 --> 00:10:21.009
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT, I AM

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.378
HAPPY TO OWN IT."

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:27.215
&gt;&gt; I THINK THERE WAS A PRETTY

00:10:27.216 --> 00:10:29.317
GOOD CHANCE THEY WOULD CALL IT

00:10:29.318 --> 00:10:33.621
SHUTDOWN NO MATTER WHAT HE SAID.

00:10:33.622 --> 00:10:35.857
THAT IS A PRETTY GOOD COUNTER

00:10:35.858 --> 00:10:36.891
TALKING POINT.

00:10:36.892 --> 00:10:39.227
WE GAVE YOU 1.6, WHAT HAVE YOU

00:10:39.228 --> 00:10:44.967
DONE WITH THAT.
