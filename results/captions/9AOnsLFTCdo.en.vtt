00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.171
The 3 Angel’s Message, God’s final warning
to the world declare “…Fear God, and give

00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:16.200
glory to him; for the hour of his judgment
is come…”. We are living in earth’s final judgment hour – stay tuned!

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.410
Hi, this is Dustin with Hope Through Prophecy.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.060
in!
Our study today takes us back to that apocalyptic

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.490
book of Daniel – a book with special significance
for the end times. Daniel was written in the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.660
6th century BC, long before the events described
in this prophecy.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.930
In chapter 8, Daniel receives a prophetic
vision in which a goat charges towards a ram,

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.780
collides with it, and overpowers it. It is
later revealed that this ram represents the

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.960
kingdom of Medo-Persia, while the goat embodies
Greece, the nation that would conquer Medo-Persia.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.579
This event is then followed by the rise of
a little horn, which we will cover in a future

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.720
video. This dreaded little horn power would
gain great influence, persecute God’s people,

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.689
and defile God’s sanctuary.
“How long would this continue?” “How

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.410
long would God’s people and His sanctuary
be trampled on?

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.971
The answer is given by the Angel Gabriel in
Daniel 8:14: “And he said unto me, Unto

00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:22.879
two thousand and three hundred days; then
shall the sanctuary be cleansed.”

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:28.180
This “cleansing of the sanctuary” is related
to an event that took place in the sanctuary

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.190
service – a system that God gave to His
people to help then understand His plan of

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.550
salvation. Throughout the year, the people
confessed their sins, and these sins were

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.670
symbolically transferred into the sanctuary
through the blood shed by lambs, which represented

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.959
the coming Messiah. Once per year, on the
day of atonement, also known as the day of

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:58.310
judgment, the high priest would enter into
the most Holy Place of the sanctuary, bringing

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:05.160
the blood of the Lord’s goat, and interceding
between God and the people. This yearly service

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.800
would symbolically cleanse the earthly sanctuary
from all of the sins which had been accumulating

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.410
throughout the year. We will discuss more
of this event, and it’s significance, in

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.099
a future video.
However, this cleansing of the sanctuary described

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:28.730
in Daniel 8:14 could not be referring to the
earthly sanctuary; For the earthly sanctuary

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.640
was to be cleansed once per year, and this
passage in Daniel is describing a cleansing

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.840
that would happen many years in the future.
In fact, Daniel 8 reveals to us that this

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.980
cleansing of the sanctuary, or judgment day,
would take place during the end times:

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.460
…for at the time of the end shall be the
vision.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:57.270
So, what sanctuary could it be referring to?
The book of Hebrews speaks of another sanctuary!

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:04.370
In fact, it speaks of God’s true sanctuary,
which is located in Heaven itself! Hebrews

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.330
8:2 refers to it as
“…the sanctuary, and…true tabernacle,

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.879
which the Lord pitched, and not man.”
So, we can see that Daniel 8:14 refers to

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:23.730
a cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary, a judgment
day, which would take place in the end times.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.360
However, Gabriel does not yet explain the
precise timing of the vision - when it would

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.740
begin, and when it would end. Because of this
confusion over the timing of the vision, chapter

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.419
8 ends will Daniel fainting and getting sick,
saying “I was astonished at the vision,

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:48.360
but none understood it.”
Daniel 9 is a direct continuation of Daniel

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.750
8. As Daniel is pouring out his heart to God
in prayer, the same angel Gabriel returns

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:01.389
to help him to further understand the vision!
Specifically, the missing time element of

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.780
the vision. Daniel states
Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.620
the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision
at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly,

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:20.320
touched me about the time of the evening oblation.
In Daniel 9:23, Gabriel states that he has

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.810
come to help Daniel to understand this mysterious
vision:

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.320
At the beginning of thy supplications the
commandment came forth, and I am come to shew

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.660
thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore
understand the matter, and consider the vision.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.610
Now, Gabriel begins to address the only part
of the prophecy that Daniel was missing – the

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.870
specific timing of the vision.
Speaking to Daniel, he states:

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.070
“Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people
and upon thy holy city..”

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:59.910
This first 70-weeks section of the prophecy
is “determined” or cut off specifically

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:07.210
for Daniel’s people, the Jews. It is part
of the overall 2300 day prophecy that was

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.140
described in chapter 8.
Please pay careful attention to this first

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:18.910
70 week period, as it describes a magnificent
prophecy of the Messiah, and provides the

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:27.639
key for unlocking the larger 2300 day prophecy.
So, this prophecy would last for 70 prophetic

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:35.229
weeks or 490 days. It’s Important to note
that, when dealing with time in symbolic prophecy

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:42.490
such as Daniel 9, 1 day equals a year.
This principle is seen throughout Scripture,

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:49.050
and I will provide 2 notable examples here:
We read in Numbers 14:34 “After the number

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.810
of the days in which ye searched the land,
even forty days, each day for a year, shall

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.639
ye bear your iniquities, even forty years…”
And Ezekiel 4:6 states “…I have appointed

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:03.281
thee each day for a year.”
But perhaps the greatest evidence for the

00:07:03.281 --> 00:07:09.580
day-for-year principle is the simple fact
that it works! When we apply this principle

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:16.120
to Daniel 9, you will see an amazing prophecy
of the Messiah perfectly fulfilled.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:24.190
So, we know that this prophecy will last for
70 weeks, or 490 literal years. But in order

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:30.330
for us to understand when this prophecy would
end, we must first know when it began.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:36.020
Gabriel gives us the clue in verse 25
Know therefore and understand, that from the

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:41.020
going forth of the commandment to restore
and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.039
Prince…
So, the starting point for this prophecy would

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:49.270
be the command to both restore and rebuild
Jerusalem.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.980
Fortunately, the Bible tells us EXACTLY when
this happened!

00:07:53.980 --> 00:08:00.240
The Old Testament book of Ezra describes several
decrees, but chapter 7 of Ezra describes the

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:07.490
only decree that commanded both the restoration
and rebuilding of Jerusalem. Verse 7 reveals

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:14.419
to us that this decree, made by King Artaxerxes
during the Autumn season, took place in the

00:08:14.419 --> 00:08:22.520
7th year of the king, which was 457 BC.
Now, we have the starting point of the prophecy

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:28.370
– 457 BC.
Gabriel now describes what will happen next,

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:32.580
and when it will happen:
Know therefore and understand, that from the

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:37.589
going forth of the commandment to restore
and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the

00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:44.099
Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore
and two weeks: the street shall be built again,

00:08:44.099 --> 00:08:51.260
and the wall, even in troublous times.
7 weeks, plus threescore and 2 weeks, equals

00:08:51.260 --> 00:09:01.350
69 prophetic weeks. These 69 weeks, or 483
days, using the day-for-year principle, equal

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:07.180
483 literal years.
So, according to the angel Gabriel, Messiah

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:15.460
the Prince would arrive 483 years after 457
BC, the starting point of the prophecy. This

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:24.279
would bring us to the fall of 27 AD. Did anything
significant happen in 27 AD? Did the Messiah

00:09:24.279 --> 00:09:30.089
truly come on this date?
Yes – He did! The Bible actually uses the

00:09:30.089 --> 00:09:33.970
word Messiah to refer to the “anointed”
one.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:42.320
Acts 10:38 tells us “How God anointed Jesus
of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power…”

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:48.400
And we can see that this anointing with the
Holy Ghost took place at Jesus’ baptism:

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:54.130
Now when all the people were baptized, it
came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized,

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:59.170
and praying, the heaven was opened,
And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:05.180
like a dove upon him, and a voice came from
heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son;

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:11.070
in thee I am well pleased.
In Luke 3:1, The Bible reveals that this event

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:19.899
happened during the 15th year of Tiberius
Caesar, which was, you guessed it, AD 27.

00:10:19.899 --> 00:10:28.440
Yes, amazingly, Jesus Christ, the Messiah,
the anointed one, was baptized right on time,

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:34.300
fulfilling the prophecy exactly!
Friends, we can have confidence that the Bible

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:40.360
is inspired and that Jesus Christ is indeed
the promised Messiah!

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:46.829
So far, we have covered 483 years of this
490 year prophecy. What would happen next

00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:51.750
during the final prophetic week, or 7 literal
years, of this prophecy?

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:58.779
Let’s read about it in Daniel 9:26-27:
And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah

00:10:58.779 --> 00:11:04.839
be cut off, but not for himself…And he shall
confirm the covenant with many for one week:

00:11:04.839 --> 00:11:10.440
and in the midst of the week he shall cause
the sacrifice and the oblation to cease…

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:16.600
So, according to the prophecy, Jesus, the
Messiah, would be “cut off” in the midst

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:22.890
of this final prophetic week, or literal 7
years, of the prophecy. The middle of this

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:29.649
week would be 3 ½ years after Jesus was anointed
as the Messiah, which would bring us to the

00:11:29.649 --> 00:11:39.120
spring of AD 31, which was the time of Jesus’crucifixion
– His sacrifice for the human race.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:44.720
Here we see a glimpse of the gospel – a
beautiful portrait of the sacrificial death

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.620
of our Savior! Notice the verse says that
the

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:55.450
Messiah be cut off, but not for himself…
Jesus died not for His own sins, but for your

00:11:55.450 --> 00:12:02.680
sins, and mine. Isaiah 53:5 reveals
But he was wounded for our transgressions,

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:10.160
he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement
of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.570
we are healed.
The verse says that He would

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:17.450
“cause the sacrifice and the oblation to
cease…”

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:24.089
The entire sanctuary service had been designed
to point forward to the coming Messiah. For

00:12:24.089 --> 00:12:29.660
example, the lambs that were slain each day
represented the Lamb of God, who would take

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:35.720
away the sins of the world.
Jesus Christ fulfilled these sanctuary symbols,

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:42.800
and His death on the cross caused the sacrificial
system to end. In fact, when Jesus died, the

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:49.250
elaborate curtain that separated the Holy
Place from the Most Holy Place of the sanctuary

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:56.139
literally ripped in half. This was a symbol
that the earthly sanctuary was no longer the

00:12:56.139 --> 00:13:02.180
place for God’s presence, and that, because
of Jesus’ sacrificial death, a way has been

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:08.960
opened for us to come to God.
Jesus died so that you and I can be saved,

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:15.510
and have eternal life. For more information
on the plan of salvation, watch the powerful

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:23.209
video “Jesus Christ, the Lamb of Bible Prophecy”.
As we return to the prophecy, we can see that

00:13:23.209 --> 00:13:29.360
there is just 3 and ½ years remaining – the
second half of the final prophetic week.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:35.459
Remember, the 70 weeks of this prophecy were
designated for Daniel’s people the Jews,

00:13:35.459 --> 00:13:39.380
who were in captivity at that time. Jesus
was to

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.890
“confirm the covenant with many for one
week”.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:47.630
During this final week of the prophecy, Jesus
would confirm the covenant not only by his

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:53.780
perfect life, death, and resurrection, but
by giving the nation of Israel an opportunity

00:13:53.780 --> 00:14:00.430
to repent, even after he died.
How did Jesus do this? Through the apostles.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:05.630
Notice how Jesus directed his disciples to
first preach the gospel to the Jews, before

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:09.640
sharing the good news with the rest of the
world:

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:15.250
These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded
them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles,

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:20.990
and into any city of the Samaritans enter
ye not: But go rather to the lost sheep of

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:26.680
the house of Israel.
So, God gave the nation of Israel every opportunity

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:32.430
to accept Jesus as the Messiah, but unfortunately,
they rejected Him.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:38.500
In AD 34, Stephen, a deacon and follower of
Christ, was filled with the Holy Spirit and

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:44.570
preached a powerful sermon to the Jews, in
which he revealed to them that they had crucified

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:50.570
the promised Messiah. Rather than repent,
the Jews were filled with raged and stoned

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:56.329
Stephen to death.
This event in AD 34, the final year of the

00:14:56.329 --> 00:15:02.250
prophecy, marks the ultimate rejection of
the Messiah by the Jewish nation, and the

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:08.540
end of the 70 weeks.
This first 70-week, or 490 year section of

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:16.500
the prophecy, is proof-positive that the day-for-year
principle is accurate, and that Jesus is the

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:23.019
Messiah. No human mind could have ever devised
such incredible precision and fulfillment

00:15:23.019 --> 00:15:28.529
of prophecy.
Now we will return to the 2300-day prophecy,

00:15:28.529 --> 00:15:34.139
of which the 70 weeks was just a portion.
“…Unto two thousand and three hundred

00:15:34.139 --> 00:15:41.110
days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.”
When we apply the day-for-year principle,

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:49.550
which has already been established, we can
see that 2,300 prophetic days = 2,300 literal

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:57.020
years. Beginning at 457 BC, the starting point
of the prophecy, 2300 years brings us to the

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:04.950
year 1844 AD.
It was in 1844 that the cleansing of the Heavenly

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:11.839
sanctuary began. Just like the cleansing of
the earthly sanctuary, this event is known

00:16:11.839 --> 00:16:17.480
as the judgment, is happening right now in
the courts of Heaven, and will last until

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:22.820
the soon return of Jesus Christ.
In the earthly service, which was a shadow

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:29.470
of the cleansing of the Heavenly sanctuary,
this event was known as the Day of Atonement.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:36.740
The word atonement can be best understood
by breaking the word down: AT ONE MENT

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:42.680
-The purpose of the judgment is to bring us
back into harmony with God. To make us AT

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:51.339
ONE with Him. To bridge the gap that sin has
caused. To make us more like Jesus.

00:16:51.339 --> 00:16:56.690
On this day, the Israelites were to to refrain
from working, and search their heart for any

00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:04.410
sins. Their attention was drawn to the high
priest who interceded with God on their behalf.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:10.680
So it with us today dear friend. We must avoid
trusting in our works for salvation. We must

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:17.470
search our hearts, confessing and forsaking
any sins, and finally, we must keep our eyes

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:25.100
on Jesus – our great high priest, who intercedes
in our behalf before the Father above.

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:32.970
Friend, we are living in a remarkable time
of earths history! The hour of God’s judgment

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:39.950
has come! I urge you to give your heart to
Jesus today, and surrender anything in your

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:46.960
life that displeases Him, letting Him be your
advocate in the judgment. If this is your

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:53.631
desire today, and it’s clear to you that
