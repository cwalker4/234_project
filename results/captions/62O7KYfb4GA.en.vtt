00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.840
Whats up everyone
Today lets do anchoring

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.900
Drop port anchor!

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.900
HWAT?!

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.520
So theres alot types of anchor out there,
the most common type now days on merchant

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.480
navy ships, especially large ships, are the
stockless type.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.010
And that's mainly because the design is flat
and can be stored away easily.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.640
Usually you'll see it tucked away just beneath
the bow.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.469
This one here is our spare anchor.

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.851
A typical stockless type will have its crown,
the arms and the flukes in one piece, its

00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:06.880
design to pivot on the shank, Shank is the
term for the center piece.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.681
Contraty to many believe... the anchor actually
dont hold the ship, the anchor only digs into

00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:14.080
the sea bed and holds the chain.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.030
Its the length and weight of the chains that
holds the ship.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.210
Its all about horizontal force , later I will
show you guys how it works.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.950
Now At the forward station we've got two anchors
, one on each side which can be lowered or

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.740
heave up control by the windlass.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.979
The anchor chain leads up to the hawse pipe
through the windlass, down the spurling pipe

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.600
into the chain locker where its stored.

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.180
Here is the chain locker, normally its kept
closed but today I was following chief mate

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.100
for an visual inspection.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.250
The big drum is called the Gypsy.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.700
Some item of interest here are the guillotine
bar, also known as bow stopper or pawl bar.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.560
which traps and holds the chain in place,
incase the brake fails.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:25.300
The metal wire attached are the lashing holding
it in place when not in use.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.201
By putting the dog clutch into gear, we can
either heave up or lower the anchor.

00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:38.970
Windlass is the term for this whole system
used to heave up or lower anchor and mooring

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.900
lines.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:01.351
The anchor alone is about 9000kgs or 20,000
lbs, plus the chains thats quite heavy, which

00:03:01.351 --> 00:03:06.300
is why using the windlass its still a slow
process.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.140
Heaving up is always going to be slow,
But for lowering the anchor there is actaully

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.150
another way , a faster way which is to let
the anchor fly out.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.810
What that means is having the anchor chain
disengaged from dog clutch and brakes, and

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.980
lowered by gravity.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.060
The only way to stop it though is by engaging
the brakes.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.640
Here is what it looks like.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.320
As you can see it is quite violent, lots of
vibration, debris flying everywhere, and a

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.660
lot more risky then by motors.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.300
If you aren't careful this might happen.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.620
If we still have the anchor, well brakes on
tight, bar down and pin in, securing the anchor

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.280
So how do the anchor, anchor chains hold the
ship in place?

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.070
Well remember the keyword is horizontal forces.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.160
Casey Nesitat time
Let me show you from the begining

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.280
The ship should always be down wind or down
current whichever is stronger, slightly drifting

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.620
backwards . so that when a anchor is lowered
into the water, the crown catches and set

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.440
onto the sea bed. with the engine and or the
current, walking the ship back to pay out

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.590
the chains.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.201
A useful trick to figure out the current or
tidal direction is simply just look at the

00:05:33.201 --> 00:05:38.040
nearby anchored ships, all anchored ship will
follow the heading of current.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.380
A horizontal pull gives the anchor its holding
power digging into the sea bed.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.490
The weight of the chain, this curve section
also known as the catenary, holds the ship.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.360
So the more chain laid, the greater the holding
power

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.550
A general rule of thumb is 1:5 ratio for good
weather, 1:7 or more for bad weather.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.400
It varies between ship size and type.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.990
For deck officers, An anchor circle should
be drawn with the radius being the length

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.270
of cables laid plus from bow to radar antenna
so that you can monitor the ship on radar

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.270
and ecidis.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.580
So we drop our anchor plus how many cables
we laid out plus the ship's length

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.580
see this is the anchor circle on the outside,
past position swings back and forth because

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.130
the tidal wave is semi-durinal

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.990
Dont forget to show the anchor ball &amp; signal
! Anchor light

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.840
During anchor watches, the crew have to check
the weather and sea conditions

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.160
as well as status of the chain.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.400
We want avoid dragging the anchor and drift
somewhere or drift into another ship, that

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.170
would be bad...

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:53.640
The crew will look at the chain phsyically
and report back.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.220
The terms we use are.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.470
up'n'down, short stay, medium stay or long
stay, long stay means there is a high chance

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.560
of dragging anchor because the chain is being
pulled like this.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.250
To heave up, just walk the ship over the anchor
and pull up with the windlass because remebmer

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.520
its not designed to hold vertical forces.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.860
How do you count anchor chain?

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.060
Well in the old days, every length of cable
is marked between the shackles, one shackle

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.720
is about 27.5 meters.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.610
Nowdays modern ships have guages that show
how many chains are laid.
