00:00:00.191 --> 00:00:02.660
BECAUSE IT’S OBVIOUS.

00:00:01.425 --> 00:00:03.761
OUR LEADERS SPEND MOST OF

00:00:02.794 --> 00:00:07.865
THEIR TIME DENYING IT THEY

00:00:03.895 --> 00:00:09.400
ARE LYING TO US.

00:00:08.065 --> 00:00:10.068
&gt;&gt; Tucker: A PHOENIX CITY

00:00:09.534 --> 00:00:12.470
COUNCIL MEMBER RUNNING FOR

00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:13.638
MAYOR IN THAT CITY AND SHE

00:00:12.603 --> 00:00:13.938
SUPPORTS THE CONTINUATION OF

00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:14.739
DACA.

00:00:14.072 --> 00:00:15.773
SHE JOINS US TONIGHT.

00:00:14.872 --> 00:00:16.274
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:00:15.907 --> 00:00:17.075
I APPRECIATE IT?

00:00:16.407 --> 00:00:18.543
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:19.277
HAVING ME.

00:00:18.743 --> 00:00:20.945
&gt;&gt; Tucker: SO TRYING TO

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.647
THINK THROUGH HOW LEGALIZING

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:23.381
PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.616
ILLEGALLY HELPS AMERICAN

00:00:23.515 --> 00:00:26.284
CITIZENS AND IN ARIZONA WE

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:27.419
HAVE SOME DATA ON THIS

00:00:26.417 --> 00:00:28.286
BECAUSE IT -- THE STATE

00:00:27.552 --> 00:00:29.654
PASSED AS YOU KNOW ONE OF

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.588
THE TOUGHEST

00:00:29.788 --> 00:00:31.756
ANTI-IMMIGRATION LAWS IN THE

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:32.991
COUNTRY IN 2010.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.458
AND THE EFFECTS OF THAT HAVE

00:00:33.124 --> 00:00:34.359
BEEN STUDIED.

00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:36.661
HERE IS WHAT THEY SHOWED

00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:37.362
THERE WAS A SHORT-TERM LABOR

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:38.330
SHORTAGE OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:38.630
HERE TO WORK, THEY CAN’T

00:00:38.463 --> 00:00:40.899
WORK.

00:00:38.763 --> 00:00:42.634
THERE WAS A LABOR SHORTAGE.

00:00:41.032 --> 00:00:44.436
OVER TIME AUTOMATION MADE UP

00:00:42.768 --> 00:00:45.804
FOR IT AND WAGES WENT UP FOR

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:46.705
AMERICAN WORKERS, COSTS

00:00:45.937 --> 00:00:48.006
MEANWHILE WENT DOWN.

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:50.008
PRISON COSTS WENT DOWN,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.076
EDUCATION COSTS WENT DOWN.

00:00:50.142 --> 00:00:51.710
DRAMATICALLY BY HUNDREDS OF

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:53.045
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:54.479
SO GIVEN THAT WE KNOW THAT

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:56.782
WHY DOES IT HELP THE ECONOMY

00:00:54.613 --> 00:00:57.149
TO LEGALIZE PEOPLE HERE

00:00:56.915 --> 00:00:58.784
ILLEGALLY?

00:00:57.282 --> 00:00:59.952
&gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW THE CITY OF

00:00:58.917 --> 00:01:01.220
PHOENIX IS THE FASTEST

00:01:00.085 --> 00:01:01.553
GROWING CITY IN THE ENTIRE

00:01:01.353 --> 00:01:03.756
COUNTRY.

00:01:01.687 --> 00:01:05.290
WE HAVE ADDED MORE PEOPLE IN

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:06.959
2016 THAN ANY OTHER CITY AND

00:01:05.424 --> 00:01:07.760
WE ARE CONSTRAINED BY OUR

00:01:07.092 --> 00:01:09.128
WORKFORCE RIGHT NOW.

00:01:07.893 --> 00:01:10.295
WE JUST HAD SOME FOLKS FROM

00:01:09.261 --> 00:01:11.430
THE HOME BUILDING INDUSTRY

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:12.598
COME INTO THE CITY OF

00:01:11.563 --> 00:01:15.367
PHOENIX AND SAY WE COULD DO

00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:16.201
SO MUCH MORE IF WE HAD A

00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:16.568
LARGER CONSTRUCTION

00:01:16.335 --> 00:01:17.603
WORKFORCE.

00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:18.003
WE’LL COULD BE CREATING

00:01:17.736 --> 00:01:19.838
JOBS.

00:01:18.137 --> 00:01:20.573
WE COULD BE BUILDING NEW

00:01:19.972 --> 00:01:21.273
AFFORDABLE HOMES FOR PEOPLE

00:01:20.706 --> 00:01:23.142
TO LIVE IN.

00:01:21.407 --> 00:01:23.943
BUT WE DON’T HAVE THE

00:01:23.275 --> 00:01:25.511
WORKFORCE WE NEED.

00:01:24.076 --> 00:01:27.480
AND THEY SAID THAT THE POINT

00:01:25.644 --> 00:01:29.348
THAT THEY REALLY FEEL LIKE

00:01:27.613 --> 00:01:31.851
IT’S CHANGED WAS NOT HAVING

00:01:29.482 --> 00:01:32.251
ENOUGH PEOPLE THROUGH

00:01:31.984 --> 00:01:32.785
IMMIGRATION.

00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:34.420
&gt;&gt; Tucker: YEAH.

00:01:32.918 --> 00:01:36.155
WELL, A LOT OF -- I BET THEY

00:01:34.553 --> 00:01:37.323
FEEL THAT WAY.

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.825
NO, A LOT OF EMPLOYERS MAKE

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.660
THAT CASE AND THEY MEAN IT

00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.960
THEY WANT OBVIOUSLY CHEAPER

00:01:40.793 --> 00:01:42.028
LABOR.

00:01:41.093 --> 00:01:43.196
I THINK ALL EMPLOYERS DO.

00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:44.697
WHY WOULDN’T THEY?

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.199
BUT, IF THAT’S TRUE, IF

00:01:44.831 --> 00:01:49.135
MORISM LEGAL IMMIGRANTS MAKE

00:01:46.332 --> 00:01:50.436
A PLACE RICHER, THEN HOW

00:01:49.268 --> 00:01:51.971
MANY SPECIFICALLY DO YOU

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.271
THINK ARIZONA OR PHOENIX

00:01:52.105 --> 00:01:53.239
NEEDS?

00:01:52.405 --> 00:01:55.041
HOW MANY ILLEGALS DO YOU

00:01:53.373 --> 00:01:55.375
NEED IN YOUR CITY TO MAKE IT

00:01:55.174 --> 00:01:56.676
RICHER?

00:01:55.508 --> 00:01:57.810
WOULD MORE BE BETTER?

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:59.112
HOW ABOUT 10 MILLION?

00:01:57.944 --> 00:01:59.445
WOULD IT MAKE IT EVEN

00:01:59.245 --> 00:02:00.747
RICHER?

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.649
&gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW WE ARE

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.983
DESPERATELY CONCERNED ABOUT

00:02:02.782 --> 00:02:04.918
OUR DACA RECIPIENTS WHO ARE

00:02:04.117 --> 00:02:08.188
IN OUR CITY.

00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:09.789
ARIZONA HAS 28,000 DACA

00:02:08.321 --> 00:02:10.490
RECIPIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN

00:02:09.923 --> 00:02:11.358
GREAT MEMBERS OF OUR

00:02:10.624 --> 00:02:12.959
COMMUNITY WHO WENT TO OUR

00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:13.260
HIGH SCHOOLS, WERE EDUCATED

00:02:13.093 --> 00:02:14.594
HERE.

00:02:13.393 --> 00:02:15.362
WE HAVE BEEN INVESTING IN

00:02:14.728 --> 00:02:17.063
THEM FOR YEARS.

00:02:15.495 --> 00:02:17.998
NOW THEY ARE READY TO GIVE

00:02:17.197 --> 00:02:19.432
BACK AND WE ARE WORRIED

00:02:18.131 --> 00:02:19.699
ABOUT THEIR FUTURE RIGHT

00:02:19.566 --> 00:02:20.767
NOW.

00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:23.437
OUR REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR HAS

00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:24.538
STEPPED UP AND SAID THEY’RE

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.871
AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR

00:02:24.671 --> 00:02:27.007
ECONOMY.

00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:27.574
WE WANT THEM TO STAY.

00:02:27.207 --> 00:02:29.076
&gt;&gt; Tucker: RIGHT.

00:02:27.707 --> 00:02:30.410
NO BUT YOU JUST SAID, I JUST

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.378
WANT TO GET TO THE NUMBER OF

00:02:30.544 --> 00:02:32.112
IT THOUGH BECAUSE I THINK

00:02:31.511 --> 00:02:33.080
IT’S A BIG DEAL.

00:02:32.245 --> 00:02:34.915
WOULD YOU LEGALIZE PEOPLE.

00:02:33.213 --> 00:02:35.282
THEY VOTE, THEY BRING THEIR

00:02:35.048 --> 00:02:36.517
RELATIVES.

00:02:35.415 --> 00:02:38.318
IT CHANGES THE PLACE, MAYBE

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.619
FOR THE BETTER, MAYBE TO THE

00:02:38.452 --> 00:02:39.920
WORSE.

00:02:38.752 --> 00:02:41.021
WE SHOULD BE CLEAR ABOUT THE

00:02:40.053 --> 00:02:41.321
EFFECTS I THINK YOU WOULD

00:02:41.155 --> 00:02:42.689
AGREE.

00:02:41.455 --> 00:02:44.224
IF BRINGING IN MORE PEOPLE

00:02:42.823 --> 00:02:46.360
ILLEGALLY AND MAKING THEM

00:02:44.358 --> 00:02:47.161
CITIZENS MAKES YOU MORE

00:02:46.493 --> 00:02:48.762
PROSPEROUS THEN WHY WOULDN’T

00:02:47.294 --> 00:02:50.264
YOU BRING IN 10 MILLION AND

00:02:48.896 --> 00:02:50.831
BECOME REALLY REALLY RICH.

00:02:50.397 --> 00:02:52.666
WOULD THAT WORK?

00:02:50.965 --> 00:02:54.935
&gt;&gt; IMMIGRANTS HAVE BEEN

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.536
AMAZING CONTRIBUTORS TO OUR

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.103
COMMUNITY.

00:02:55.736 --> 00:02:56.837
&gt;&gt; Tucker: RIGHT?

00:02:56.237 --> 00:02:59.073
&gt;&gt; IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF

00:02:56.971 --> 00:03:01.375
THE DATA FROM FORWARD DOT

00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:01.809
U.S. MARK ZUCKERBERG’S

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:02.376
ORGANIZATION.

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:03.144
&gt;&gt; Tucker: I BET.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.179
&gt;&gt; SO MANY OF THE

00:03:03.277 --> 00:03:06.514
ENTREPRENEURS WHO BUILT OUR

00:03:05.346 --> 00:03:08.115
TECH ECONOMY CAME HERE

00:03:06.647 --> 00:03:10.284
THROUGH IMMIGRATION.

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:11.886
AND WE IN PHOENIX ARE

00:03:10.418 --> 00:03:14.555
DESPERATE FOR MORE PEOPLE IN

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.889
ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:15.656
SCIENCE.

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:16.557
&gt;&gt; Tucker: HOW MANY BIG TECH

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.658
COMPANIES WERE STARTED BY

00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:19.193
PEOPLE FROM CENTRAL AND

00:03:17.792 --> 00:03:20.128
SOUTH AMERICA?

00:03:19.327 --> 00:03:21.996
LATIN AMERICA?

00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:23.398
&gt;&gt; SO, RIGHT NOW I’M SITTING

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.932
IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA, VERY

00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:27.168
CLOSE TO A COMPANY CALLED

GENTLEMAN FROM PANAMA.

00:03:29.137 --> 00:03:32.473

A WONDERFUL SUCCESS STORY.

00:03:41.382 --> 00:03:43.718

MANY SUCCESS STORIES IN THIS

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.429
COMMUNITY AND SOME OF THEM

00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:55.297
HAVE GOTTEN NATIONAL

00:03:54.563 --> 00:03:55.830
ATTENTION.

00:03:55.497 --> 00:03:57.165
&gt;&gt; Tucker: OKAY.

00:03:55.964 --> 00:03:58.600
SO I JUST WANT TO BE -- WITH

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.000
RESPECT, I’M NOT ATTACKING

00:03:58.733 --> 00:03:59.768
IMMIGRANTS.

00:03:59.134 --> 00:04:00.869
I LIKE IMMIGRANTS.

00:03:59.901 --> 00:04:02.037
I’M SURE A LOT OF THESE

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.539
BUT PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE,

00:04:03.338 --> 00:04:05.540
WHO ARE BORN HERE WHO ARE

00:04:04.673 --> 00:04:06.675
CITIZENS HAVE THE RIGHT TO

KNOW THE EFFECTS OF THIS.

00:04:06.808 --> 00:04:09.945
SO HOW MANY IS THE OPTIMUM

00:04:09.745 --> 00:04:12.014
NUMBER?

00:04:10.078 --> 00:04:14.650
IF BRINGING IN PEOPLE

ILLEGALLY AND MAKES YOU MORE

00:04:14.783 --> 00:04:17.085
PROSPEROUS WHAT’S THE IDEAL

00:04:16.084 --> 00:04:17.920
NUMBER WE SHOULD GIVE

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:19.655
CITIZENSHIP TO?

00:04:18.053 --> 00:04:21.890
&gt;&gt; OUR COUNTRY AND OUR

00:04:19.788 --> 00:04:22.624
COMMUNITY WAS BUILT BY

00:04:22.024 --> 00:04:23.392
IMMIGRATION.

00:04:22.825 --> 00:04:24.660
&gt;&gt; Tucker: OKAY YOU ARE NOT.

00:04:23.525 --> 00:04:26.395
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE SOME STORIES IN

00:04:24.793 --> 00:04:26.996
THIS COMMUNITY.

00:04:26.595 --> 00:04:27.629
&gt;&gt; Tucker: STORIES.

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:31.333
I AM ASKING FOR FACTS.

00:04:27.763 --> 00:04:31.634
I THINK IT’S FAIR TO ASK FOR

00:04:31.467 --> 00:04:32.601
FACTS.

00:04:31.767 --> 00:04:33.302
RESEARCHER GOT AHOLD OF THE

00:04:32.735 --> 00:04:34.136
CONVICTION NUMBERS WHICH THE

00:04:33.435 --> 00:04:35.404
GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE OF

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.138
ARIZONA HAS HIDDEN FROM THE

00:04:35.537 --> 00:04:37.106
POPULATION BECAUSE IT’S

00:04:36.272 --> 00:04:37.873
LYING TO THE POPULATION

00:04:37.239 --> 00:04:38.908
ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF

00:04:38.007 --> 00:04:40.810
IMMIGRATION AS YOU KNOW.

00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:41.744
AND HE FOUND THAT ILLEGAL

00:04:40.943 --> 00:04:42.945
IMMIGRANTS IN THE STATE OF

00:04:41.877 --> 00:04:45.414
ARIZONA WERE MORE THAN TWICE

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:46.749
AS LIKELY TO COMMIT MURDER

00:04:45.548 --> 00:04:48.050
AND OVERALL FAR MORE LIKELY

00:04:46.882 --> 00:04:48.351
TO COMMIT CRIMES OF ALL

00:04:48.184 --> 00:04:50.052
KINDS.

00:04:48.484 --> 00:04:51.187
NOT IMMIGRATION CRIMES BUT

00:04:50.186 --> 00:04:52.555
VIOLENT AND PROPERTY CRIMES.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.791
SO GIVEN THAT THOSE ARE

00:04:52.688 --> 00:04:56.792
FACTS, HOW CAN YOU REASSURE

00:04:55.925 --> 00:04:59.195
THE RESIDENTS, LEGAL

00:04:56.926 --> 00:05:00.430
RESIDENTS OF ARIZONA OF ALL

00:04:59.328 --> 00:05:01.097
BACKGROUND THAT THIS IS GOOD

00:05:00.563 --> 00:05:03.800
FOR THEM.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.468
I DON’T UNDERSTAND.

00:05:03.933 --> 00:05:06.803
&gt;&gt; WE IN CITIES THROUGHOUT

00:05:05.601 --> 00:05:07.737
OUR COMMUNITY HAVE SEEN

00:05:06.936 --> 00:05:08.771
GREAT SUCCESS STORIES WHEN

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.872
PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY CAN

00:05:08.905 --> 00:05:11.140
WORK WITH THE POLICE

00:05:10.006 --> 00:05:11.441
DEPARTMENT AND THERE IS

00:05:11.274 --> 00:05:14.410
TRUST.

00:05:11.574 --> 00:05:15.645
SO WE HAVE HAD FOLKS WHO DID

00:05:14.544 --> 00:05:16.813
NOT HAVE LEGAL IMMIGRATION

00:05:15.778 --> 00:05:17.514
STATUS BUT WERE WILLING TO

00:05:16.946 --> 00:05:18.314
WORK WITH OUR POLICE

00:05:17.647 --> 00:05:19.582
DEPARTMENT AND HAVE BEEN

00:05:18.448 --> 00:05:20.617
VERY IMPORTANT IN HELPING US

00:05:19.716 --> 00:05:21.885
PARTICULAR WHETHER I

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.119
DRUG-RELATED CRIMES.

00:05:22.085 --> 00:05:23.720
&gt;&gt; Tucker: BUT DO YOU

00:05:23.253 --> 00:05:24.454
ACKNOWLEDGE -- DO YOU

00:05:23.853 --> 00:05:26.389
ACKNOWLEDGE THE REALITY OF

00:05:24.587 --> 00:05:28.592
WHAT I JUST SAID SO THIS

00:05:26.523 --> 00:05:29.292
STUDY WHICH GOT AHOLD OF

00:05:28.725 --> 00:05:30.794
ARIZONA’S STATE NUMBERS,

00:05:29.426 --> 00:05:32.562
WHICH I THINK ARE

00:05:30.927 --> 00:05:34.497
LEGITIMATE, SAYS THAT PEOPLE

00:05:32.696 --> 00:05:35.732
ILLEGALLY IN ARIZONA ARE FAR

00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:36.333
MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT

00:05:35.866 --> 00:05:37.801
SERIOUS CRIME.

00:05:36.466 --> 00:05:39.035
DO YOU NOT BELIEVE THAT?

00:05:37.934 --> 00:05:40.971
OR ARE YOU JUST IGNORING IT

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.271
OR WHAT’S YOUR RESPONSE TO

00:05:41.104 --> 00:05:42.339
THAT?

00:05:41.404 --> 00:05:43.740
&gt;&gt; SO I JUST RECEIVED THE

00:05:42.472 --> 00:05:45.308
ARREST AND CRIME DATA FROM

00:05:43.874 --> 00:05:46.910
THE LAST CALENDAR YEAR 2017

00:05:45.442 --> 00:05:48.178
FOR THE CITY OF PHOENIX.

00:05:47.044 --> 00:05:49.479
AND THAT WASN’T WHAT WE

00:05:48.312 --> 00:05:50.547
FOUND IN THE CITY OF

00:05:49.613 --> 00:05:51.248
PHOENIX.

00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:53.450
UNFORTUNATELY, VIOLENT CRIME

00:05:51.381 --> 00:05:55.319
WAS LED BY PEOPLE WHO LIVE

00:05:53.584 --> 00:05:56.820
HERE AND WHO WERE BORN HERE.

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:57.187
&gt;&gt; Tucker: THAT’S NOT THE

00:05:56.954 --> 00:05:58.856
QUESTION.

00:05:57.321 --> 00:05:59.890
PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE

00:05:58.989 --> 00:06:01.058
ILLEGALLY MORE LIKELY OR

00:06:00.023 --> 00:06:02.359
LESS LIKELY TO COMMIT

00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:02.760
SERIOUS CRIMES IN THE CITY

00:06:02.493 --> 00:06:03.827
OF PHOENIX.

00:06:02.893 --> 00:06:04.628
ARE YOU SAYING THEY WERE

00:06:03.961 --> 00:06:05.295
LESS LIKELY?

00:06:04.762 --> 00:06:05.996
I DON’T THINK THAT’S WHAT

00:06:05.429 --> 00:06:08.399
THE NUMBERS SHOW.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.633
&gt;&gt; OUR 2017 NUMBERS TELL A

00:06:08.532 --> 00:06:11.302
VERY DIFFERENT STORY THAN

00:06:09.767 --> 00:06:13.170
THE STORY THAT THAT

00:06:11.435 --> 00:06:15.573
RESEARCHER IS TELLING YOU.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.807
&gt;&gt; Tucker: SO YOU ROUX

00:06:15.706 --> 00:06:17.942
SAYING JUST TO BE CLEAR ARE

00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:19.176
YOU SAYING HAVE YOU SEEN

00:06:18.075 --> 00:06:20.211
NUMBERS IN THE CITY OF

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.146
PHOENIX PEOPLE HERE

00:06:20.344 --> 00:06:23.314
ILLEGALLY WERE LESS LIKELY

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:24.048
TO COMMIT SERIOUS CRIMES

00:06:23.447 --> 00:06:25.249
THAN CITIZENS?

00:06:24.181 --> 00:06:25.983
IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING?

00:06:25.383 --> 00:06:26.317
I WANT TO GET YOU ON THE

00:06:26.117 --> 00:06:28.119
RECORD.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.086
&gt;&gt; WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE

00:06:28.252 --> 00:06:29.720
IMMIGRATION REFORM.

00:06:29.287 --> 00:06:31.022
&gt;&gt; Tucker: OH, YOU ARE

00:06:29.854 --> 00:06:31.389
SLIPPING OUT OF THE

00:06:31.155 --> 00:06:32.390
QUESTION.

00:06:31.522 --> 00:06:33.391
I AM ASKING A VERY SIMPLE

00:06:32.523 --> 00:06:34.792
QUESTION AND YOU ARE NOT
