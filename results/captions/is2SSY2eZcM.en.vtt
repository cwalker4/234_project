00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.880
- Yesterday, an Ethiopian
Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.500
crashed just six minutes after
takeoff with no survivors.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.880
All 149 passengers and
eight crew members perished.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.330
The aeroplane was just four months old.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.850
This is not the first crash
involving the Boeing 737 MAX 8.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.300
Just four months ago, Indonesian
Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX 8

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.210
crashed minutes after takeoff
from Jakarta into the Java Sea.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.290
All 189 passengers and crew perished.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.420
So two back to back fatal crashes

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.340
that killed almost 350
people in just four months

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.390
has raised serious concerns regarding the safety

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.910
of the new Boeing 737 MAX family.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.940
Let's quickly recap on
what happened yesterday

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.480
on the Ethiopian 737 MAX flight.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.760
The 737 MAX 8 was operating
as Ethiopian Airlines 302

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.950
from Addis Ababa to Nairobi.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.360
The registration of the plane was ET-AVJ

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.650
and it vanished from
radio contact with ATZ

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.630
at around 8,600 feet, just
six minutes after departure.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.610
Flight radar 24 determined that vertical speed

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.750
was unstable during takeoff.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.060
Ethiopian Airlines stated that
the plane had had 1,200 hours of use

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.740
and was perfectly maintained.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.364
- [Pilot] Just talked
now with a friend of mine

00:01:15.364 --> 00:01:20.210
who was actually flying on a triple 7 on Ethiopian.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.683
He was on the holding
point just behind them,

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.700
just before they took off.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.010
Apparently, the only thing he told me

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.770
is that they took off normally

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.527
and whilst they were on the climb,

00:01:35.527 --> 00:01:37.650
they declared an emergency

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.920
that they had unreliable air speed

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.130
and they couldn't control the aircraft.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.300
That's the only thing
that he told me for sure

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.520
because he was there and he
was hearing the frequency

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.420
when they switched the frequency.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.780
From there on, he doesn't
know what happened,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.060
but he said definitely a problem,

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.580
that the crew told the tower

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.580
that they had wrong air speed indications

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.340
and they couldn't control the aircraft.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.960
I don't know what the (bleep) is going on

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.320
with that aircraft, man.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.920
Software, I don't know.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.640
I cannot imagine how experienced pilots,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.470
even if it's air speed unreliable,

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.326
can lose control of the aircraft

00:02:19.326 --> 00:02:22.380
if there's not any
problem with any software,

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.610
you know, that's something
that the pilot doesn't see,

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.010
but it's really sad, man, really sad.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.970
- From what we have gathered so far,

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.190
it seems like the sensors
had been disagreeing

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.210
with each other, causing
unreliable air speed,

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.520
which triggered and
activated the MCAS system

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.820
to lower the nose of the
aeroplane for a dive.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.040
We have to wait for
a further investigation

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.230
to be able to come to that conclusion, but what is MCAS?

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.130
- [Captain] MCAS is a new system installed

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.380
on the Boeing 737 MAX aircrafts

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.650
because of the rigour and
lower engine on the aeroplane.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.690
When the pilot inputs
more power on the engine,

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.270
it creates a higher nose-up altitude.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.060
What MCAS does is, it trims the aircraft

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.380
to the nose-down position to
prevent stalling conditions.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.410
The system is completely
independent of pilot input

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.990
and there's no mention of the system

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.880
in any of the pilot manuals.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.510
On the 737, we have electric trim motors

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.060
and we also have manual a trim
wheel to trim the aircraft.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.890
It is still too early to say

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.850
what was the cause of the crash,

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.130
but one of the possibilities can be MCAS

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.320
was trying to trim the aircraft down,

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.790
but pilots did not deactivate the cut-out

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.870
suggested for the electric motors,

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.860
which they were supposed to do.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.270
Again, it is still too early to say.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.580
- Four months ago on October 29th, 2018,

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.350
Indonesian Lion Air Flight
JT610 took off from Jakarta.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.160
Within 13 minutes, it reported difficulty

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.880
and plunged into the Java Sea.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.270
- [Reporter] Investigators say the pilots

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.500
of the doomed flight
struggled to keep the plane

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.640
in the air, pulling the nose up,

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.050
as the plane's computers
pushed it into a fatal dive.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.010
- The computer introduced
a nose-down command

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.960
and the pilots fought it.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.690
They're trying to maintain altitude,

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.280
the computer continues and
the computer, at this point,

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.300
has a more powerful flight control

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.360
and eventually the pilots lose the battle.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.600
- [Reporter] Investigators believe one

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.560
of the plane's sensors, like this one,

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.000
was sending bad data, suggesting the plane

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.540
was flying too slowly.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.350
The computers pushed the nose forward

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.700
to pick up speed and avoid a stall.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.360
Investigators say that
same sensor was replaced

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.100
just the day before after
air speed indicators

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.500
malfunctioned on previous flights.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.960
- Of course, without proper
further investigation,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.640
it is pure speculation to suggest that

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.860
the two fatal crashes
were caused by the same thing.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.420
However, from the flight data available,

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.050
we can see correlations.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.480
Both aircraft were climbing
and then rapidly descending

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.340
with unstable vertical speed.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.310
With so many factors coming in to play

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.910
when an accident happens,
such as human error,

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.570
not following the
procedure, mechanical error,

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.060
the sensor error, aircraft design error,

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.450
we can't rule anything out at this stage.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.070
It is important to stress
that until an investigation

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.927
is complete, there's no
immediate subject to blame.

00:05:15.927 --> 00:05:19.460
Following the two crashes on the 737 MAX,

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.420
many airlines in the world
have been taking precautions.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.130
The FAA on the 11th of March

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.450
said that they have not
received enough evidence

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.540
to ground the Boeing 737
MAX fleet in the U.S.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.880
The Civil Aviation Authority in China

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.370
has ordered all airlines in
China operating the 737 MAX

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.500
to ground the plane immediately.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.130
According to Bloomberg's estimate,

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.310
the 737 accounts for nearly
one third of Boeing's revenue

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.130
and will generate profits of
nearly 30 billion dollars annually

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.240
when production is raised
to 57 aircraft per month.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.160
The 737 MAX is Boeing's
fastest selling plane.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.540
As of January 31st, 2019,
the 737 MAX has accumulated

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.310
more than 5,100 orders with
more than 350 in service

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.310
with 38 operators worldwide.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.320
Last July when I was in Seattle,
I was given a tour

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.410
of the Boeing 737 MAX factory in Renton.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.990
- [Employee] So, our fuselages come in

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.760
from Wichita, Kansas by rail.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.960
You may have seen them
as you guys drove in.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.643
Once they arrive,

00:06:18.643 --> 00:06:21.600
they're basically just
an empty green shell.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.620
We wash that coating off when
we start the paint process

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.370
and so, fuselage arrives,
we'll pull it up here

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.490
and in the overnight hours,

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.060
you'll see the yellow
cranes at the top here.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.050
The cranes will move up,
they'll pick up the fuselages

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.690
and the first three days
they spend in that structure,

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.453
we call it systems installation.

00:06:38.453 --> 00:06:41.010
It's basically where the
aeroplane gets its guts,

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.860
a lot of the electrical,
venting, panelling

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.200
goes on in those initial phases.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.260
And then on the fourth
day, the crane comes back,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.560
drops the aeroplane into
this position in the corner,

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.490
which is called wing to body join.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.720
And that's where it finally
starts to look like an aeroplane.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.620
The tail gets put on,
the wings get put on,

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.260
the landing gear gets
attached in that position.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.360
Once all that happens,
the aeroplane comes up,

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.010
takes a turn and starts
moving down the line,

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.020
so the aeroplane that's
closest to the door down there

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.930
is the one that's ready,
the furthest along,

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.660
and it'll go out, once
it gets its engines,

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.260
it goes out to the paint hanger.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.640
- What's the difference
between the current NG,

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.720
the new generation 73, and the MAX 73?

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.580
- Sure.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.310
So Sam, the MAX has a
few unique differences

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.519
that sets it apart from the NG.

00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:33.519
The most important is the
larger new CFM LEAP-1B engine,

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.350
that 69 inch fan diameter.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.700
That new engine is a lot
more efficient and quieter.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.220
Some other features you'll notice

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.810
are the advanced technology winglet

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.890
with the up and downwards--
- [Sam] Oh yeah.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.006
- [Employee] Shape.
- [Sam] Yep.

00:07:47.006 --> 00:07:52.006
- And then the other is the
APU has a redesigned tail cone.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.731
We've eliminated the vortex
generators on the aft tail

00:07:55.731 --> 00:07:58.220
and if you look really closely,

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.440
you might see that 20 centimetre
rise on the nose wheel

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.190
and then inside, all MAXs
have Boeing Sky Interior,

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.990
which a lot of customers prefer.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.823
- [Sam] Yeah.

00:08:08.823 --> 00:08:10.660
- Over a non-Sky Interior.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.730
- I have also been given
a 737 MAX cockpit tour

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:16.230
during the Farnborough Airshow.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.790
The cockpits show similarity to the 787

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.480
with large information display screens.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.527
- What you're looking at here,

00:08:22.527 --> 00:08:24.880
one of the really cool
things about the aeroplane,

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.840
is 787 primary flight displays.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.070
You can see really high
resolution displays.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.830
What we're doing is
providing great information

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.916
to the flight deck, to the flight crews,

00:08:35.916 --> 00:08:38.050
and also provisioning the aeroplane

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:41.260
for this next generation
of air traffic management

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.270
and flight operations functionality.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.580
- Now as a math geek, one thing I noticed,

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.590
the angle of attack on
climbing on the 737 MAX

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.610
is definitely shallower
than the other plane.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.350
On the other hand, the CFM LEAP-1B engine

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.460
is one of the quietest engines
I've experienced on takeoff.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.710
(plane engine humming)

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.450
I have flown on several 737 MAX models

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.860
and my experience was
very pleasant on them.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.900
I have flown on the 737 MAX
8 on American Airlines,

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.150
Oman Air and Flydubai and also,

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.710
I've flown on the Copa Air 737 MAX 9.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.190
They have a lay flat seat, as well.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.520
Personally, I enjoy
flying on the MAX aircraft

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.680
because it's quieter in the cabin

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.726
and also, the airline typically invests

00:09:36.726 --> 00:09:39.330
in better seats on the new aircraft.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.070
So, is the Boeing 737 MAX
a safe aeroplane to fly?

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.270
I think this is rather a question mark

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.960
than a conclusion right now.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.870
We are all waiting to hear more

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.770
from the crash investigation.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:53.230
There are many questions
that need to be answered.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:54.960
This is news just in today.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.490
On March 12th, Boeing has
confirmed they will deploy

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:00.940
a flight control software
update on the 737 MAX.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.780
This update includes an update

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.160
to the MCAS flight control
log, operation manual,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.310
crew training and the flight display.

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.510
So Boeing indicated that the
enhanced flight control log

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:16.380
incorporates the AOA, which
is the angle of attack input,

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.270
and that also limits the stabiliser trims

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.400
in case of an error reading
the angle of attack.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.570
Here I am sending my deep condolences

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.180
to all the family and
friends of the victims

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.795
who perished in those two tragic crashes.

00:10:30.795 --> 00:10:34.780
Boeing has postponed the 777X launch date.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.100
It was originally scheduled to be tomorrow

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.156
and I was supposed to be in Seattle.

00:10:39.156 --> 00:10:41.872
I think this is a positive move by Boeing;

00:10:41.872 --> 00:10:44.410
rather than celebrating another milestone,

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.820
let's get focused and get to the bottom

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.300
of the cause of the accident
to make the sky more safe.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.450
Thank you for watching.
