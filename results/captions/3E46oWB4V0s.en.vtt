00:00:16.762 --> 00:00:21.972
What's the one decision
that you are going to make in your life

00:00:21.976 --> 00:00:27.726
that's going to determine your future
mental health, happiness and well-being

00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:30.797
more than any other decision
you're going to make?

00:00:31.657 --> 00:00:35.877
Well, that decision is
who you choose to marry.

00:00:35.877 --> 00:00:38.264
Or put another way, who you choose

00:00:38.264 --> 00:00:43.296
to enter into a long-term,
committed, monogamous relationship.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.800
If you get that decision wrong,
and you end up with the wrong person,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.860
then that's going to cause you
more unhappiness and distress

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.372
than any other decision in your life.

00:00:53.372 --> 00:00:55.922
In fact, it's going to be so bad

00:00:55.922 --> 00:01:00.937
that you might as well get a season ticket
to my psychiatric clinic.

00:01:00.937 --> 00:01:03.507
(Laughter)

00:01:03.507 --> 00:01:05.912
Now, the survey data suggests

00:01:05.912 --> 00:01:09.232
that around the world
99% of the population

00:01:09.232 --> 00:01:14.162
desire a single committed,
monogamous, long-term relationship.

00:01:14.162 --> 00:01:16.238
It's something that everyone wants,

00:01:16.238 --> 00:01:20.328
so how to get that decision right
is extremely important.

00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:24.051
There are many different aspects
of that decision we could discuss,

00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:25.407
we could talk, for example,

00:01:25.407 --> 00:01:28.717
about how to know
when you've met the right person.

00:01:28.717 --> 00:01:30.926
But because it's a big
and complicated subject,

00:01:30.926 --> 00:01:33.741
I'm going to focus just
on one aspect in the short time

00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:35.524
I've got to talk to you today.

00:01:35.524 --> 00:01:39.734
And that aspect is going to be:
how to seduce.

00:01:39.744 --> 00:01:44.352
Or to put it in more common
British parlance: how to pull.

00:01:44.352 --> 00:01:46.062
(Laughter)

00:01:46.062 --> 00:01:48.736
I became interested in the subject
as a psychiatrist,

00:01:48.736 --> 00:01:51.786
when I had a moment
of epiphany in a clinic.

00:01:51.786 --> 00:01:55.493
I was working in the outpatient department
at my psychiatric hospital,

00:01:55.493 --> 00:01:58.366
I was consulting with a young lady
who was pretty depressed,

00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:01.876
and all of a sudden, she announced
in the middle of the consultation:

00:02:01.876 --> 00:02:07.494
'Dr Persaud, I don't need Prozac,
I need a boyfriend.'

00:02:08.354 --> 00:02:13.204
It was at that moment that I realized
that more success in relationships

00:02:13.204 --> 00:02:16.636
would go a long way
to improving people's happiness.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:20.459
That if we could help people
improve their relationships

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.172
and how they conduct relationships,

00:02:22.172 --> 00:02:25.432
it would go a long way
to improving their mental health.

00:02:25.432 --> 00:02:28.709
Hence, I got interested
in the science of seduction.

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.559
Now it's very important you understand

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:32.872
that my interest
in the science of seduction

00:02:32.872 --> 00:02:37.259
is purely academic, clinical, scientific.

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:39.815
I have no personal interest
in this subject.

00:02:39.815 --> 00:02:43.132
Indeed, before I came this evening
to give you this talk,

00:02:43.132 --> 00:02:46.059
my wife said it's very important
that you make sure

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:49.522
that they don't think
you're some kind of academic geek

00:02:49.522 --> 00:02:51.908
who started reading
about the science of seduction

00:02:51.908 --> 00:02:55.707
because you found the whole
relationship thing kind of puzzling.

00:02:56.367 --> 00:02:58.667
When the publishers
rang me up for the first time

00:02:58.667 --> 00:03:01.429
to ask me to write
my first book on seduction,

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:03.459
I rang my wife, I was very excited.

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.003
I said, 'Darling, the publishers
have just rung me up,

00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:07.586
and they have commissioned me

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:12.276
to write the very next book
they want to publish on how to seduce.'

00:03:12.866 --> 00:03:17.094
There was a distinct silence
down the line, and then my wife said,

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:19.326
'Yes, but why you?'

00:03:19.326 --> 00:03:21.683
(Laughter)

00:03:21.683 --> 00:03:24.564
Which I thought was somewhat harsh.

00:03:24.564 --> 00:03:27.212
The other reason why I think
seduction is very important

00:03:27.212 --> 00:03:30.942
is that it actually goes to the heart
of a huge amount of human happiness.

00:03:30.942 --> 00:03:33.267
You see, people come to me at my clinic,

00:03:33.267 --> 00:03:36.772
and they tell me all about the things
they want from life and the world

00:03:36.772 --> 00:03:38.255
that they are not getting.

00:03:38.255 --> 00:03:39.648
And they are very frustrated.

00:03:39.648 --> 00:03:42.676
They may want a date,
they may want a Ferrari in their garage,

00:03:42.676 --> 00:03:45.326
or they may want a million pounds
in their bank account.

00:03:45.326 --> 00:03:48.426
They always tell me what they want
and what they're not getting.

00:03:48.426 --> 00:03:50.093
What they don't tell me

00:03:50.093 --> 00:03:54.343
is what they need to give
in order to get what they want.

00:03:54.343 --> 00:03:57.394
You see, at the heart of life
is a transaction.

00:03:57.394 --> 00:04:00.149
You can get what you want
from the world and life,

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:02.725
but you have to be able to give something

00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:05.723
that the world wants
and you need to give it first.

00:04:05.723 --> 00:04:07.683
I'm going to let you into a little secret

00:04:07.683 --> 00:04:10.403
that all of the most highly effective
people on the planet

00:04:10.403 --> 00:04:13.410
already intuitively know, and that is,

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.161
life is a seduction.

00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:18.514
We need to seduce the world
and the people in it

00:04:18.514 --> 00:04:22.453
and seduce life into giving us
the things that we want.

00:04:22.453 --> 00:04:24.452
And in order to seduce successfully,

00:04:24.452 --> 00:04:28.037
we need to make the world the right offer.

00:04:28.037 --> 00:04:29.465
You see, in a general sense,

00:04:29.465 --> 00:04:32.985
we need to be constantly seducing
our friends, our lovers as well,

00:04:32.985 --> 00:04:37.932
but our work colleagues, in a strictly
perhaps not erotic sense of the word,

00:04:37.932 --> 00:04:42.073
but we need to be seducing them
into giving us the things that we want.

00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:45.259
Now, I know already many of you
are going to be a bit disappointed,

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.409
you were sitting there hoping
I was going to give you some hot tips

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:49.616
on how to seduce

00:04:49.616 --> 00:04:54.076
in terms of more narrow erotic
sense of the word 'seduction'.

00:04:54.076 --> 00:04:55.228
Well, the good news is,

00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:58.452
yes, some of the tips
I'm about to give you will be helpful

00:04:58.452 --> 00:05:00.242
if you came here focused

00:05:00.242 --> 00:05:03.282
on the more narrow erotic sense
of the word seduction.

00:05:03.742 --> 00:05:06.309
The bad news is,
if you have been sitting here

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:09.474
really locked in and focused in
on getting some hot tips

00:05:09.474 --> 00:05:13.464
on how to seduce in the more
narrow erotic sense of the word,

00:05:13.464 --> 00:05:16.360
well, that says so much about you.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.391
(Laughter)

00:05:18.391 --> 00:05:21.559
So the other thing I want to say
before I finally reveal these tips

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:24.549
is what I like about them
is how democratic they are.

00:05:24.558 --> 00:05:28.288
What they kind of say is that anyone
can become more seductive.

00:05:28.305 --> 00:05:31.766
It doesn't really matter how hot you look
or how cool you are.

00:05:31.766 --> 00:05:34.794
I find that most people
seem to have rather low self-esteem

00:05:34.794 --> 00:05:36.147
when it comes to seduction.

00:05:36.147 --> 00:05:38.717
They kind of think,
I can't be really seductive.

00:05:38.717 --> 00:05:41.947
What's really amazing about the social
psychology of seduction is

00:05:41.947 --> 00:05:45.143
what it says is,
anyone can become more seductive,

00:05:45.143 --> 00:05:47.493
and indeed, some of these tips
are so powerful

00:05:47.493 --> 00:05:51.389
you can leap ahead of even
the hottest person that you know

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.405
or the coolest member
of your social group

00:05:53.405 --> 00:05:56.075
and become more seductive than them.

00:05:56.957 --> 00:06:02.437
So, the first tip comes from a really
interesting social psychology experiment.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.358
In the social psychology experiment,
the social psychologist,

00:06:05.358 --> 00:06:07.672
an academic working
in the university department,

00:06:07.672 --> 00:06:11.290
recruits some students
to be confederates of the experimenter.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.938
He sends the students out on a date,

00:06:13.938 --> 00:06:16.441
they invite people to come
on a date with a student.

00:06:16.441 --> 00:06:19.921
The person invited to come on the date
thinks it's just a date,

00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:23.312
but actually, there's a social
psychology experiment going on.

00:06:23.312 --> 00:06:25.630
The social psychologist
instructs the student,

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.675
who is the confederate
of the experimenter,

00:06:27.675 --> 00:06:29.415
to, throughout the date,

00:06:29.415 --> 00:06:32.885
agree with everything
the other person is saying.

00:06:32.885 --> 00:06:34.072
Then at the end of date,

00:06:34.072 --> 00:06:37.314
it's revealed that there was
a social psychology experiment going on,

00:06:37.314 --> 00:06:39.878
and a rating is secured

00:06:39.878 --> 00:06:42.968
for how attractive
the student confederate was found,

00:06:42.968 --> 00:06:45.458
given how they behaved during the date.

00:06:45.885 --> 00:06:49.353
In the first condition of the experiment,
the student confederate goes out

00:06:49.353 --> 00:06:53.283
and just agrees with everything
the other person says on the date,

00:06:53.283 --> 00:06:55.503
and an attraction rating
is secured in the end,

00:06:55.503 --> 00:06:58.763
and people are found
moderately attractive in that condition.

00:06:58.763 --> 00:07:00.898
In the second condition of the experiment,

00:07:00.898 --> 00:07:03.278
the student confederate
is sent out on the date

00:07:03.287 --> 00:07:08.047
and is instructed to disagree
with everything the other person says.

00:07:08.047 --> 00:07:10.838
So it goes a bit like this:
'I really like this restaurant.

00:07:10.838 --> 00:07:13.543
So lovely, what do you think?'
'No, I don't like it.'

00:07:13.543 --> 00:07:14.545
(Laughter)

00:07:14.545 --> 00:07:16.973
'This fish was rather nice,
don't you think?'

00:07:16.973 --> 00:07:18.313
'No, I don't like it.'

00:07:19.287 --> 00:07:22.408
It comes as no surprise
if you spend the whole date doing that,

00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:24.833
disagreeing with everything
the other person says,

00:07:24.833 --> 00:07:28.064
you're not really found
very attractive at all.

00:07:28.064 --> 00:07:29.750
So far, so obvious.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.498
Now, the third condition of the experiment
is where things get really interesting.

00:07:34.868 --> 00:07:38.173
In the third experiment,
the student confederate is sent out

00:07:38.173 --> 00:07:42.061
with the instruction to spend
the first half of the date

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:44.708
disagreeing with everything
the other person says,

00:07:44.708 --> 00:07:48.618
and then to switch and start agreeing
for the second half of the date.

00:07:49.417 --> 00:07:51.216
And amazingly enough,

00:07:51.216 --> 00:07:55.279
you're found most attractive of all
in this condition.

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:56.849
Now why is that?

00:07:56.849 --> 00:07:59.717
There's rather some complex
psychological theories going on

00:07:59.717 --> 00:08:02.306
as to what's going on,
so I'm going to cut to the chase

00:08:02.306 --> 00:08:05.627
and give you what I think is
the most profound and important theory.

00:08:05.627 --> 00:08:07.371
You see the other person on the date

00:08:07.371 --> 00:08:11.443
didn't realize there was a Machiavellian
manipulative plot of thought,

00:08:11.443 --> 00:08:14.364
whereby you were watching
for the clock to hit a certain time,

00:08:14.364 --> 00:08:15.927
and then you're going to switch.

00:08:15.927 --> 00:08:17.477
What their experience of you was

00:08:17.477 --> 00:08:20.357
that you were rather difficult
in the first half of the date,

00:08:20.357 --> 00:08:22.201
and then you warmed up to them.

00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:25.085
And they think they had an impact on you.

00:08:25.085 --> 00:08:27.351
They think they warmed you up.

00:08:27.351 --> 00:08:30.126
And there is something
about having an impact

00:08:30.126 --> 00:08:31.946
which is very seductive.

00:08:31.946 --> 00:08:34.057
There are many objections
to this experiment.

00:08:34.057 --> 00:08:35.057
People always say,

00:08:35.057 --> 00:08:37.848
'I can see that's seductive,
but you're playing a game.

00:08:37.848 --> 00:08:40.618
Why can't we just be ourselves?'

00:08:40.761 --> 00:08:44.311
Well, you can just
be yourself if you want,

00:08:44.311 --> 00:08:45.945
but be aware of something,

00:08:45.945 --> 00:08:48.105
which is that there are
many people out there

00:08:48.105 --> 00:08:50.123
that are playing the game of life,

00:08:50.123 --> 00:08:52.344
and they are playing it rather hard.

00:08:52.344 --> 00:08:55.338
And as a result,
they are terrifically successful.

00:08:55.338 --> 00:08:57.199
They are really good in job interviews,

00:08:57.199 --> 00:08:59.959
and they're very good
as politicians at getting elected.

00:09:00.279 --> 00:09:03.224
So if you are not going to play
the game of life, that's fine,

00:09:03.224 --> 00:09:05.919
but be aware that you
might run into trouble

00:09:05.919 --> 00:09:08.559
if everyone else
is playing the game of life.

00:09:09.539 --> 00:09:11.130
The other important idea here is

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.350
that we can divide relationships
into three key phases:

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:17.175
attention, interest, and maintenance.

00:09:17.175 --> 00:09:20.571
You walk into a bar,
you see a very attractive person, 'Wow!'

00:09:21.461 --> 00:09:23.201
They've got your attention.

00:09:23.201 --> 00:09:25.467
Hopefully, you've got their attention.

00:09:25.467 --> 00:09:27.927
Then you go over and talk to them,
get to know them,

00:09:27.927 --> 00:09:29.825
and you're entering the interest phase.

00:09:29.825 --> 00:09:32.290
Then, maybe after a few days or weeks,

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.570
you might transition
into the maintenance phase,

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.928
which is a long-term commitment.

00:09:36.928 --> 00:09:39.859
Now, the key point about this idea

00:09:39.859 --> 00:09:44.465
is that different skills are required
depending on which phase you're in.

00:09:44.465 --> 00:09:47.665
It's a profoundly important social
psychological model

00:09:47.665 --> 00:09:50.242
in terms of getting a handle on
and understanding

00:09:50.242 --> 00:09:54.908
business relationships, friendships,
and of course, romantic seductions.

00:09:54.908 --> 00:09:58.575
Even if you want to reject the attention,
interest, and maintenance phase,

00:09:58.575 --> 00:10:00.054
it is a very powerful model.

00:10:00.054 --> 00:10:01.693
We all know people who we think:

00:10:01.693 --> 00:10:04.593
'This is a wonderful person,
how come they are single?'

00:10:04.593 --> 00:10:07.206
Well, maybe they
are very good at maintenance,

00:10:07.206 --> 00:10:10.424
and they are not so good at
attention or interest.

00:10:10.424 --> 00:10:13.178
So the model is really helpful
in diagnosing problems

00:10:13.178 --> 00:10:14.768
in terms of seduction.

00:10:14.768 --> 00:10:17.371
Another point I want to make is,
even if you end up

00:10:17.371 --> 00:10:20.184
in a long-term committed relationship
doing maintenance,

00:10:20.184 --> 00:10:24.144
if your relationship is going
to be successful and last 40 or 50 years,

00:10:24.144 --> 00:10:28.626
I believe you've got to cycle back through
attention, interest, and maintenance.

00:10:28.626 --> 00:10:30.728
You're going to be
constantly cycling through

00:10:30.728 --> 00:10:32.262
in a long-term relationship,

00:10:32.262 --> 00:10:36.252
getting your partner's attention again,

00:10:36.252 --> 00:10:38.062
getting them interested again in you.

00:10:38.062 --> 00:10:42.990
And that constant cycling means that life
and even long-term committed relationships

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:45.510
are a long-term seduction.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.969
Life is a seduction,

00:10:46.969 --> 00:10:49.959
even long-term marriages
are a constant seduction.

00:10:49.959 --> 00:10:52.312
And the attention, interest,
and maintenance model

00:10:52.312 --> 00:10:55.190
is really helpful in understanding that.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:11:00.380
Perhaps the most expert exponent
of attention, interest, and maintenance

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.853
was Casanova.

00:11:02.493 --> 00:11:05.661
Not least because Casanova
was brilliant at attention and interest,

00:11:05.661 --> 00:11:07.927
but really bad at maintenance.

00:11:08.435 --> 00:11:11.439
Casanova was a real figure,
he lived in the 18th century Venice,

00:11:11.439 --> 00:11:14.769
he was an adventurer and a nobleman,
and is said to be, perhaps,

00:11:14.769 --> 00:11:17.627
the most successful seducer
of women in history.

00:11:17.627 --> 00:11:20.267
And he's got the final tip
I want to give you

00:11:20.267 --> 00:11:22.731
at the heart of the secret of seduction.

00:11:23.368 --> 00:11:24.639
You see, many people think

00:11:24.639 --> 00:11:27.909
that Casanova would walk into a bar
in the 18th century Venice,

00:11:27.909 --> 00:11:31.487
see an attractive member
of the opposite sex, and pull like that.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:33.970
But actually, that's not true.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.784
He would walk into a bar
and see an attractive woman,

00:11:36.784 --> 00:11:39.406
but then spend many months courting her,

00:11:39.406 --> 00:11:43.528
as was the courtly custom of the day,
before being finally successful.

00:11:43.528 --> 00:11:46.194
And there is, by the way,
an important lesson for us all.

00:11:46.194 --> 00:11:49.194
If you go into a bar tonight,
and pull like that,

00:11:49.194 --> 00:11:52.234
I'm afraid to tell you
that's not really a seduction.

00:11:52.864 --> 00:11:54.644
A seduction is when you meet someone

00:11:54.644 --> 00:11:57.424
who is disinterested in you,
or only moderately interested,

00:11:57.424 --> 00:12:01.047
and you convert
that interest into rabid desire.

00:12:01.595 --> 00:12:03.195
That's a seduction.

00:12:03.195 --> 00:12:06.863
And the problem with the modern world,
and websites, Tinder and Apps

00:12:06.863 --> 00:12:10.503
is that it's kind of doing away
with the whole seduction idea,

00:12:10.503 --> 00:12:15.379
and we are losing the skill of seduction
with very ominous social implications,

00:12:15.379 --> 00:12:16.490
in my opinion.

00:12:17.154 --> 00:12:19.949
The story is that Casanova
walks into a bar one night,

00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:23.749
sees a gorgeous woman, she's an actress,
physically very desirable,

00:12:23.749 --> 00:12:26.906
falls immediately
in love with her, desires her.

00:12:27.312 --> 00:12:30.013
The actress, besides being
physically stunning,

00:12:30.013 --> 00:12:31.666
has an interesting characteristic.

00:12:31.666 --> 00:12:34.089
You see, she has
a speech impediment, a lisp.

00:12:34.089 --> 00:12:38.609
She can't say words properly
that have the letter R in them.

00:12:38.609 --> 00:12:41.540
Many of you will know
a famous TV presenter here in Britain

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.376
called Jonathan Ross,
whose nickname is Wossy,

00:12:44.376 --> 00:12:46.406
who has a very similar speech impediment.

00:12:46.406 --> 00:12:49.321
He can't say words properly
that have the letter R.

00:12:49.321 --> 00:12:51.561
She has this speech impediment.

00:12:51.561 --> 00:12:53.777
Without really interacting
with the actress,

00:12:53.777 --> 00:12:55.471
Casanova turns on his heels,

00:12:55.471 --> 00:12:57.991
goes home and does a mysterious thing.

00:12:57.991 --> 00:13:01.888
He spends the next
three days and nights writing a play.

00:13:01.888 --> 00:13:05.383
And this play has a very special feature.

00:13:05.383 --> 00:13:08.243
It has no words in it with the letter R.

00:13:08.669 --> 00:13:11.379
Three days and nights later,
he returns to the bar,

00:13:11.379 --> 00:13:13.388
presents the play to the actress,

00:13:13.388 --> 00:13:15.793
and the seduction is successful.

00:13:15.793 --> 00:13:18.831
But here is my pop quiz
psychology question for you,

00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:21.633
you see, what Casanova could've done,

00:13:21.633 --> 00:13:23.117
he could have said

00:13:23.117 --> 00:13:26.377
'I can't help noticing you've got
a bit of a speech impediment there.

00:13:26.377 --> 00:13:27.637
Tell you what,

00:13:27.637 --> 00:13:31.518
I'll pay for elocution lessons,
I'll buy you speech therapy.'

00:13:32.028 --> 00:13:33.858
No one can deny that speech therapy

00:13:33.858 --> 00:13:36.608
is more pragmatically helpful
to the poor actress

00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:40.358
than a play that has no words in it
with the letter R.

00:13:40.358 --> 00:13:43.962
However, it's the play
that's the seductive move.

00:13:43.962 --> 00:13:47.493
It's the play that's sexy. Why is that?

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:49.339
Well, let's look at between the lines.

00:13:49.339 --> 00:13:52.708
What you are really saying
when you offer someone speech therapy is,

00:13:52.708 --> 00:13:54.088
what you are saying is,

00:13:54.088 --> 00:13:57.453
'There is something wrong
with you, it needs fixing.

00:13:57.453 --> 00:14:00.993
After it's fixed, then I'll have
a relationship with you.'

00:14:00.993 --> 00:14:02.957
That's not a very sexy message.

00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:05.019
But, guess what?

00:14:05.019 --> 00:14:08.299
It's kind of what we're saying
to a lot of people, a lot of the time.

00:14:08.299 --> 00:14:11.381
What does the play with no words
with the letter R say?

00:14:11.381 --> 00:14:16.240
What it says is, 'Don't change a thing! 
You're perfect as you are.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:22.371
And my job is to help the world recognise
the perfection that I see.'

00:14:22.371 --> 00:14:24.301
That's a sexy message!

00:14:24.751 --> 00:14:26.648
The other thing the play does is this.

00:14:26.648 --> 00:14:28.147
It's terrifically specific,

00:14:28.147 --> 00:14:31.831
the actress knows that Casanova
is interested specifically in her.

00:14:31.831 --> 00:14:35.143
A lot of young men going on a date,
nip into the petrol station

00:14:35.143 --> 00:14:37.153
because they've left at the last minute,

00:14:37.153 --> 00:14:38.700
buy some petrol station flowers,

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.999
present the petrol station flowers
to their date with a grand gesture,

00:14:41.999 --> 00:14:45.359
and are somewhat perplexed
that the date is less than overwhelmed

00:14:45.359 --> 00:14:47.880
with the presentation
of petrol station flowers.

00:14:48.341 --> 00:14:52.350
You see, you can't go to a petrol station
and buy a play off the self

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.420
that has no words in it with the letter R.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:59.432
The actress knows that Casanova
was interested in her and no one else.

00:14:59.432 --> 00:15:00.652
It's specific.

00:15:01.133 --> 00:15:04.723
But here is the final point
and the most profound message

00:15:04.723 --> 00:15:07.315
in terms of the psychology of seduction.

00:15:07.315 --> 00:15:09.667
What Casanova has done brilliantly

00:15:09.667 --> 00:15:12.374
is, and here is the key catchphrase
you need to remember:

00:15:12.374 --> 00:15:14.788
he's filled the unmet need.

00:15:14.788 --> 00:15:19.773
The actress has an unmet need for parts
that have no words with the letter R,

00:15:19.773 --> 00:15:22.993
and Casanova diagnoses the unmet need,

00:15:22.993 --> 00:15:26.791
and meets it more completely
than it's ever been met before.

00:15:26.791 --> 00:15:29.959
If you find someone's unmet need

00:15:29.959 --> 00:15:32.832
and fill it in a way
it's never been filled before,

00:15:32.832 --> 00:15:35.965
you will be successful in seducing them.

00:15:35.965 --> 00:15:39.155
So your mission is a two-pronged attack.

00:15:39.155 --> 00:15:41.268
You've got to find out the unmet need,

00:15:41.268 --> 00:15:44.577
and then you have to fill it
in a way that's never been filled before.

00:15:44.577 --> 00:15:47.287
I can sense immediately
that you have a lot of questions.

00:15:47.287 --> 00:15:49.879
'How do we find out the unmet need?
How do we fill it?'

00:15:49.879 --> 00:15:51.754
And I apologize I've I run out of time,

00:15:51.754 --> 00:15:54.524
so I won't be able
to answer those questions.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:58.282
But ... is it possible
that leaving you wanting more

00:15:58.282 --> 00:16:00.138
is a kind of seduction?

00:16:00.138 --> 00:16:01.467
Thank you very much.

00:16:01.467 --> 00:16:04.507
(Applauses) (Cheers)
