00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.640
- Hi, it's me, Tim Dodd,
the Everyday Astronaut.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.650
If you've ever seen footage
of a SpaceX rocket launch,

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.390
perhaps you've noticed
a strange phenomenon,

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.630
when the rocket leaves the
launch pad, it's white,

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.010
but when it comes back down from space

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.190
all of a sudden it's half
black and half white,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.300
and it has these really
well defined sections

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.710
of black and white.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.920
So what the heck is happening?

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.250
What causes this?

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.849
Today I'm going to explain
just what exactly causes

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.160
this phenomenon and then we're actually

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.210
going to try to recreate it ourselves.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.033
And no, it's not just because
I wanted to play with fire.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.140
Anyway, let's get started.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.107
- [Announcer] Three, two, one, zero.

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:42.683
We have lift-off.
(upbeat music)

00:00:42.683 --> 00:00:45.350
That's one small step for man...

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.267
- Isn't it crazy that it's
been less than three years

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:54.400
since we first saw a Falcon 9 rocket land

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.840
for the first time back on Earth?

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.640
I still remember watching
OG2 on December 21st, 2015

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.413
with my friends, and my cat.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.510
(cheering)

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.380
When SpaceX landed their
first Falcon 9 booster,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.390
I couldn't wait to see what
it actually looked like

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.940
when a rocket came back from space.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.180
The next morning pictures
started flowing in

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.720
from launch photographers
and from SpaceX themselves.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.950
There it was.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.450
A Falcon 9 on the landing
pad only a few kilometers

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.880
away from where it took off from

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.420
at Cape Canaveral Air
Force Station in Florida.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.830
Just as soon as the pictures came back,

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.290
the questions started rolling in.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.570
Why is it now half black and half white

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.960
with a very distinct line between the two?

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.890
Are there a bunch of
aliens at the edge of space

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.020
waiting for rockets to fly by
so they can spray paint 'em?

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.660
Alright, so let's first
start off by figuring out why

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.270
the Falcon 9 and Falcon
Heavy boosters come back

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.500
with any black on it at all,
and then we'll figure out

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.960
why there's such a distinct line

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.315
where it is and isn't black.

00:01:59.315 --> 00:02:02.148
(uplifting music)

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:14.530
And the answer is, soot.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.710
The reason the Falcon 9
and Falcon Heavy boosters

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.990
come back so dirty is
literally the exact same reason

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.075
why your chimney is dirty or
why the tailpipe of your car

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:27.560
might be dirty, well, unless
you own an electric car

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.070
and you don't have a tail pipe.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.870
The Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy burn

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.520
a mixture of RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.350
RP-1 is a very common form of rocket fuel

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.120
and it's basically just
highly refined jet fuel,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.410
which itself is just a
highly refined kerosene.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.510
When kerosene or any other
carbon based fuel is burned,

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.180
say gasoline, diesel, coal or even wood,

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.460
it produces airborne
impure carbon particles.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.440
It's actually the result of the process

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.750
of thermal decomposition of
materials known as pyrolysis.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.720
We've all seen the black
smoke come out of a semi-truck

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.560
when they're under high loads,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.920
or perhaps a little black
smoke coming off of a candle.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.070
Well the Falcon family of rockets

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.620
actually produce virtually
the exact same thing.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.690
And I know what you're thinking,

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.930
doesn't this go against Elon
Musk's green initiatives?

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.923
Well, I'll get into that in a future video

00:03:17.923 --> 00:03:20.920
where we look at the total
carbon output of rockets

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.070
and what technology can
help curb their pollution.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.900
Okay, so, back to soot.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.650
On ascent, as a rocket
accelerates forward,

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.390
the exhaust goes the
exact opposite direction,

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.550
literally throwing the soot
far away from the vehicle.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.080
This is why on ascent, the rockets

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.260
maintain their beautiful exteriors.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.350
But that's only one half of the story

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.050
of a Falcon 9 or Falcon Heavy boosters.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.990
After the booster performs
the work of getting

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.014
the second stage well
on its way into orbit,

00:03:47.014 --> 00:03:50.550
the booster has to get
ready for its next feat.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.413
And this is no small feat.

00:03:52.413 --> 00:03:54.680
Regardless of where
the booster is landing,

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.850
whether it be a return
to launch site landing

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.900
or if it's following
its ballistic trajectory

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.280
and landing out in the
ocean on the drone ship,

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.980
it will need to scrub off velocity

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.540
before it re-enters the atmosphere.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.700
If it doesn't do this,
the heat from re-entry

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.780
will literally rip it apart.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.716
So in order to survive
re-entry the Falcon 9

00:04:11.716 --> 00:04:14.320
lights up three of its nine Merlin engines

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.550
for approximately 30 seconds or so

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.190
to cut its velocity up to 50%!

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.340
And here's where things get dirty.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.460
The booster is re-entering
through its own exhaust plume

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.300
since the rocket re-enters engines first.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.270
So now, all that exhaust
winds up depositing

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.450
a large amount of soot on the booster.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.810
We can actually see a
pretty drastic difference

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.690
from before re-entry to after re-entry.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.570
As if that one burn wasn't
enough, a few minutes later,

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.350
it actually performs one final burn

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.320
to perform its propulsive landing.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.540
Sometimes this utilizes
three engines again, but most

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.360
of the time only one engine
performs the landing burn.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.290
But nevertheless, it's
again a pretty messy event.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.454
Once the booster lands,
and the smoke clears,

00:04:56.454 --> 00:04:58.450
we can now get a pretty good glimpse

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.743
of just what exactly the
booster went through.

00:05:00.743 --> 00:05:03.926
And here's where our
next question comes in.

00:05:03.926 --> 00:05:06.370
What's with the sections that are white?

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.400
How can that be?

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.170
Pretty quickly, we might spot

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.270
why there's some white still
at the bottom of the rocket.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.350
See those nice V-shaped white sections,

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.600
those are where the
landing legs were tucked up

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.930
against the fuselage during ascent

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.500
and the majority of descent.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.840
The legs don't deploy
until just a few seconds

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.620
before touchdown, at which
point some pneumatic pushers

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.680
begin to unfold the legs,
and then a collet locks

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.980
them in place once they're
at their full extension.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.700
Pre-Block 5 boosters,
or any Falcon booster

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.090
flown before May, 2018,
had white landing legs.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.207
All Block 5 boosters that
we see now start off black.

00:05:41.207 --> 00:05:45.000
Back on the pre-Block 5
boosters, we could easily see

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.870
the outside legs changing
from white to black,

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.670
leaving the fuselage
underneath nice and clean!

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.900
Okay, so that explains that section,

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.813
but what about that horizontal
line just above that?

00:05:56.813 --> 00:05:59.000
Now here's where this gets fun!

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.840
Remember those two things the Falcon 9

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.940
and Falcon Heavy use as propellant?

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.070
Liquid oxygen and RP-1?

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.860
Well there's your next clue.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.510
SpaceX super chills their
propellants to maximize

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.400
their density and increase
performance of the rockets.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.392
This means they chill the
RP-1 and the liquid oxygen

00:06:15.392 --> 00:06:18.460
more than any other operational rocket.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.300
So SpaceX took their RP-1 from
basically room temperature

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.390
at 21 degrees celsius down to
minus seven degrees celsius.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.980
Ugh, brrr.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.540
But that's actually nothing
compared to the liquid oxygen.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.020
In order for oxygen to exist as a liquid

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.930
as opposed to the gas we're
more used to it being,

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.130
it already needs to be extremely cold

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.100
but SpaceX continues to chill
it until it's almost a solid.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.770
Oxygen becomes a liquid at
minus 183 degrees celsius

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.260
and a solid at minus 219 degrees celsius.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.870
SpaceX chills their liquid
oxygen all the way down

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.710
to minus 207 degrees celsius.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.410
Our next clue is actually the
most visible as the vehicle

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.600
is being fueled up on the launch
pad right before lift off.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.960
Notice all the condensation
rolling off the rocket?

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.810
That's water vapor in
the air coming in contact

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.290
with the super cold aluminum skin

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.580
housing the cryogenic propellant below.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.080
Just like how a cold soda can will quickly

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.470
get large droplets of
water on the outside of it

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.920
in a humid environment,
rockets go a step further.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.776
All that water doesn't turn into droplets,

00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:27.600
some of it comes in contact
with the fuselage and freezes.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.560
This creates a good amount of ice build up

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.830
on the outside of the vehicle.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.520
Some rockets have insulation
to help prevent the build up

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.520
of ice from occurring, but
more importantly to prevent

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.880
the propellant inside from
warming up and boiling off.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.680
This is most commonly seen in rockets

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.170
that use liquid hydrogen as
fuel, which is much cooler

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.810
than liquid oxygen and
boils off much easier.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.240
Therefore we see
insulated tanks on rockets

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.550
like the the Delta IV,
the external fuel tank

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.950
of the Space Shuttle,
or even the Saturn V.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.245
But my favorite solution
for having insulation

00:07:57.245 --> 00:08:00.760
to prevent boil off, that
doesn't add extra weight

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.034
associated with foam insulation
is on the Minotaur rocket

00:08:04.034 --> 00:08:07.430
which is sometimes known
as the banana rocket.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.298
It has an insulation on it during fuel up

00:08:09.298 --> 00:08:11.464
that peels off on ascent.

00:08:11.464 --> 00:08:14.900
Yes, that's so ridiculous.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.936
I just hope no one slips
on it during pad clean up.

00:08:17.936 --> 00:08:19.753
(drum beating)

00:08:19.753 --> 00:08:22.350
Back to the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.890
It doesn't use spray on
insulation or a banana peel.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.490
Instead most of the
ice falls off in sheets

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.070
right after lift off.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.540
Due to the rocket being white,

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.250
it's hard to actually
spot the ice build up.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.960
Bit there is a rocket
that's really easy to spot

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.220
where there's ice on it

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.800
and that's Rocket Lab's Electron rocket

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.604
which is entirely made
out of black carbon fiber.

00:08:43.604 --> 00:08:47.180
Despite it being an entirely black rocket,

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.020
once it's fully fueled it suddenly looks

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.550
like an entirely different rocket!

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.050
How crazy is that?

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.740
It's so easy to spot where
the liquid oxygen tanks are

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.950
and where the RP-1 tanks
are on the Electron.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:01.130
So now finally, we have
all the puzzle pieces

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:01.990
for our answer!

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:03.940
That same sheet of ice that covers

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.630
the liquid oxygen tanks during ascent

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:09.360
is still fairly prevalent
on the rocket on descent.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.116
It might not be as thick,
but it does provide a surface

00:09:12.116 --> 00:09:14.190
that's harder for the soot to stick to.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.580
Therefore, we see little to no soot

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.510
on the base of the oxygen tank,

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.250
providing a crisp line
between the oxygen tank

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:22.440
and the RP-1 tank.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.050
Since the cold oxygen sits
at the bottom of the tank

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:26.960
which is now almost empty,

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.140
we have the most ice at the bottom,

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.480
which explains why the booster

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.250
actually gets gray again up top.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.630
Two fun notes here.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.040
All the current generation
Block 5 Falcon 9's

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.860
come back quite a bit less
sooty due to a new coating

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.082
on the paint that provides
more thermal protection

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:44.712
and is harder for the soot to stick to.

00:09:44.712 --> 00:09:47.060
SpaceX also cleverly changed the position

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.074
of the SpaceX logo to the oxygen tank.

00:09:50.074 --> 00:09:53.030
This little trick is amazing,
because now you can actually

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.630
still see the logo
after the booster lands,

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:59.190
unlike previously landed boosters
whose logos were so hidden

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.880
in the soot you couldn't see
it by the time it landed.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.060
Okay, and now for something
fun, we're actually going

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.010
to see if we can recreate this phenomenon

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:09.950
using some aluminum, some
dry ice and some kerosene.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:11.870
Okay, time to play with some fire.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:14.667
So, I have here some aluminum
that I painted white.

00:10:14.667 --> 00:10:17.030
That's going to go over
the top of this cup

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:20.030
in this little thing here, so
that the ice will sit on top,

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.920
the dry ice will sit right on top of this.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.650
And we'll have that nice
clean separation between

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:25.360
the sections that are really cold

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.350
and the sections that are not,

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:30.210
just like the oxygen tanks
and the liquid fuel tanks.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.692
Then we have some dry ice that,
although it's really cold,

00:10:32.692 --> 00:10:35.130
it's quite a bit warmer
than liquid oxygen.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:40.130
It's minus 78 degrees celsius
and liquid oxygen is actually,

00:10:40.407 --> 00:10:43.180
SpaceX cools it down to
minus 207 degrees celsius.

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:44.510
So this is quite a bit
cooler but hopefully

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.900
it does the trick to at least,

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.850
help us get some kind of ice
barrier around the outside.

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:52.810
We have a very shoddily made,
homemade kerosene candle

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.150
that's going to produce a lot of soot.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.100
That's it's only job is
to make a lot of soot

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.630
because that's what we're
trying to demonstrate here.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:01.100
And this is a spray bottle
with some water in it.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.783
And we're going to spray
the outside of this

00:11:02.783 --> 00:11:05.901
a little bit to help add a
little bit of extra frost

00:11:05.901 --> 00:11:08.150
some kind of extra ice layer.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.330
So, let's get started.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.010
So, first things first,
let's go ahead and stick

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.630
this aluminum over the top of this cup.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.700
There we go, just like that.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.530
Let's put on our official safety gloves.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.970
These are NASA certified,

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.570
not-at-all-certified safety gloves.

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:26.800
So I need to get a bunch of this,

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.280
as much of this as I can inside of here.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.580
Okay you can already see

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:35.600
there's a small amount of
water vapor on the outside

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.600
that's condensing into a
little bit of frost here.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.143
You can just barely tell.

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:44.350
But we're gonna let that actually

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:45.690
get cold there for a second.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:46.950
And actually maybe I'll start spraying

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.913
a little bit of water here, very lightly.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.060
Just so maybe that sticks to the outside.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.600
Okay, I think it's time
we light this candle here

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.210
and we're going to see if
we can get a bunch of soot

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.960
cover the aluminum and then hopefully,

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.130
we'll see where it sticks
and where it doesn't stick.

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.863
Don't try this at home, this
is a very shoddily made candle.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.995
But, it's going to again do the job,

00:12:12.995 --> 00:12:16.570
hopefully creating a lot of soot.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.020
So now I think we've got
a pretty good sense here

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:22.943
of where that would be.

00:12:22.943 --> 00:12:25.410
I'm going to put this fire out here.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:27.110
Just starve it of oxygen quick.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:32.010
So what happens if we
let this actually thaw,

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:33.470
will it take some of the soot with it?

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.510
So let's go ahead and try and remove

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:42.083
the aluminum from the dry ice.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.070
And let's kind of wash it down quick

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.523
and see if we get that nice line.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.663
Well, look at that.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.393
That line looks pretty familiar to me.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:00.830
So, it looks like where
the ice barrier was

00:13:03.173 --> 00:13:05.820
the soot didn't stick to it.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.420
But, where there wasn't an ice barrier

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.490
the soot did stick to it.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.750
That looks just about like the line.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.660
And again, that'd be a
lot, a lot, a lot stronger

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:15.800
if we were using liquid oxygen.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.225
There'd be a much thicker ice barrier,

00:13:17.225 --> 00:13:19.790
a lot more protective.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:24.010
But that's actually pretty darn good.

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:25.450
Look at that!

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:26.400
Huh.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.070
So how'd we do?

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.380
Let me know if you have
any other questions

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.894
about why a Falcon 9 goes
up white and comes back

00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:33.950
black and white or any other questions

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.550
about Falcon 9s and Falcon Heavys

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.350
