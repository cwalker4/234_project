00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.680
Hey! In this video, I'm going
to show you the Top 10 foods that does NOT

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.380
affect your blood sugar. These are both healthy,
beneficial and of course perfect for people

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.090
with both types of Diabetes.\
\

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.779
Before we get started I just wanted to share
a quick little tip for you who are just starting

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.949
out with eating healthier and different and
that have a hard time getting rid of all the

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:27.749
carbohydrates. A great thing with protein
and fat is that it slows down the conversion

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:32.739
from food to blood sugar which means if you're
still eating carbohydrates -even though I

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.019
recommend trying to get rid of as much as
possible- you can add fat and protein to your

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:43.890
meal to slow down the absorption of the carbohydrates
which means you will not get as strong peak

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.980
in the blood sugar as you would have with
the carbohydrates alone.\

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.489
\
Now that said, it still will affect your blood

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.149
sugar but just for you who hasn't started
out or have a 100% commitment, it's a step

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:57.130
in the right direction.\
\

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.809
\
NOW, let's look at those Top 10 foods that

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.770
does not affect the blood sugar. Bare in mind
that this list has no specific order and the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.500
first or last one doesn't mean they're the
best or healthiest.\

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.750
\
\

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.990
\
Ok, so number 1:\

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.700
Onion &amp; Garlic. Is very healthy and beneficial
and is actually the food that has less pesticides

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.909
and chemicals on them of the conventional
food (if you feel that organic is too expensive)

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.799
which makes it cheaper and easier to buy since
it's not that big difference between the organic

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.670
ones.\
\

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.670
So, garlic is really awesome for TONS of stuff.
It helps for example with:\

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.399
High cholesterol\
Poor digestion\

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.409
Diabetes and Blood sugar of course\
Yeast infections\

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.130
Boost immune system\
Increase absorption of iron and zinc\

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.189
Antioxidants\
Cold and flu\

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.430
It's anti-fungal\
Parasites\

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.899
Allergies and so on.\
\

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.739
Back in the ol' days, I'm talking like hundreds
and thousands of years, this was used a lot

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.120
by doctors since already then, they knew how
great garlic was.\

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.709
\
Onions are a very good source of vitamin C,

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.330
B6, biotin, chromium, calcium and dietary
fiber. In addition, they contain good amounts

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.330
of folic acid and vitamin B1 and K.\
It's also a great help for the liver.\

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:36.939
\
\

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.470
Number 2:\
Leafy greens.\

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.459
This is the most important part of my meals.
Leafy greens are so healthy, full of micronutrients

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.180
like vitamins and minerals, are very beneficial
for the body in so many ways and they are

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.900
alkaline which supports a tremendous amount
of health, especially in this world where

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.129
almost all "normal" food is so acid for our
bodies.\

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:06.129
This is just pure superfood with no effect
on the blood sugar.\

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.220
\
Number 3:\

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.319
Fatty seeds.\
Healthy seeds full of healthy fats like flaxseeds,

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.379
pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, chia seeds
and alfalfa seeds are super healthy and are

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:28.379
very high in fat and protein and have either
no carbs or low amount and almost exclusively

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.530
all of those carbs are dietary fiber and according
to my experiences with seeds and also according

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:40.530
to nutritiondata.self.com which is a huge
database with food and their nutrition, these

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:47.709
seeds have no Glycemic load which is a number
that measure how much it effects the blood

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.069
sugar.\
\

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.540
So next time you put cereal in your yogurt,
replace it with some great seeds or just eat

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.140
them as they are as snacks.\
\

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.099
Number 4:\
Avocados. This is truly my candy throughout

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:10.540
the day! It's delicious, can be used in many
ways and easy to prepare and eat, have as

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.330
a snack or whatever you want. Avocado is full
of healthy vitamins and minerals as well and

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.510
also have a great amount of the healthy fatty
acids Omega 3 and 6.\

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:28.510
It's also full of Vitamin A, C, E, K, B6,
Folate and it's also anti-inflammatory.\

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.710
\
Ok, so number 5:\

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.570
Coconut. If you eat the raw meat, cocoflakes
or the coconut oil, you will not have to worry

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.390
about your blood sugar since Coconut has a
high amount of fat and most of the carbs are

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:50.630
dietary fiber and it has basically no Glycemic
load at all. I always use coconut oil if I

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:57.630
cook something (which is very rarely) and
I also just eat it as it is or use it for

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.050
baking raw desserts of some sort.\
\

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:17.050
Number 6 is nuts.\
Nuts like walnuts, hazelnuts, peanuts or almonds

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.250
are super high in healthy fats and proteins
as well, barely any carb (which again is just

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:41.250
dietary fiber) and is very anti-inflammatory.
Short said: Nuts are healthy, great snacks

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.520
that doesn't mess with your blood sugar. Just
be little more careful with the cashew as

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.520
they tend to have more carbs but again, it's
nothing like a glass of juice or a snickers

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:01.520
bar but I've seen a little raise in my blood
sugar with cashew when I really go nuts and

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:12.320
eat like 100-200grams of it which makes sense
since the Glycemic load is 11 per 100gram

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:24.470
and over 15 it is classified as affecting
the blood sugar so it's close but the other

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:34.160
ones are no problem.\
\

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:48.560
Number 7:\
Herbs. Basil, cilantro, oregano, mint, lemon

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:56.070
balm and so on are very good because they
have basically no macronutrients, which is

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:01.800
the proteins, the fat and the carbs, but instead
a lot of vitamins and minerals so they have

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:08.800
no effect on the blood sugar but gives great
taste to food and have healthy vitamins and

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.480
minerals and a lot of cleansing and healing
properties. Make sure they are organic and

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:21.480
fresh or do as I do, plant your own!\
\

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.430
Number 8:\
Eggs. A great source of the very essential

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:03.310
vitamin B12 and good amount of protein and
fat. No effect on the blood sugar and a great

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:09.710
way to start the day and they're easy to cook
and cheap as well. What not to love? Just

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:15.050
be careful not to eat too much since eggs
are a dairy product which makes our body acids

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:20.910
so compensate with an avocado and some salad
to it, that's what I do for breakfast and

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:22.710
I love it!\
\

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:25.710
Number 9:\
Again, this is top 10 foods that doesn't affect

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:30.390
the blood sugar and even though you might
know I promote a very high alkaline diet,

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:34.960
for some people or in some times, you have
to use some dairy products and that's ok,

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:41.960
as long as it's not more than the alkaline
food and not too often. So here goes number

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:52.730
9 which is Butter and cheese. And I'm talking
real real butter without any additives, that

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:59.560
is high in fat and is just.. pure butter!
Cheese is harder to mess around with but even

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:04.490
though, the animals that the cheese is made
from can have been treated badly and been

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:10.220
fed growth hormones which of course affects
the outcome of the cheese products so make

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:17.220
sure it's organic here as well.\
\

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:24.360
So 
the last but not least, number 10 is:\
Oils.\

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:33.400
Oils are 100% fat and you got to be very delicate
and careful with what you choose. I only use

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:42.560
organic coconut oil, organic cold pressed
extra virgin olive oil or organic hemp oil.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:48.900
I always make sure that it's organic, high
quality and nothing bogus in it because using

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:55.900
normal conventional sunflower oil, or palm
oil and all those other mixes are just pure

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.290
crap and bottles of chemical shit storm, frankly
speaking.\

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:09.300
\
But the good ones are fantastic to have on

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:16.190
your food to spice up the flavor or to cook
if you have to and of course my favorite,

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:20.810
make your own pesto!\
\

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:27.810
So now, you've been going through the Top
10 Foods that doesn't affect the blood sugar

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:38.710
and you also saw what health benefits and
properties they have. So a quick recap:\

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:39.760
\
Number 1:\

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.010
Onions and garlic - great body cleansers in
so many ways\

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:43.520
\
Number 2:\

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.700
Leafy greens, these are just made for everything
and is truly superfood.\

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.490
\
Number 3:\

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:54.070
Seeds. Can be used in several ways, full of
great fats and vitamins &amp; minerals.\

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:54.860
\
Number 4:\

00:10:54.860 --> 00:11:00.080
Avocado. My personal favorite that is the
perfect snack or side dish to any meal\

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.640
\
Number 5:\

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:06.560
Coconut. Full of fat, delicious flavor and
comes in many ways and forms like oils, fat,

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.960
flakes, flour and so on.\
\

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.770
Number 6:\
Nuts. Great snack and replacement for candy

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.020
and great to have instead of cereal or granola
in your yogurt or milk.\

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:22.860
\
Number 7:\

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:27.780
Herbs. Mostly full of micronutrients instead
of protein, fats and carbs and of course spice

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:33.770
up the food and make it more alive and has
many ways to benefit the body and your overall

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:34.880
health.\
\

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.380
Number 8:\
Eggs. Perfect for breakfast, a lot of uses

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:43.129
in baking and cooking and a great source of
the essential Vitamin B12.\

00:11:43.129 --> 00:11:44.090
\
Number 9:\

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:48.830
Butter and cheese. Acid for the body so keep
it in moderation but as you know has many

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:55.190
uses in our lives and cheese is delicious
to frikkin' everything in my opinion. Full

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.860
of fat, no problems for the blood sugar.\
\

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:02.390
And number 10 which is oils that we also have
great use for in our kitchen.\

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:05.250
\
And as I always recommend, keep everything

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:10.779
you buy as local, as clean from chemicals
and as organic as possible and even consider

00:12:10.779 --> 00:12:15.410
growing your own in your garden, it's really
not that hard and I will make a video about

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:22.410
that in the future but until then, Google
can offer you 
a lot of help.\

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.590
