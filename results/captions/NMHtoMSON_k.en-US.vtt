00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.759
Sure, Madonna has had plenty of roles in her
life, but it’s her role as a mother that

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:15.419
she takes the most seriously. After all, with
six children it’s safe to say that she’s

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:20.779
got her hands full at all times. But at the
same time, she does her best to give everyone

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.620
the individual attention that they need while
also making sure that they are safe, sound,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.960
healthy and happy. What’s more, Madonna
knows the value of a good, quality education.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.940
She also has strict rules and guidelines that
her kids are expected to obey at all times.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.850
Learn more about the children of Madonna.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.960
Lourdes Leon.
Lourdes Leon was born to Madonna and her then

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.739
boyfriend Carlos Leon in 1996. When Madonna
announced that she was pregnant with a baby,

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.520
the world went into frenzy as she was arguably
‘the most famous woman in the whole world’

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.140
at that time in the mid 90s.
One year after her birth, Madonna broke up

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.690
with her boyfriend Carlos and started raising
her as a single mother.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.570
In late 1998, Madonna got her daughter’s
first pictures published in the Vanity Fair

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.440
magazine and the entire world became obsessed
by little Lourdes.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.440
Madonna knew the drawbacks of a celebrity
lifestyle and hence, she wanted her daughter

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.930
to stay away from the limelight and look for
a career in either law or accountancy. But

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.550
Lourdes’ interest lied in everything her
mother was famous for, especially acting and

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.830
fashion. As a kid, she accompanied Madonna
to several events which further brought her

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.080
into more limelight as she grew up.
Madonna started a relationship with ace English

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.680
film director Guy Ritchie and got married
to him in 2000. After marriage, she moved

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.010
to London with her daughter Lourdes and Lourdes
got a step-brother in form of Rocco. There,

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.290
Lourdes started attending a French school
along with her brother and became fluent in

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.090
the language.
She exhibited all the traces of being a very

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.030
intelligent kid ever since she was little.
Despite her image as an open-minded artist,

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.740
Madonna herself claimed that she was a very
strict mother. Lourdes was not allowed to

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.310
go out on her own before she turned 18 and
neither was she allowed to have any boyfriend.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.610
This strict parenthood resulted in Lourdes
growing up to be a well disciplined and hard

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.730
working young woman.
From time to time, rumours popped up that

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.810
her children were not very happy with her
strict disciplinary measures and hence they

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.840
preferred to be with their father more.
Lourdes showed traces of immense talent ever

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.540
since she was six years old. Her mother came
up with a popular English book series called

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.210
‘The English Roses’, which became highly
popular. Post the success of the series Madonna

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.850
claimed that her daughter had been her biggest
critic and provided some key creative elements

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.960
which were included in the book.
By the time she was 13 years old, Lourdes

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.500
had grown an impeccable fashion sense. As
told by Madonna herself, Lourdes was always

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.460
nitpicking on her mother’s dressing style
whenever she attended an event. Seeing her

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.130
interest in fashion and beauty, Madonna took
her help while she was designing clothes for

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:15.380
her brand called Material Girl. The line inspired
by 80’s chic fashion sense became highly

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.930
popular and it became very evident that Lourdes
was growing up to be a talented fashion designer.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.300
Around the same time, she got the offer to
star in a Harry Potter film but Madonna did

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.569
not let her appear on-screen before she finished
her high school at-least. As she entered her

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.220
teen years, she started singing as well. She
provided background vocals for her mother

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:44.060
during a concert in 2012 on the song ‘Superstar.’
Ironically, the single titled ‘Superstar’

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.630
was recorded by Madonna back in 1998 and was
dedicated to a young Lourdes. Apart from that,

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.970
Lourdes has appeared in two of the teaser
videos during the launch of Best of Madonna

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.020
collection ‘Celebration’ and contributed
her vocals to her mother’s ‘MDNA’ album.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.810
Despite being multi-talented, Lourdes wants
to forge a very serious career in acting and

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.170
has graduated from the La Guardia School of
Performing Arts back in 2014. Presently, she

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.900
is pursuing her majors in performing arts
from the University of Michigan, which Madonna

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.430
attended as well.
As a 19 years old teen, she made her modelling

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.200
debut with Stella McCartney ad campaign for
her perfume ‘Pop.’ It was the first perfume

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.600
Stella came out with in four years and Lourdes
joined hands with models Kenya Kinski-Jones,

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.389
Amandla Stenberg and Grimes for the campaign.
Lourdes Leon has been very vocal about her

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:43.680
relationships and one of her most talked about
relationships was with actor Timothee Chalamet,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.460
the ‘Homeland’ actor. She met him during
her time at the La Guardia High School. The

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.310
couple went public about their relationship
in 2013, but it did not last long. They broke

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.780
up a year later when Timothee was photographed
kissing another girl.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.661
Lourdes does not like to be in the spotlight
as much as her mother. For that reason, she

00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:08.680
refrains talking about her mother in front
of her friends who does not know her mother

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.840
is Madonna.
Due to her uncanny similarities to Madonna,

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.980
she is referred to as ‘mini-me’ by her
mother.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.400
In March 2018, Lourdes was spotted smoking
in a public place and making out with an unknown

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.350
young man. The rumours are ripe yet again
about her being in a relationship.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.699
Rocco Ritchie.
Rocco Ritchie was born in 2000, to Madonna

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.800
and Guy Ritchie.
Rocco Ritchie was just eight years old when

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.600
his celebrity parents Madonna and Guy Ritchie
decided to end their marriage. After their

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.850
separation, his mother and father settled
in New York and London respectively and young

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.290
Ritchie had to travel back and forth to spend
time with his parents. Ritchie traveled with

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:57.270
his mother during her concert tours around
the world. Later, he complained about not

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.460
getting to spend enough time with his mother
as she was always on the move, fulfilling

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.710
her professional commitments. Ritchie also
got tired of moving around all the time and

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:12.280
yearned for some stability. Madonna, however,
did not take her son’s feelings seriously

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.360
and retorted that she couldn’t be a “cool
mother to a grownup boy”. Things soon turned

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.540
ugly between the two and Ritchie moved to
London to live with his father and resumed

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.580
his studies there. Finally, Guy Ritchie won
Rocco’s custody as well.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.360
Things didn’t cool down for a while between
Madonna and her son as Ritchie was seen commenting

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.910
negatively on one of Madonna’s ice bucket
challenge photos on Instagram. The comment

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:42.440
was later deleted but not before it reached
the public. During this period of turmoil,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.690
Rocco Ritchie faced intense scrutiny from
the media and was stalked at every moment.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:53.600
He lost all the privacy he craved for in his
life and was regularly mentioned in the tabloids.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.010
He was even pictured sipping an alcoholic
beverage before reaching the legal age of

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.979
drinking. Once his neighbors complained about
him to the police and he was caught with cannabis

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:08.470
in his possession. He was rumored to be romantically
linked with each one of his female friends

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:14.180
and everything he did was scrutinized by the
media and commented upon. This deeply distressed

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.530
the young man.
Even though his relationships with his family

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:22.160
members were troubled, he eventually found
a kindred spirit in Brooklyn Beckham, the

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.990
son of former English footballer David Beckham
and former supermodel Victoria Beckham. With

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:33.310
Brooklyn’s support, Ritchie is planning
to move to New York to study art and film.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:37.490
Madonna is believed to be very happy with
the decision and is looking forward to spending

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:44.180
more time with her son and repair their relationship.
Rocco Ritchie has appeared in some TV shows,

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:49.610
including one episode of ‘The Ellen DeGeneres
Show’. He has also appeared in some documentaries

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.200
like ‘Madonna: Bitch I'm Madonna’, and
‘I'm Going to Tell You a Secret’.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.580
Rocco once dated Kim Turnbull. Currently,
he is said to be in a relationship with singer

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.820
Chantelle Lee.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:06.699
David Banda.
David was born in 2005, in the southeastern

00:08:06.699 --> 00:08:13.310
African country, Malawi. His biological father,
Yohane, abandoned the newborn in the nursing

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:18.940
home after his mother died. Later, the baby
was handed over to the 'Home of Hope' orphanage

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:24.590
located in the district of 'Mchinji.'
A month later, when Madonna visited the orphanage

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:30.259
while touring for one of her charity programs,
she saw David for the first time. He was not

00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:34.740
in a good health. Suffering from pneumonia
then, the little David was on the verge of

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:41.449
death. Madonna immediately filed for an adoption
and wanted the baby as soon as possible. After

00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:47.190
the initial official legalities were over,
the baby was finally handed over to Madonna.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:52.819
She named the baby David Banda Mwale Ciccone
Ritchie, which included the names of his birthplace

00:08:52.819 --> 00:08:58.629
and Madonna’s then-husband, Guy Ritchie.
Even after Madonna got the permission to adopt

00:08:58.629 --> 00:09:03.689
David, she had to sweat really hard to get
the possession of the baby. At the time of

00:09:03.689 --> 00:09:08.899
David’s adoption, Maddona’s divorce was
already filed. She was battling for the custody

00:09:08.899 --> 00:09:14.800
of her biological son with Guy Ritchie. Out
of nowhere, Yohane came into the picture and

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.240
said that he would withdraw the custody as
Madonna's controversial lifestyle might affect

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:26.160
David's future. He wanted the celebrity singer
to first resolve her other legal issues. Madonna

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:31.129
again had to go through all the procedures
for adoption. The legalities ran for a little

00:09:31.129 --> 00:09:36.429
longer. Madonna later visited Malawi, along
with David, to have a final settlement with

00:09:36.429 --> 00:09:42.249
Yohane. That was David’s first visit to
his birthplace after his adoption.

00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:47.490
David was passionate about football from the
very beginning. He started his training early.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:52.470
He later moved to Lisbon to continue with
his training under the 'Benfica Academy.'

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:59.089
In 2018, Madonna visited one of the 'Benfica
Youth' team’s matches to cheer for her son.

00:09:59.089 --> 00:10:04.129
David displayed some incredible skills on
the ground. The Portuguese club, ‘Benfica,’

00:10:04.129 --> 00:10:10.209
won the league and David was even awarded
as the best performer in the 'Under-12' category.

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:15.439
Madonna and David have made a couple of public
appearances together. The mother-son duo attended

00:10:15.439 --> 00:10:20.660
the 'Rebel Heart Tour' in 2015 where they
were seen singing ‘Like a Prayer.’ They

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:25.639
also walked on the red carpet of the '2014
Grammy Awards' while donning matching black

00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:31.619
business suits. Madonna, who is highly active
on social media, keeps posting pictures and

00:10:31.619 --> 00:10:37.889
videos featuring David. She once posted a
video footage showing him singing and dancing.

00:10:37.889 --> 00:10:43.149
When Madonna adopted David, she was still
married to Guy Ritchie. This officially makes

00:10:43.149 --> 00:10:45.860
him David’s father.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:51.319
Mercy James.
Mercy James was born in 2006 in Malawi. She

00:10:51.319 --> 00:10:57.800
was born to her Malawian parents James Kambewa
and Mwandida Kambewa. Her mother Mwandida

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.459
Kambewa passed away eight days after James'
birth.

00:11:01.459 --> 00:11:03.930
Madonna talked about Mercy in an interview
saying:

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:09.689
“I met Mercy soon after I met my son David...
Mercy was suffering from malaria, and David

00:11:09.689 --> 00:11:14.140
from pneumonia. And when I held each of them
in my arms, I Whispered in their ears, that

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.850
I would look after them.”
Madonna had to face a lot of troubles while

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:23.769
adopting James. She discussed it in her speech,
“This time, the judge who was oresiding

00:11:23.769 --> 00:11:28.730
said no. I was recently divorced, and she
informed me, as a divorced woman, I was not

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:34.059
fit to raise children and that Mercy James
was better of growing up in an orphanage.”

00:11:34.059 --> 00:11:39.179
Madonna fought for over three years to win
the right to adopt Mercy James. Madonna took

00:11:39.179 --> 00:11:45.110
James to her home to start a new life together.
James' original family was heartbroken and

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:49.949
struggled to give their child away.
James' original family has claimed they have

00:11:49.949 --> 00:11:56.019
no contact with the child since her adoption.
Madonna, however, said Mercy James has never

00:11:56.019 --> 00:12:01.399
been kept away from her culture and heritage.
She is taken to Malawi every year to visit

00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:04.569
her family, friends and to learn about her
roots.

00:12:04.569 --> 00:12:09.589
However, Mercy's parents along with her mother's
best friend are collecting evidence and witnesses

00:12:09.589 --> 00:12:14.689
to go against the adoption and bringing James
back to her original place.

00:12:14.689 --> 00:12:19.310
Mercy James is studying to build her future
career. She might have a net worth around

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:26.739
$1 million at present, as her mother Madonna
currently shares the net worth of $590 million.

00:12:26.739 --> 00:12:32.100
Mercy James is currently twelve years old
and is too young to get involved in relationships.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:37.569
Currently, she is studying and enjoying her
time with Madonna along with her siblings.

00:12:37.569 --> 00:12:42.189
The family is seen spending a vacation to
different destinations, as Madonna shares

00:12:42.189 --> 00:12:47.629
their moments on social networking sites.
In addition, Madonna has opened the country's

00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:53.029
first ever pediatric surgery and intensive
care center, The Mercy James Institution for

00:12:53.029 --> 00:12:56.559
Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care.

00:12:56.559 --> 00:13:02.939
Twins Stella and Esther.
Twins Stella and Esther were born in 2012.

00:13:02.939 --> 00:13:07.769
Madonna adopted their from Malawi in 2017
after meeting them in an orphanage two years

00:13:07.769 --> 00:13:11.820
earlier.
The pop queen began the adoption process more

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:16.089
two years ago after being 'compelled' to help
the twins when she saw them at the Home of

00:13:16.089 --> 00:13:19.730
Hope orphanage where they had been left by
their grandmother.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:24.819
The actual application was granted in a fortnight,
whereas critics say it normally takes around

00:13:24.819 --> 00:13:29.010
three months.
Speaking about the adoption process, Madonna

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:33.130
admitted the children are unaware of their
mother's international status after being

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:39.110
whisked away from a life of poverty in Malawi.
'They don't have a clue and it's a good thing.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:44.009
I'm just their mother,' she explained.
The twins' mother died five days after giving

00:13:44.009 --> 00:13:49.170
birth due to complications from a caesarean
section operation in August 2012.

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:54.540
An initial report by social workers found
their father Adam Mwale had abandoned the

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.820
