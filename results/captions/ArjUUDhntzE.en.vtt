We're proud to present the Apple Skin Twist!

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.280
It twists your skin, okay

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.320
Now if you just leave it on there you can surprise yourself

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.460
cause it can make up to 50 percent more flaps

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.460
yeah look at that

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.900
pretty neat huh?

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.640
now you're gonna love the Apple Lickamaforbus

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.620
and yes I know that it sounds like a sex robot -- that's not appropriate

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.660
no the Lickamaforbus is really a plant based guitar

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.000
and as you see, it has walnut spores

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.800
great, right?

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.940
yeah, they're really just a fancy touch so we can trend-set

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.620
but there's more to... uh oh.... dang it

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.920
I gotta pee!

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.500
We're happy to finally announce the Apple Handsome Anthony

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.440
Yep

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.880
Now Anthony can take you to a museum or to the Snowcone Palace

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.240
but if he ever asks for Geppetto, then you need to destroy him forcefully first thing

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.760
it's vital okay

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.600
Apple Wings are Apple's hot wings, and they're meaty and they're juicy

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.840
and the names are like "Mystery Colon" and "Soul Snatcher" and "Aye Aye Kevin"

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.840
mmm hmmm

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.780
they're gonna be
great... now we also have socks

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.880
let me explain

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.980
So let's talk about the Apple Hole

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.020
Now this is indeed a mini black hole so it
could have many uses

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.200
For instance,  you could time switch four mini checkers into one weredonkey

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.020
yep, okay?

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.160
now this is our fanciest tetra-fusion hole at this point

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.000
The only thing is it's not portable yet

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.860
Let's talk about the Apple Garfenafuten Tuten-Juten Exiobalexis

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.660
Or as we like to call it, "Garf Exi"

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.500
So I intended to show you what it sorta does, but it's really stumped a few of us

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.240
So instead, I get to announce something else

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.220
I give you the Apple Wish Prince

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.780
[crowd cheers]

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.220
Hello, Wish Prince.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.340
Do you have a wiiiiiish?

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.520
I wish that my Wish Prince would just give me seven diamonds

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.180
GRANTED!

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.920
and there it is... it's done

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.400
So what you see before you --

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.360
Do you have a wiiiiiiish??

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.880
No, but thanks Wish Prince, so anyway

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.660
Do you have a wiiiiiiish??

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.260
Uhhh, yeah I wish you'd quit doing this

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.220
Do you have a wiiiiiiish??

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.940
yeah I don't know what's happened, 'cause
he's supposed to quit asking, so it's like -

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.120
Do you have a wiiiiiiish??

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.160
Tyler, can you help me? Can't you guys move it forward to the next section?

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.340
You can't?

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.500
Dude, you're a tech guy -- is it
really hard?

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.820
you suck

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.000
Do you have a wiiiiiiish??

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.200
introducing the Apple DeBonk DeBonk, a musical can opener that-

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.180
The truth is when I was 8, I was 12

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.480
and then

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.180
I started work at the backgammon store, and as the new guy, got in a fight --

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.600
Apple Toast is a magnificent
cinnamon toast, and that's important today --

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.100
...and that's when I knew that the judge could sense that I'm Roman

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.360
... eyes on the soon-to-be legendary Apple Windmill!

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.600
...the woman's name was Linda Foop

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.040
a loud Irish woman with hard tooth enamel...

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.060
...I'm really excited to introduce the Apple Steven Forkhead!

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.940
As you probably guessed, you
stick forks in it and then you hear a doorbell

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.820
Check it out!

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.020
Hey is this boring? 'Cause wow, I mean

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.920
'cause what I'm seeing on your faces says it is

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.940
'kay
