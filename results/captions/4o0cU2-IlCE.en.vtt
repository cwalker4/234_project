WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW."

I'M STEPHEN COLBERT.

THANK YOU.

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:07.640 size:78% position:39%
I'M EXCITED, TOO.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.844

YEAH.

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.381 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT'S SPECIAL.

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:18.518 align:start size:88% position:13%
SPECIAL NIGHT.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:19.619
I GOT YOU THIS MONOLOGUE.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.588 align:start size:88% position:13%
AND THE SENATE GAVE US ALL
SOMETHING YESTERDAY.

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:25.625
REMEMBER THE INFAMOUS TRUMP
TOWER MEETING BETWEEN KREMLIN

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:31.664
LAWYER NATALIA VESELNITSKAYA?

♪
( LAUGHTER )

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:43.309
SHE MET WITH DONALD TRUMP, JR.,
JARED KUSHNER, AND PAUL

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:44.377
MANAFORT-- OR AS I CALL THEM,
THE THREE COLL-OOGES.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:45.245 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
WELL, YESTERDAY, THE SENATE

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.714 size:88% position:56%
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE RELEASED
2,500 HUNDRED PAGES ON THAT

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:48.581 size:88% position:44%
TRUMP TOWER MEETING.

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:53.053 align:start size:88% position:13%
2,500 PAGES?

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:55.822
MAN, IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG
TIME FOR DONALD TRUMP JR. TO

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:57.857 size:75% position:38%
TWEET THOSE OUT!

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.893
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, THE DOCUMENTED PURPOSE OF

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.629
THIS MEETING WAS TO GET DIRT ON
HILLARY CLINTON FROM THE RUSSIAN

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.831
GOVERNMENT, BUT BOTH DON JUNIOR
AND THE PRESIDENT HAVE INSISTED

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:08.501
TRUMP SENIOR KNEW NOTHING ABOUT
IT.

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:10.837
IN FACT, DON JUNIOR TOLD
SENATORS, "I WOULDN'T HAVE

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:13.440
WASTED HIS TIME WITH IT."

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.144 align:end position:100%
BECAUSE DAD GETS ANGRY WHEN YOU
INTERRUPT HIS TOILET BURGER.

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:26.286
( LAUGHTER )
BUT THE TRANSCRIPT SHOWS THAT

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:29.856 align:end position:100%
AFTER DON JUNIOR SET UP THIS
MEETING WITH HELP FROM A RUSSIAN

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:34.060
OLIGARCH'S SON, AS YOU DO WHEN
YOU'RE NOT COLLUDING, HE

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.963
IMMEDIATELY MADE "A FOUR-MINUTE
MYSTERY CALL TO A BLOCKED

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:38.865 align:start size:88% position:13%
NUMBER."

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:41.668
AND EARLIER TESTIMONY REVEALED
THAT "CANDIDATE TRUMP'S PRIMARY

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:43.536
RESIDENCE HAS A BLOCKED NUMBER."

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:45.371
ALTHOUGH, IT COMES UP ON DON
JUNIOR'S PHONE AS "DEFINITELY

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:48.074 align:start size:88% position:13%
NOT DAD."

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:50.944
( LAUGHTER )
THEN, RIGHT AFTER THE CALL TO

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:55.515
THE BLOCKED NUMBER, DON JUNIOR,
CALLED THE OLIGARCH'S SON BACK.

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:58.051
NOW, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE
SMOKING GUN, BUT IF YOU STILL

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:03.556
BELIEVE DON JUNIOR, I WANT SOME
OF WHAT YOU'RE SMOKING.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:05.291 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
BECAUSE DON JUNIOR CLAIMS HE

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:10.430
DOESN'T REMEMBER WHO HE SPOKE
WITH IN THAT CALL.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.032
SURE, HE COULD'VE BEEN SPEAKING
TO ANYBODY BETWEEN TWO CALLS TO

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:15.401 align:start size:88% position:13%
A RUSSIAN OLIGARCH'S SON
PLANNING TO COLLUDE WITH THE

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:18.505 size:84% position:42%
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT.

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:20.039
"HELLO, DOMINO'S, YOU'LL NEVER
GUESS WHO HAS DIRT ON HILLARY

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.442 align:start size:88% position:13%
CLINTON!

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:24.711
OKAY, GOT TO GO, I NEED TO CALL
THE KREMLIN BACK.

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:25.345 align:start size:88% position:13%
CLICK.

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:26.479 align:start size:88% position:13%
DAMN IT.

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:30.483
I FORGOT TO ORDER GARLIC KNOTS."

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:35.855 align:start size:88% position:13%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I ALWAYS FORGET THE GARLIC

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:36.055 align:start size:88% position:13%
KNOTS.

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:37.223
AND THAT WASN'T THE ONLY THING
TRUMP JUNIOR DIDN'T REMEMBER

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:38.291 align:start size:88% position:13%
DOING.

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:40.793 size:88% position:56%
WE COUNTED, AND TRUMP JUNIOR
TOLD THE SENATE JUDICIARY HE

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:45.431
COULDN'T RECALL SOMETHING, 186
TIMES.

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:48.501 align:start size:88% position:13%
OR, AS DON JUNIOR SAID,
"WHATEVER NUMBER COMES AFTER

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:52.372
185-- I DO NOT RECALL."

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:54.674
( LAUGHTER )
OF COURSE, SOME PEOPLE AREN'T SO

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:56.910
FORGIVING ABOUT MEMORY LAPSES
DURING TESTIMONY.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.345
LIKE DONALD TRUMP JUNIOR, WHO
ONCE TWEETED, "IF YOU TELL THE

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:02.182
TRUTH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
REMEMBER ANYTHING. --MARK

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.317 align:start size:88% position:13%
TWAIN."

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:06.252
TO WHICH MARK TWAIN RESPONDED,
"YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL. --MARK

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:08.855 align:start size:88% position:13%
TWAIN."

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:11.291 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( PIANO RIFF )

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.960 align:start size:88% position:13%
( APPLAUSE )
YEAH.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.130 size:88% position:56%
JUST CLEANED IT UP A LITTLE.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.033 align:start size:88% position:13%
I THINK.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.768
AND WE ALSO LEARNED FROM THE
SENATE THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:24.804
TRUMP TOWER MEETING THAT WE
NEVER HEARD ABOUT BEFORE.

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:28.508
THIS ONE WAS AFTER THE ELECTION,
BETWEEN TRUMP OFFICIALS AND

00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:31.678
RUSSIA'S AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.,
SERGEY KISLYAK, WHO IN THE

00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:33.880
RUSSIAN TRADITION, APPEARS
TO HAVE MANY SMALLER PEOPLE

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.050 align:start size:88% position:13%
INSIDE OF HIM.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:49.095 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
YEAH.

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:49.395 align:start size:88% position:13%
MATRUSKADAL.

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:50.597 align:end position:100%
DON JUNIOR TESTIFIED THAT HE
WASN'T TOLD ABOUT THIS MEETING,

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:52.765 align:end position:100%
AND WHEN ASKED WHY HE DIDN'T
JOIN IT, HE REPLIED, "BECAUSE I

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:55.868
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS ABOUT
AND I WAS SWEATY FROM THE GYM."

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:57.637 align:start size:88% position:13%
FINALLY!

00:03:57.637 --> 00:04:00.506
SOMETHING I CAN BELIEVE.

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:03.476
DON JUNIOR BEING IGNORANT AND
SWEATY.

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:05.645
( LAUGHTER )
OF COURSE, THE WHOLE COLLUSION

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:08.114
THING IS ABOUT THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN COLLABORATING WITH THE

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:11.117
RUSSIANS WHO HACKED HILLARY'S
EMAILS AND LEAKED THEM THROUGH

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:14.120 align:start size:88% position:13%
WIKILEAKS.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.689
BUT DON JUNIOR WAS VERY CLEAR
THAT HE WAS NOT IN CONTACT WITH

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:25.131
WIKILEAKS-- MUCH, WELL, MAYBE A
BIT, TELLING THE SENATE, "I

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:27.367
THINK THE ONLY TIME I RESPONDED
TO THEM WAS, HEY, WHEN AM I

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:32.071
GOING TO RECEIVE THE NEXT LEAK?"
( LAUGHTER )

00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:33.072 align:start size:88% position:13%
"OH, THAT'S EXACTLY THE
COLLUDING PART?

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:35.475
CAN I CHANGE MY ANSWER TO NO?

00:04:35.475 --> 00:04:37.410
MAY I PHONE A FRIEND?

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.346
AND QUICK FOLLOW UP: MAY I HAVE
A FRIEND?"

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:44.784
( LAUGHTER )
SO HE MET WITH MEMBERS OF THE

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:49.389
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT TO GET DIRT
ON HILLARY, HE KNEW WHEN THE

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.091
HACKED EMAILS WERE COMING OUT
AND HE WAS COORDINATING THE

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:55.028 align:start size:88% position:13%
TIMING OF THEIR RELEASE WITH
WIKILEAKS.

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:56.562
IS THAT THE SMOKING GUN?

00:04:56.562 --> 00:04:57.563 size:84% position:42%
IS THE GUN SMOKING?

00:04:57.563 --> 00:05:01.801
CAN WE CHECK THE GUN?

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:02.535
&gt;&gt; AH, HE'S SO GUILTY.

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:10.176 align:start size:88% position:13%
HE'S SO GUILTY!"
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: NOPE, JUST FIRE.

00:05:10.176 --> 00:05:14.147
AND WHILE HIS LAWYER LOOKED ON
IN HORROR, DON JUNIOR CONTINUED,

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:17.550
"AND THEY WOULD REACH OUT ON A
FEW OCCASIONS, SORT OF PASSING

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.687
ALONG NEWS, HEY, YOU MAY WANT TO
TWEET THIS. "

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:23.222
AND THEN YOU WOULD JUST TWEET
IT?

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:26.125
IN THAT CASE, "HEY, DON JUNIOR,
YOU MAY WANT TO TWEET THIS:

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:33.566
WE DID IT, PLEASE ARREST MY DAD!

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:38.304 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( PIANO RIFF )

00:05:38.304 --> 00:05:40.807
BUT IT WASN'T JUST DON JUNIOR.

00:05:40.807 --> 00:05:43.076
THE COMMITTEE ALSO TALKED TO THE
AGENT WHO REPRESENTED THE

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:46.412 align:start size:88% position:13%
RUSSIANS, MUSIC PRODUCER AND
WORST CASE SCENARIO SIMON

00:05:46.412 --> 00:05:55.188

( LAUGHTER )
SIMON COWELL FANS HERE TONIGHT.

00:05:58.591 --> 00:06:00.193
( LAUGHTER )
HE TOLD THE COMMITTEE THAT THE

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.594 align:end position:100%
OLIGARCH'S SON INSISTED HE HELP
SET UP A MEETING WITH DONALD

00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:06.065
TRUMP, JR. TO PASS ALONG DIRT ON
HILLARY CLINTON, OVERRIDING

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:10.470
GOLDSTONE'S OWN WARNINGS THAT
THE MEETING WOULD BE A BAD IDEA.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.272
AND IF HE THOUGHT IT WAS A BAD
IDEA, YOU KNOW IT WAS A BAD

00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:15.708

THINGS HE THOUGHT WERE GOOD

THE BRITISH ARE, ON BEHALF OF

00:06:47.373 --> 00:06:51.277

( LAUGHTER )
NOW, PRIOR TO THESE TRANSCRIPTS

00:07:00.686 --> 00:07:01.988
COMING OUT, THE TRUMP TEAM HAD
PLANNED TO USE THIS ANNIVERSARY

00:07:01.988 --> 00:07:04.190
AS A TURNING POINT IN THEIR
CAMPAIGN TO END MUELLER'S PROBE.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:04.957

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; THEY CAN'T INDICT HIM,
CONSTITUTIONALLY.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.608 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; WHICH MUELLER AGREED TO
TODAY.

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:30.176 align:start size:88% position:13%
HE'S GOING TO ABIDE BY NO
INDICTMENT OF THE PRESIDENT.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:31.777
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: NOTICE HOW NEITHER
OF THEM SAID TRUMP'S INNOCENT.

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:33.946
IT'S LIKE THE OLD SAYING, "IF
YOU CAN'T DO THE TIME, BECOME

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:36.582
PRESIDENT AND THEN CRIME, CRIME,
CRIME."

00:08:36.582 --> 00:08:38.718
( LAUGHTER )
BUT GIULIANI'S DOES HAVE A POINT

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:42.989
BECAUSE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
HELD THEY CAN'T INDICT A SITTING

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:46.359
PRESIDENT "SINCE THE NIXON
ADMINISTRATION," AND THAT WAS

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:48.528 align:start size:88% position:13%
"REAFFIRMED IN THE CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION."

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:52.798 align:start size:88% position:13%
YES, OUR TWO MOST INNOCENT
PRESIDENTS.

00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:54.634
( LAUGHTER )
"I AM NOT A CROOK" AND, "I DID

00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:59.672
NOT HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH
THAT WOMAN," IS NOW, "I AM A

00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:05.144
CROOK, AND I DID HAVE SEXUAL
RELATIONS WITH THAT WOMAN, AND

00:09:05.144 --> 00:09:11.183 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU CAN SUCK IT!"
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:09:11.183 --> 00:09:12.985 size:88% position:56%
I'M PARAPHRASING, OBVIOUSLY.

00:09:12.985 --> 00:09:13.886
DO WE HAVE THAT ON TAPE?

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:17.657 size:75% position:38%
IS THAT A QUOTE?

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:19.058 align:start size:88% position:13%
AND GIULIANI BRUSHED OFF DON
JUNIOR'S MEETING WITH THE

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:20.493
RUSSIANS TO GET DIRT ON HILLARY:
&gt;&gt; THERE IS NOTHING ILLEGAL

00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:22.361 align:start size:88% position:13%
ABOUT THAT.

00:09:22.361 --> 00:09:26.265
EVEN IF IT COMES FROM A RUSSIAN
OR A GERMAN OR AN AMERICAN, IT

00:09:26.265 --> 00:09:28.301 align:start size:88% position:13%
DOESN'T MATTER.

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:29.769
THEY NEVER USED IT IS THE MAIN
THING.

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:30.536 size:84% position:42%
THEY NEVER USED IT.

00:09:30.536 --> 00:09:32.004 size:78% position:39%
THEY REJECTED IT.

00:09:32.004 --> 00:09:33.673
IF THERE WAS COLLUSION WITH THE
RUSSIANS, THEY WOULD HAVE USED

00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:35.274 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT.

00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:37.043
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: WHAT THE WHA?

00:09:37.043 --> 00:09:40.112 size:78% position:39%
DON'T ADMIT THAT.

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:44.684 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU'RE THE DUMBEST LAWYER ON
EARTH.

00:09:44.684 --> 00:09:45.585
( LAUGHTER )
"YOUR HONOR, MY CLIENT IS NOT

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:48.454 align:start size:88% position:13%
THE MURDERER BECAUSE NO ONE
WOULD GIVE HIM A GUN.

00:09:48.454 --> 00:09:49.355
IF HE HAD ONE, WE'D ALL BE DEAD.

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:52.792 size:88% position:44%
THE GUY'S A MANIAC."

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:57.229 align:start size:88% position:13%
LOOK OUT!

00:09:57.229 --> 00:09:58.097 align:start size:88% position:13%
THERE HE GOES!

00:09:58.097 --> 00:10:04.904 align:start size:88% position:13%
GET HIM!

00:10:04.904 --> 00:10:08.407 align:start size:88% position:13%
( APPLAUSE )
IS HE GONE?

00:10:08.407 --> 00:10:17.917
( PIANO RIFF )
MEANWHILE, BACK ON THE FARM, THE

00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:18.818
PRESIDENT
CELEBRATED THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY

00:10:18.818 --> 00:10:21.587 align:start size:88% position:13%
OF MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION
WITH THIS TWEET --

00:10:21.587 --> 00:10:23.956
"CONGRATULATIONS AMERICA, WE ARE
NOW INTO THE SECOND YEAR OF THE

00:10:23.956 --> 00:10:29.462
GREATEST WITCH HUNT IN AMERICAN
HISTORY."

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:31.564 align:end position:100%
FIRST, YOU DO REALIZE THAT THOSE
ACTUAL WITCH HUNTS WERE ALSO

00:10:31.564 --> 00:10:35.901
AMERICAN HISTORY, RIGHT?

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:37.503
( LAUGHTER )
AND SECOND, YOU DON'T NEED TO

00:10:37.503 --> 00:10:38.504 size:75% position:38%
CONGRATULATE US.

00:10:38.504 --> 00:10:40.606
WE'RE NOT VLADIMIR PUTIN.

00:10:40.606 --> 00:10:43.109
AND THIRD, CAN WE STOP CALLING
IT A WITCH HUNT?

00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:46.012
THAT IMPLIES EVERYONE INVOLVED
IS INNOCENT AND MUELLER'S

00:10:46.012 --> 00:10:49.181 size:88% position:56%
ALREADY CHARGED 19 PEOPLE AS
WELL AS THREE COMPANIES, AND

00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:51.884
SECURED FIVE GUILTY PLEAS.

00:10:51.884 --> 00:10:54.353
FOR PETE'S SAKE, THEY ARRESTED
MICHAEL FLYNN AT THE TARMAC

00:10:54.353 --> 00:11:00.393 size:88% position:56%
J.F.K., WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO
TAKE OFF ON HIS BROOMSTICK.

00:11:00.393 --> 00:11:06.032 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:12.304
( PIANO RIFF )
AND TRUMP TWOTE ON, "THE ONLY

00:11:12.304 --> 00:11:16.709 align:start size:88% position:13%
COLLUSION WAS THAT DONE BY
DEMOCRATS."

00:11:16.709 --> 00:11:17.209 size:81% position:41%
"I DIDN'T COLLUDE.

00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:19.345 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU COLLUDED.

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:23.716
I'M RUBBER, YOU'RE GLUE.

00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:26.652 align:end position:100%
AND AS STORMY DANIELS WOULD TELL
YOU, I DON'T USE A RUBBER ."

00:11:26.652 --> 00:11:27.987 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:29.355
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
