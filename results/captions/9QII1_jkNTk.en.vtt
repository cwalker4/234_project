00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.820
The President:  Thank you very
much for being here.

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:03.590
We have a very big moment

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.750
because we have Danny Burch
back home,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.020
where he should be.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.910
He was in Yemen,
in a very horrible situation —

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.910
a captive, a prisoner.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.320
You can call him whatever you
want, but it wasn’t good.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.310
He was there for 18 months —

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.550
even a little more
than 18 months —

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.080
and we got him out.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.640
And we had some great help
from UAE and all of our friends.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.769
But we got Danny out.
And he’s just come home,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.930
said hello to his family,
his beautiful son.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.170
Thank you for being here.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.910
And it’s nice to see your
father back where he belongs.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.070
I want to thank our Vice
President for being here.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.820
I want to thank Mitt Romney —
Senator Romney,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.530
Senator Graham
for being here.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.010
They were in the office,
unrelated to this,

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.140
and they heard about this and
they know the story of Danny.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.000
This is a very big story in our
country, what they did with you.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.430
But we got him out,
and we’re very happy about it.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.780
And, Danny, welcome home.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.300
Mr. Burch:  Thank you so much.
It’s great to be here.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.540
The President:  Thank you
very much.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.750
Thank you very much.
Mr. Burch:  (Inaudible.)

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.110
The President:  Thank you
, Danny.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.410
(Applause.)
Would you like to say something?

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.900
Mr. Burch:  Gosh, it’s great
to be an American.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.650
(Applause.)

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.820
The President:  
Thank you, Danny. Appreciate it.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.880
Thank you all very much.
Mike — Mike,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.640
do you have anything to say
while we’re here?

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.810
The Vice President:  Just,
I’m so proud of this team —

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.040
the State Department team.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.620
Mr. President, you’ve made it
clear to the wider world

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.460
that when Americans are detained
anywhere in the world,

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.320
we want them home.
And we work urgently to do that.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.200
And we’ve seen great successes
over the last two years.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.430
And Danny’s homecoming
is just one more statement

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.680
about the priority that you
and our administration,

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.610
our entire team,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.500
place on bringing Americans
back from captivity.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.920
So it’s an honor
to be here with you.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.530
And, Danny, it’s an honor
to say, “Welcome home.”

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.030
Mr. Burch:  Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.250
The President:  Well,
I will say, Danny,

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.250
we’re 20 and 0.
We’ve gotten a lot of them out.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.720
And they shouldn’t
have been there —

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.050
Aya from Egypt, and many others.
North Korea.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.350
We have a few negotiations
going on right now.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.620
I won’t tell you
where because we don’t want

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.310
to blow
the negotiation out the window,

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.030
but we have
a few negotiations going.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.730
I love doing it because
I love the end result.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.550
This is the end result:
a happy man with a happy family.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.910
Lindsey, would you have
anything to say?

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.110
Senator Graham:  
Congratulations.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.770
You’ve got a very good
hostage negotiator.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.590
And to the Yemen people,

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.000
I’m sorry you’re having
to go through

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.240
what you’re going through.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.190
And thank you
for taking Iran on.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.650
I appreciate that,
Mr. President.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.240
The root of most evil
in the Mideast is Iran.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.530
Thank you.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.880
The President:  Well, would you
say maybe a few words?

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.160
You worked very hard.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.360
Mr. O’Brien:  Sure,
Mr. President.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.270
Thank you.
And this wouldn’t happen

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.950
with all of these hostages
and detainees

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.480
without the support
of the President.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.950
The President has had
unparalleled success

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.650
in bringing Americans home
without paying concessions,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.930
without prisoner exchanges,
but through force of will

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.120
and the goodwill that
he’s generated around the world.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.300
So thank you to the UAE,

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.320
which assisted President Trump
in this important rescue.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.680
And, again, I’m honored
to be here with you today, sir.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.990
The President:  Thank you.
That’s so nice.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.690
Mr. O’Brien:  And welcome home,
Danny.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.630
Mr. Burch:  Thank you, sir.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.830
The President:  The
Ambassador said

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.170
that he’s the greatest hostage
negotiator in our history.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.700
And I say, “Don’t say it because
they’ll never write it.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.920
They’ll never write it.”

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.320
Mitt, would you say something?
Please.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.530
Senator Romney:  I’d be
happy to.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.290
I congratulate
the administration,

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.600
the President,
the Vice President,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.410
for making this
such a high priority.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.660
Welcome home.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.490
It’s wonderful to have you back
in our wonderful land.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.590
Thank you also to Robert O’Brien
and the entire team at State

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.300
and the administration
that’s working to find ways

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.500
to bring our hostages home.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.720
It’s a great and important work,
and we very much appreciate it.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.230
It’s wonderful to have one of
our own come back to our shores.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.210
The President:  Thank you
very much, Mitt.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.800
And, Robert, again,
congratulations to everybody.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.790
Keep it going. We have some
other ones going right now

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.770
that nobody knows about,
but we’re going to pull it off.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.960
And I really —
you’re doing a fantastic job.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.210
Thank you very much.
Mr. O’Brien:  Thank you, sir.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.450
The President:  Thank
all very much.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.940
Thank you. Thank you.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.240
The Press:  How are the trade
talks going with China?

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.790
The President:  Going okay.
We’re moving along.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.990
We’re discussing that
with Lindsey and Mitt.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.380
They’re moving along well,
and we’ll see what happens.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.400
They’re either going
to be a good deal

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.710
or it’s not going to be a deal.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.840
But I think they’re
moving on very nicely.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.820
The Press:  Mr. President, is
North Korea breaking a promise

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.770
by rebuilding
a key missile launch site?

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.130
The President:  Well,
we’re going to see.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.120
It’s too early to see.
But we have to solve a problem.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.510
We have a very
nasty problem there.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.140
We have to solve a problem.
The relationship is good.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.739
I would be very disappointed
if that were happening.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.290
It’s a very early report, and
we’re the ones that put it out.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.970
But I would be very, very
disappointed in Chairman Kim.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.110
And I don’t think I will be,
but we’ll see what happens.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.480
We’ll take a look.
It’ll ultimately get solved.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.460
Thank you all very much.
I appreciate it.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.670
The Press:  What’s your message
to Republicans who choose

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:00.880
to vote against your
national emergency declaration?

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.700
What’s your message
to Republicans

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.570
who have already chosen
to vote against it?

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.153
The President:  We’ll have to
see how the vote goes.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.620
We’ll see how the vote goes.
