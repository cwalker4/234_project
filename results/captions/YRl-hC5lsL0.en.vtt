00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.470
I saw you're doing
a movie with Goldie Hawn.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.599
&gt;&gt; Yes!
&gt;&gt; And she plays your mom, is that right?

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:10.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, she's my younger sister.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.018
No, yes, she plays my mom.

00:00:12.018 --> 00:00:14.580
I have been the biggest
Goldie fan forever.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.620
&gt;&gt; She's fantastic.
&gt;&gt; I mean in your book and her book,

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.070
yeah, she's been such a huge idol for
me forever.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.271
And so I just begged her,
we fought to do this movie together and

00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:27.713
we had the best time.

00:00:27.713 --> 00:00:30.666
I got to hang with Kate Hudson,
right guys?

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:33.472
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Kate Hudson, very nice.

00:00:33.472 --> 00:00:38.197
Fun, so fun and they were do you wanna go
swim with the dolphins and I was okay,

00:00:38.197 --> 00:00:41.745
again trash,
we didn't grow up doing things like that.

00:00:41.745 --> 00:00:45.100
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And so we went and on my bucket list it

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.975
was high up on the list to be photographed
in a bathing suit next to Kate Hudson.

00:00:51.975 --> 00:00:56.819
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; That was really cool.

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:59.122
And Goldie, Goldie is 70.

00:00:59.122 --> 00:01:05.450
She's in her 70s and
I'm the friend who they're like ugh.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.872
Amy'll take the pictures.

00:01:07.872 --> 00:01:11.720
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; They're like,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.858
is Amy the one with the kids?

00:01:12.858 --> 00:01:15.028
No, actually I haven't had kids.

00:01:15.028 --> 00:01:17.150
It's just like-
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.562
&gt;&gt; That's just, what's up?

00:01:18.562 --> 00:01:19.805
That's what happened.

00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:20.445
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] My God.

00:01:20.445 --> 00:01:23.303
&gt;&gt; That's me,
that's not a guy on the front of the boat.

00:01:23.303 --> 00:01:27.470
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; That's me, that's not a weird dude.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.963
&gt;&gt; We're back with the best-selling author,
Amy Schumer.

00:01:29.963 --> 00:01:33.517
And in the book, you talk about-
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:01:33.517 --> 00:01:35.478
&gt;&gt; You worked in a lesbian bar.

00:01:35.478 --> 00:01:36.603
That was one of your jobs.

00:01:36.603 --> 00:01:37.279
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:38.915
&gt;&gt; And tell that story.

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:43.001
&gt;&gt; Well, okay [LAUGH],
thanks for teeing me up perfect.

00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:46.414
I did, I was hired to work
at his lesbian bar and-

00:01:46.414 --> 00:01:47.100
&gt;&gt; As what?

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.762
&gt;&gt; A bartender.

00:01:47.762 --> 00:01:48.470
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.138
&gt;&gt; As a lesbian.

00:01:49.138 --> 00:01:51.866
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And I thought,

00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:55.727
first I thought great, no men.

00:01:55.727 --> 00:02:00.741
But I forgot it was going to be women,
all women.

00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:02.051
What should I get to drink?

00:02:02.051 --> 00:02:03.484
I'm like I don't know what do you drink?

00:02:03.484 --> 00:02:04.585
Get rubbing alcohol.

00:02:04.585 --> 00:02:05.335
That's what I do.

00:02:05.335 --> 00:02:07.687
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; But, and

00:02:07.687 --> 00:02:10.261
then I really thought,
they're all gonna hit on me.

00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:14.290
How am I gonna break it to
them that I'm straight and

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.926
no one ever hit on me, even once.

00:02:16.926 --> 00:02:19.420
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I was let go.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.086
&gt;&gt; That's very sad.

00:02:20.086 --> 00:02:20.887
&gt;&gt; Yes, it is sad.

00:02:20.887 --> 00:02:21.569
&gt;&gt; It's very sad.

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:22.479
&gt;&gt; And you were let go.

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:23.102
It was let go.

00:02:23.102 --> 00:02:23.733
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:25.633
&gt;&gt; They said, we're letting you go.

00:02:25.633 --> 00:02:27.999
I mean,
it's like I didn't ask to go, how is it-

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:33.036
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I have a story and

00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:36.352
pictures of stuffed animals,
weird stuffed animals.

00:02:36.352 --> 00:02:37.290
&gt;&gt; These are so cute.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.408
I'm sorry, what are some things?

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:41.178
&gt;&gt; They are very strange and
your boyfriend is freaked out also.

00:02:41.178 --> 00:02:44.082
&gt;&gt; He does not care for
these stuffed animals.

00:02:44.082 --> 00:02:45.184
That's the gang.

00:02:45.184 --> 00:02:48.190
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and he gets really mad at me.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.230
He's get them out of our bed.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.578
They look disease ridden.

00:02:51.578 --> 00:02:54.970
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And it's not cute.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.516
And I'm just like, don't make me-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:56.516 --> 00:02:57.631
&gt;&gt; Choose them or you, cuz you know.

00:02:57.631 --> 00:03:00.840
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You know which way it'll go.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.620
&gt;&gt; Well, I got so he's gonna be mad at
me cuz I got something to add to this.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.088
We found this online.

00:03:06.088 --> 00:03:07.035
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:07.035 --> 00:03:10.643
&gt;&gt; And, we all debated whether to just
keep it cuz we really wanted to keep

00:03:10.643 --> 00:03:15.213
it ourselves but, I mean-
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:03:15.213 --> 00:03:19.634
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:03:19.634 --> 00:03:20.460
&gt;&gt; Ben,

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.271
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:23.395
