00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.969
Okay, so let's get right into it.

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.429
9 Things that Turn Off Potential Customers.

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.240
Listen, very rarely will anybody talk about
this.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.199
I can almost tell you, you can't find many
articles or videos online that are actually

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.599
going to address these issues because it doesn't
necessarily help with subscription or fan

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.329
base or any of that stuff.

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:23.329
But I think it's so necessary.

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.470
If you're trying to be a professional entrepreneur
or CEO, if you're really trying to scale yourself

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.079
to the highest level, do you want to get all
of the weeds out of the way that are preventing

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.050
you from having a bigger, stronger relationship
with business people?

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.610
This is one of the things that I think is
going to be important to be thinking about.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.650
Okay, 9 Things that Turn Off Potential Customers

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.090
#1 Somebody who smokes cigarettes.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.740
Okay, so let's talk about cigarettes.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.140
Why cigarettes?

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.829
So, this week, my father was in town from
L.A. visiting and we typically have a certain

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.320
sushi joint that we go to that I like in Dallas
and so this time it was closed.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.320
So I took him to a new one.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.970
I looked online and I saw a spot about a half
a mile away from my house that was 4 and a

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.000
half stars, 88 reviews, 4 and a half stars.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.670
So, let's go to it.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.759
So we went to this place and I'm sitting there
and the waiter comes.

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.090
The waiter comes, and he's standing a foot
away from me, getting ready to take the order.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.299
I'm sitting, he's over here [to the side]
and I start smelling cigarette.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.540
Heavy cigarette.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.150
Immediately, in my mind, I'm checked out.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.499
I'm never going to go to this sushi spot ever
again.

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:31.459
Now you may say, "Pat, you're judgmental for
doing that."

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:32.459
Not at all.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:33.759
I'm the customer.

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:34.959
I'm buying.

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:39.509
I want to go to a place that I buy that I
feel good, and the service is good.

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.819
Now you may say, "Well Pat, how do you know
the service is bad?"

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:43.740
It's not about how I know the service is bad.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.399
The mind is an imaginative mind.

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.630
So my mind immediately went to this.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.829
My mind went to "Ahh, man.

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.700
He probably had a smoke break and he probably
smoked multiple cigarettes because he smells

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.380
pretty strong on the cigarette side.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.609
And, I don't know if he's washed his hands.

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:03.380
He may or may not have washed his hands.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.740
And he's going to go out there and carry my
plate and he's going to bring my plate.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.490
And I'm going to hold it and I'm going to
smell the cigarettes.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.679
And it's going to bother me.

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.510
I can't eat the sushi.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.080
So in my mind, we stayed, because nothing
else was open.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.730
This was Memorial Day weekend.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.720
Nothing else was open.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.470
The bill ended up being $121.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.470
I eat sushi twice a week.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.100
The other sushi spot that I like to go to
is 4 1/2 miles away from my house.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.470
This is a half a mile away from my house.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.470
Watch this.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.470
$121.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.050
Let's just say that I go there once a week.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.380
$121 times 52 weeks in a year.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.510
You know how much money that is?

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:45.680
It' roughly $6300 per year.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.750
If I go there for five years, five times $6300,
that's $31,000 they lost over a five-year

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.290
period.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.080
If I go to sushi spots, I always take friends
and family.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.560
So imagine the people that I take to introduce
to this sushi spot, okay?

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.220
That adds another $60,000.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.160
That's $100,000, $90,000 potentially this
restaurant owner lost that he doesn't know

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.160
about.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.330
You see if I owned a restaurant, one of my
first questions would be, "Do you smoke cigarettes?"

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.900
Because customers don't like smoking cigarettes.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.670
Their imagination goes to a whole different
place.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.870
So #1 is cigarettes.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.510
In sales, if somebody comes to my house and
they want to sell me something, and I smell

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.461
the cigarettes, I'm automatically checked
out because I can't wait for them to leave,

00:03:26.461 --> 00:03:27.790
because I don't like the smell.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.440
And believe it or not, most people don't like
the smell of cigarettes.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.040
I'm not trying to harp on this.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.640
I did a Facebook Mentions a couple of weeks
ago and I brought this up.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.500
Somebody got very upset about the fact that
I said cigarettes, but it's just the reality

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.500
part of it.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.121
You lose a big chunk of business by smoking
cigarettes, if you're in the -- now if you're

00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:48.150
business is all purely calling and no one
can smell it, thank God, they can't smell

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.650
the cigarettes over the phone.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.720
But if it's something you're touching people,
you've got to realize that it's effecting

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.840
your business.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.040
#2: Odor

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.040
Hygiene.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.900
Let me explain what I mean by odor/hygiene.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.180
Yellow teeth.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.260
Yellow teeth is a turnoff when someone is
buying something from you or doing business

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.260
with you.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.560
This is if you are in the service or sales
business or you're in the sales world or business

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.710
where you're an entrepreneur, where your image
matters a lot.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.400
Your entire image matters a lot, right?

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.400
So odor.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.400
Let's talk about odor.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.040
Yellow teeth is a by product of what?

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.260
It's either alcohol, coffee or it's cigarettes,
right?

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.850
So all those three cause yellow teeth and
it could be a part of you not brushing your

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.590
teeth twice a day.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.180
It could be a part of you not doing teeth
whitening, all those stuff could be a part

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.180
of it.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.180
It's a turn off in the world of business.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.770
Another part of odor is B.O. - body odor.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.800
The challenge with body odor is, you will
rarely know if you have body odor because

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.880
you don't smell yourself.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.650
You've been with yourself for 25 years.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.400
You're not going to smell your own body odor.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.511
But generally, you know how everybody has
a friend that's pretty honest with them?

00:04:57.511 --> 00:05:00.510
Or a relative or brother or sister or a family
member.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:01.510
Ask that person.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.870
Don't ask the person that's afraid to tell
you the truth.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.200
Ask the person that's pretty direct.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.200
Look what they'll tell you.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.360
"Yeah, you smell a little bit."

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.360
Okay, great.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.360
Right?

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.360
Does that make sense?

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.360
Now I know that I need to adjust.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.389
So body odor.

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.440
Shower twice a day, once in the morning, once
at night.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.520
Don't go to sleep without showering.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.850
Wake up in the morning with a shower.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.720
Just make sure your body odor is. . . and
if you're going to do body odor, maybe shower

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.160
with something that has as decent scent.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.810
Another one is an excessive amount of cologne.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.580
Some people you know, you go to a nightclub
and everywhere it's cologne, cologne, cologne,

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.940
thinking girls like this.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.760
Gentlemen, cologne goes like this -- once
here boom boom boom boom boom (on one wrist,

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.860
rub wrist together and then wrist rubbed on
face) boom, boom boom.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.860
That's it.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.000
You don't need any more than that.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.570
When you do too much, you're over compensating
for something you are hiding.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.680
That's all part of B.O.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.200
Body odor and hygiene.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:56.740
Next, one of the turn offs and why you lose
potential customers is small lies.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.139
When you're telling a presentation and you
catch a lie here and a lie here [snaps finger]

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:02.139
you lose me.

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:04.140
I'm automatically not doing business with
you because if you can tell me three, four,

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.010
five lies in a row, you're probably going
to give me a big lie as well, right?

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.590
So I'm paying attention for things that are
inconsistent with the presentation you're

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:12.590
giving.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.100
So it's very important for you to not have
any small lies being done in your world as

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.960
you're doing business.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.320
Next one, #4, too pushy.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.190
If you're too pushy, people don't like too
pushy sales people because it reminds us of

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.740
car salesmen or reminds us of certain whatever
it is.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.750
. . too, too pushy, I don't like.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.770
I'd rather have you take a little more effort
than try to push me on buying something, which

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.920
I'm going to cancel tomorrow anyways, so what's
the real benefit of you pushing me to buy

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.120
something today, right?

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.360
Then the complete opposite side is like right
now, people said, "Yeah, I'm not like that,

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.620
this is why you know, my customers love me."

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.740
Yeah, but you're not closing them much.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.770
So your effort also doesn't work.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.630
Then there's the people that are way too soft.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.120
This is the 5th turn off.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.120
Way too soft.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.120
[spoken with a soft, timid voice]: "Would
you like this?

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.479
Do you want to buy this?Do you wan to give
us a shot?

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:56.591
What do you think about this?

00:06:56.591 --> 00:06:57.880
Is this okay?"

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.919
That's also a turn off, because my feeling
when I see that energy is that you don't even

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:03.139
believe in your own product.

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:04.419
I want someone that's assertive.

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:07.620
"So John, is there any reason why we shouldn't
do business together?"

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.870
"Um, yeah, there is.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.190
I have a concern with this."

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.190
"Okay.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:13.190
Tell me what are your thoughts on this area?"

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.290
Instead of, "Why don't you buy it today?

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:15.410
Why don't you buy it?

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.610
C'mon, man, let's buy it.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.280
C'mon bro, let's buy it today."

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.280
No.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.280
No, no, no.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.280
Questions.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.320
And then there are people that are too soft
and say, "Oh, you don't want to buy it today?

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.320
Sounds good.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.320
Thank you so much.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.320
Thank you."

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.320
I don't want that either.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.710
I want you to make an effort to close me,
right?

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.250
I don't want you to be too pushy, I don't
want you to be too soft.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.449
#6: Looking somebody in the eyes.

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:37.120
It's very important that somebody looks me
in the eyes.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.370
People like it when someone is able to look
at you in your eyes because they're not hiding

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.370
anything.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:42.370
Here's what I do.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.370
Here's who I am'm. . this is what I'm doing.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.410
I've got nothing to hide.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:46.040
If you want to do business, great.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.050
It's a turn off if you do one of this [looking
down] all the time.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.860
If you can't look people in the eyes, and
there are people that do, how do you feel

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.090
about it?I don't feel good about it and neither
do people who want to do business with you.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:56.889
So when you're talking to somebody, "How are
you doing, John?

00:07:56.889 --> 00:07:57.889
It's a pleasure meeting you."

00:07:57.889 --> 00:07:58.889
Boom.

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:01.850
Look a them in the eyes, okay?

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.330
Next, delivering on promises.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.000
Let me explain what I mean by delivering on
promises.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.770
If I do business with somebody and they tell
me, "Oh, the moment I leave this place, I'm

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.240
going to send you an email with a draft" and
all this other stuff, you should get it within

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.610
the next 30 minutes.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:18.389
If I don't get that email, but I get it a
day later and they use this sentence, "You

00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:21.610
know, I got caught up yesterday.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.670
. . " Anything they give me is an excuse.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:24.670
Anything.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.900
That person's probably not going to deliver
on their promises.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.520
And they're thinking about this.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:33.699
"Oh, tomorrow I'm going to have my assistant
call you and get all this stuff started."

00:08:33.699 --> 00:08:35.729
I don't get a call tomorrow from the assistant?

00:08:35.729 --> 00:08:37.490
Don't bother calling me the next day.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.680
If you're a professional have your assistant
call me tomorrow.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.779
And remind them and hold them -- oh, you know
what, my assistant sometimes, you know.

00:08:43.779 --> 00:08:45.950
. . No, it's not your assistant, it's you.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:46.950
You messed it up.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:47.990
By the way.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.880
These are mistakes that you make that somebody
points out to you and you've got to improve

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.880
as well.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.060
I'm simply telling you on areas that you may
be losing business that you need to get sharper

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.060
in.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.180
Next, facade, authentic.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.601
When I'm trying to buy something from somebody
and they're not being themselves, it's too

00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:06.080
much of a "Well, let me tell you who I am.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.080
Let me tell you.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.110
. . " It's too much of a facade and it's not
themselves, it's a turn off.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.110
It's too fake.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:13.110
We don't like that.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.640
We don't want to do business with somebody
like that.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.240
I had a guy that I did business with.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.740
"I'm the best mechanic in Upland."

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.490
The best mechanic in Upland.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:23.820
I had an issue with an S600 of mine and I
said, "Look, I'm selling the car next week,

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.740
but it's got an issue with the check engine
light.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:26.740
You've got to fix it."

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:27.740
He said, "No problem.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.060
He goes and looks at it and comes back, "Oh,
there's this major issue.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:36.860
You need a part that I can get, but it's going
to cost us $2500 to get it" and he knew I

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.160
was selling it the next week, right?

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.610
He knew that I was selling it next week because
he was the mechanic of a family member.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:43.620
So I said, "No problem."

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.250
I had no choice so I had him do it.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.320
And I go get it, and I drive it back.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.420
The next day the S600 gave me problems again.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.460
I took it to my local guy because Upland was
an hour and a half away from me.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.720
He said, "Patrick, I don't want to. . . is
this person a relative?"

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.770
I said, "It's someone that my family introduced
me to."

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:04.560
He said, "I hate to come in between you and
your friend, but I just want you to look at

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.560
this real quick."

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.440
So I went and looked at it and he did the
whole shimmy job, you know what I'm talking

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.660
about.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:09.660
And tied it up.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.810
And I called him and said, "Look at this,
what did you do here?

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.671
My family introduced me to you.

00:10:13.671 --> 00:10:15.620
What type of a business person are you?

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.050
Is this how you do business?"

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.701
"How dare you tell me.

00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:21.670
. . " I said, "This is the second day.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.040
This gave me problems.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.410
There's nothing that's been changed.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:25.959
Tell me what you changed."And he said.

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:27.450
. . "I said, "That's not been changed."

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.790
I had the mechanic talk. . . . and he hung
up.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.550
And that was a mechanic that was used.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:32.550
That's not transparency.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.550
That was a facade.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:34.550
It was an act.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:39.130
He lost my business and many people's business
around simply because he tried to get fast

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.240
money and abuse the customer.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:46.209
And then the last one I'll tell you, some
people have a hard time explaining this part,

00:10:46.209 --> 00:10:50.380
but I'm going to try to do my best to explain
it in a way that will hopefully make sense

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.660
to you.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.399
You know, sometimes.

00:10:53.399 --> 00:10:56.800
. . I was on Facebook Mentions this past Sunday
night.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.660
I normally do Mentions on Sunday night at
10:00, Central Standard Time, 8:00 Pacific,

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:06.110
11:00 Eastern, and we have hundreds of people
that join us on Sunday night.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:10.851
And one of the guys asked me the question,
he said, "Pat, how much does weight have to

00:11:10.851 --> 00:11:13.010
do with me being successful?"

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.620
And I said, "Weight with you having to be
successful?" and he said, "Yes, weight."

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.500
I said, "Okay, it's a great question.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.690
It's a tough question because I'm going to
give you my honest opinion."

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:20.959
He said, "Tell me."

00:11:20.959 --> 00:11:28.080
I said, " Look, whenever I am buying something
from somebody who is dramatically out of shape.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:33.800
I'm not talking about 10% above your body
weight that your body can carry.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:39.390
If your body can carry 150 pounds and you're
at 160 pounds, okay, I get it.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.630
165, I get it.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:46.040
But if your body can only carry 150 and you're
230 pounds, you lack discipline.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:51.070
Now I know that today's world in America is
so sensitive, so sensitive, that people are

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.870
very quick to post a message on the bottom
saying, "Shame on you.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.010
It's offensive.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:12:00.070
You're insensitive. . . . and you don't care
about people.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.720
All you care about is business."

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.720
No.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:07.490
I watch people who are extremely overweight
and I've had dinner with them, and I watch

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:08.950
their habits.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:13.600
Two cheesecakes, all this bread, all this
heavy stuff, at 8:00 at night.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.760
What are you doing have two cheesecakes?

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.790
You can't afford to have another cheesecake.

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:19.480
"Oh, I'm just going to do it today" is their
famous line.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.480
"I normally don't do this.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.790
I normally do salad, but just today, just
today, another cheesecake, another cheesecake,

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:24.830
another cheesecake."

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:29.200
And they're wondering why they're 50, 60 pounds
overweight.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.380
It's an energy issue.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.270
Listen, let me explain to you mathematically
how I see this.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.279
"Pat, what does this have to do with business?"

00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:36.279
Everything!

00:12:36.279 --> 00:12:38.830
Because if you don't have the discipline to
take care of the body that you're going to

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:42.830
live in for 80 years, what makes me think
you're going to have the discipline to take

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:46.060
care of me as a customer for three months?

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.060
Or six months.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.100
Or 12 months.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.740
I did business where two people were buying
and selling a house for me.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:56.610
One of the people that was selling a house
for me - this person was not in shape.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:57.700
At all.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.290
Probably 100 pounds over their body weight.

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:07.310
This other person that was my real estate
agent, this person ran five miles a day, worked

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:10.740
out four times at the gym, and exact, great
body shape.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.529
This person was 15 years older than this person.

00:13:14.529 --> 00:13:17.850
This person had kids and grandkids and everything
that they were taking care of.

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:18.850
This person did not.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:20.040
Watch this.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.890
Every single time I called the out of shape
person, not one time did they pick up the

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.350
phone call.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:26.350
Every single time.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:28.649
I called this person, they always picked up
the phone call.

00:13:28.649 --> 00:13:32.430
Maybe a phone call like this, "Hey Patrick,
I'm on the other line with a customer, can

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:33.649
I call you back in 10 minutes?"

00:13:33.649 --> 00:13:34.649
No problem.

00:13:34.649 --> 00:13:36.510
I could never get this person to pick up the
call.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:37.510
It's laziness.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.790
It's, "I'll do it later."

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:39.790
It's that mindset.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:40.790
Why?

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.360
Mathematically, watch this.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:52.280
If this cup [picks up a cup] can only carry
16 ounces and I try to force myself to put

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.000
50 pounds on top of this, what'd going to
happen with this thing?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.630
It's going to get crushed, right?

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:04.550
This body of mine is created to carry a certain
amount of weight.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:09.200
Anything above that -- and I've experienced
this -- my body can carry around 225 - 230

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.200
pounds.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.279
So if I'm at around 240 - 245, I'm good.

00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:17.010
If I hit 255, my body struggles to carry this
30 pounds.

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:20.160
Now imagine if someone were 150 and their
240.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.900
The body is carrying 90 pounds additional
that they can weigh.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:28.209
That's like constantly doing squats and you're
walking around all day with an additional

00:14:28.209 --> 00:14:29.279
90 pounds.

00:14:29.279 --> 00:14:31.670
Can you truly effectively work for 13 hours?

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.130
No you can't.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:34.750
You may effectively work for seven hours.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.589
You're yawning at 3:00 in the afternoon.

00:14:37.589 --> 00:14:38.589
That's success.

00:14:38.589 --> 00:14:39.589
That's business.

00:14:39.589 --> 00:14:40.589
That's when the real guys get to work.

00:14:40.589 --> 00:14:45.100
I mean, the real competitors get to work -- they
start early, but they're getting to work at

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.100
three, four, five o'clock.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.410
I mean, they're like, six, seven, eight, nine,
ten, 11.

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:51.230
They put their kids down and they're working,
ten, 11 o'clock.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.339
When it's 12:00, they're still working and
boom at 5:30 in the morning they're up!

00:14:54.339 --> 00:14:55.529
Let's get to work!

00:14:55.529 --> 00:14:58.260
Because the body is picking up what it can
carry.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:03.750
So I'm not trying to tell you this, and believe
me, many people on this video are going to

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.660
love to share this video with other people
because they're afraid to say what I'm saying

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.350
in this video.

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:09.350
But it's the truth.

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:13.490
I've run a sales organization now since I
was 21 years old.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:19.560
And every single time that I sat with a guy
that was going through this, or a gal, and

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.680
I pull them aside, and I would tell them,
"You know I love you.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.080
You know I care for you.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.231
You know it's not just business here.

00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:25.231
I want to see you win as well.

00:15:25.231 --> 00:15:28.540
I looked at your numbers, and I'm telling
you, every time I watch you get tired too

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:29.540
early.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:30.540
You get tired too early.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.100
You give up too quick.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.440
Somebody on the phone call says, "I'm not
interested," you hang up.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:39.120
Every time you go out on an appointment, the
smallest thing happens, you can't wait to

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.769
come back home.

00:15:40.769 --> 00:15:43.730
And I said, "Your weight is an issue.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.350
You need to drop around 30 pounds.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:49.910
And I'm telling you right now, you dropping
30 pounds -- your income is probably going

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:53.540
to go up 50 - 100 percent next year if you
drop this weight.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.420
"Oh, Pat, you know.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.470
. . " typically the reaction is all positive.

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:01.160
"Pat, you're right, man.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.760
I've been promising myself to go out there
and get in shape.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.370
. . " so it's not like they're coming from
a place -- and I'm not trying to embarrass

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:09.370
anybody.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.820
But man, your weight plays a big role.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:16.050
If you're an athlete in sports, and you put
on 50 pounds, Clippers, Lakers, they're all

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:17.060
going to get rid of you.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.200
You're not going to play in the NBA for too
long.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.120
In the world of sales an business, you know
who fires you?

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.390
Not the Lakers.

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:24.720
Not the Yankees.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.570
Your customers fire you every single day by
saying no to you.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.839
And you don't even know it.

00:16:29.839 --> 00:16:31.459
It's a turn off.

00:16:31.459 --> 00:16:33.420
And it's something that you can control.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:37.120
To all my sensitive folks out there that are
going to say, "Shame on you because you don't

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.540
now what it is to be big boned."

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.810
I don't know what it is to be big boned?

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:44.820
Maybe I don't know what it is to be big boned,
but I know what it is to not eat pizza.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:48.940
The last time I ate a Big Mac was in 1997,
September.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:49.940
How do I know that?

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.560
Because I finished boot camp.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.690
And when I finished boot camp, I went out
and ate a Whopper and a Big Mac the same day

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:56.510
and threw up all over the place.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:57.510
And I used to work at Burger King.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.170
So I had many Whoppers and many Big Macs.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.070
I feel lethargic after I eat a Big Mac.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:06.780
I may eat a slice of pizza or two, maybe once
every two months.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.420
Because I know I'm now I'm now thirty some
years old, closing in on forty, and when I

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.640
eat, I feel heavier.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.990
My body keeps it now.

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:17.040
I used to drop it but it keeps it now.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.300
These are disciplines that you actually can
do something about.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.550
And I guarantee you that people want to do
business with somebody where the vibration

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:24.709
and energy is high.

00:17:24.709 --> 00:17:26.050
They feel good about it.

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:27.700
They do, and your weight plays a big role
in it.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:33.950
So nine things that turn off potential customers.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:40.040
And to some of you that had the guts and the
courage to watch the entire video here, and

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.310
some of it is pertaining to you [claps hands],
I applaud you.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.310
I don't know you.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:46.070
You don't know me, one on one.

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:47.299
Maybe we don't have a relationship.

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:48.971
Maybe we do and this will never come up to
you and I.

00:17:48.971 --> 00:17:50.200
But I want to applaud you.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.750
I want to applaud you.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:55.679
Because it starts off with us wanting to address
areas that are sensitive areas to want to

00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:56.679
improve in that area.

00:17:56.679 --> 00:18:01.300
If you didn't like anything I had to say today,
you are more than welcome to unsubscribe -- although

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:06.081
-- if you can throw me my pillow -- man, I
hope you don't, because we have a goal, by

00:18:06.081 --> 00:18:12.100
August 31, our goal is to get to 100,000 subscribers
on Valuetainment.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:16.860
I believe our channel is second to none on
YouTube.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:21.280
I see a lot of YouTube channels that are about
entrepreneurship . I see many of them that

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.950
are about entrepreneurship.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:23.970
But it's a lot of motivation.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:25.080
You can do it.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.740
You should do this, you should do that.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.070
But I don't see a lot that's about how-to.

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:33.350
This is why I believe we can go pound for
pound with any YouTube channel on entrepreneurship

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:35.660
so if you haven't subscribed yet, please do
so.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.870

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:41.720
entrepreneurs to subscribe as well.

Bye, bye.
