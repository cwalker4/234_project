00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.247
- This is Monique, man,
I'm telling you, oh--

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.140
- Babe, he be sayin'
it like I'm a problem.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.500
(audience laughter)
- Oh, you have been a problem.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.330
- Well, Steve, okay--

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.300
- What was it?

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.133
Let's go.

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:14.966
- Let's go.

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.580
- You started getting
labeled as difficult.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.440
- Yes.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.728
- Why do you believe that that happened

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:23.070
and do you see that changing and why?

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.740
- I got labeled as
difficult, my husband and I,

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.800
and my husband is Sydney,
who happens to be my manager.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.130
We got labeled as difficult
because I said one word,

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.200
and that was no.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.060
Now I said no to some
very powerful people.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.920
I said no to Oprah Winfrey.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.730
I said no to Tyler Perry.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.380
I said no to Lee Daniels.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.100
And I said no to Lionsgate.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.240
And the difficulty came in
when people that look like me,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.480
like Oprah, Tyler, Lee
Daniels, and I gotta

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.600
put my brother Steve on the list.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.880
Y'all knew I was not wrong.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.240
Each one of you said to me,
"Monique, you're not wrong."

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.987
And when I heard you go
on the air and you said,

00:01:03.987 --> 00:01:06.627
"My sister done burnt too many bridges,

00:01:06.627 --> 00:01:08.860
"and there's nothing
I can do for her now."

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.751
Steve, do you know how hurt I was?

00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:13.470
- You see, Mo, now let me give you this.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.059
Because, you and I had this conversation,

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:18.800
I thought you went about it wrong.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.890
See, I felt that you had
done yourself a disservice

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.900
by the way you chose to go about it.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.000
- Tell me how I went about it.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.228
- I was cool with your deal with Netflix.

00:01:29.228 --> 00:01:31.050
I was cool with you.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.040
The two problems that we had, number one,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.640
the boycott of Netflix,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.654
- [Monique] Yes.

00:01:36.654 --> 00:01:38.230
- we never gave people a point of action.`

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.620
okay, if we're gonna
boycott, are we gonna not

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.690
get subscriptions, are
we gonna turn it off,

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.820
are we gonna go down there and get signs.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.090
The second point what
was comin' to me was,

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.120
this problem you had with Netflix,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.840
is rich people problems.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.010
Cause they lookin' at us
goin', you talkin' bout

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.820
you didn't get millions,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.250
but you got this, you oughta be cool.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.260
- But when you say, Mo, what's
the way you went about it.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.250
And I wanna explain that, and
I thank you for saying that.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.250
Inequality is devastating
and it's extreme.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.360
And when people said,
Monique, do you think

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.300
calling a boycott was extreme?

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.580
You damn right.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.020
But isn't inequality extreme?

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.070
So we've gotta get to a place

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.380
where we're unafraid to say it out loud.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.480
What I would have loved, what I would have

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.510
appreciated from my
brother, was had you picked

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.110
up the phone before you
went on the air and said

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.800
Monique, you've burnt too many bridges

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.310
and there's nothing I can do.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.060
Say, I would've appreciated had my brother

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.600
called me up and said, Baby let's talk.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.390
Because you doing that was a
part of me being difficult.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.750
- But now, before that though--

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.583
- Yes baby.

00:02:45.583 --> 00:02:48.190
- Remember the moment on stage?

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.023
- Oh yes.

00:02:49.023 --> 00:02:49.856
- See, now that there--

00:02:49.856 --> 00:02:51.330
- That was a wonderful moment Steve.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.163
- No it wasn't, Monique.

00:02:52.163 --> 00:02:52.996
- Oh my goodness.

00:02:52.996 --> 00:02:53.829
- No it wasn't!

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.398
- That was one of those moments
I love that Richard Pryor--

00:02:56.398 --> 00:02:57.461
- See, no it wasn't

00:02:57.461 --> 00:02:58.994
- Whispered in my ear and
said, say it, you say it.

00:02:58.994 --> 00:03:00.910
- Richard Pryor did not tell
you to say those things--

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.288
- I'm gonna tell you
something, yes he did,

00:03:02.288 --> 00:03:04.822
oh baby, yes he did, yes he did!

00:03:04.822 --> 00:03:05.750
(audience applause)

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.120
I do not regret, as I said
on the Steve Harvey show,

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.232
I do not regret one moment
of that night on that stage--

00:03:13.232 --> 00:03:18.232
- Now Mo, now in case you
don't know, Mo told Tyler Perry

00:03:19.818 --> 00:03:21.841
- I wanna hold your hand.
- Oprah Winfrey--

00:03:21.841 --> 00:03:22.674
- Uh-huh-

00:03:22.674 --> 00:03:23.841
- And Lee Daniels--

00:03:23.841 --> 00:03:24.674
- Tell 'em.

00:03:24.674 --> 00:03:26.850
- To suck her private parts.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.120
- Not my private parts.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.080
- Well you said if I had one.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.913
- Yeah.

00:03:30.913 --> 00:03:34.345
- I want them three to
suck my private parts.

00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:35.178
- Yeah!

00:03:35.178 --> 00:03:37.484
- It wasn't private
parts on stage, so now,

00:03:37.484 --> 00:03:42.484
then I went houhhh, I quit breathin'.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.650
I quit breathin' for you!

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.483
- I didn't.

00:03:45.483 --> 00:03:47.540
- What happened to you, Mo, was when you

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.408
made that statement, the
narrative got flipped.

00:03:50.408 --> 00:03:52.918
It wasn't about Netflix no more.

00:03:52.918 --> 00:03:54.540
It wasn't about Netflix no more.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.840
The tension was all off
of where we needed to go.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.012
- That's before Netflix.

00:03:58.012 --> 00:03:58.845
- Huh?

00:03:58.845 --> 00:03:59.678
- That was before Netflix.

00:03:59.678 --> 00:04:01.070
- So good, so now when
you bring up Netflix,

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.500
it doesn't get no wind,
but you done just said

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.614
this to these three people.

00:04:04.614 --> 00:04:06.500
And these three people,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.333
- Yes.

00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:09.240
- Not because they're powerful,

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.950
but because of who they've come.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.789
And what happens is I told you,

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:15.630
we can't cure darkness with more darkness.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.430
- What we can do is cure it with comedy.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.450
And what I'm not gonna
do Steve, I'm never, ever

00:04:23.239 --> 00:04:24.790
gonna waver from my
comedy show on that stage.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.190
That's my gift, and that's my freedom.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.770
And what happens is, when you allow people

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.490
to start taking your freedom and your gift

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.010
and making it become what
makes them comfortable,

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.010
we then lose.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.450
When you called me with the
morning show on the phone,

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.900
I said to you, Steve, my family
is suffering behind this.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.840
And you all know I did nothing wrong.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.650
You all know my husband did nothing wrong.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.890
But none of y'all, in
real time, in real time,

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.040
was stronger enough to go publicly and say

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.120
we can't throw our sister under the bus.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.540
- Because, Mo, listen to me,
we fightin' two wars here.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.560
- What war?

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.970
- There's two wars,
it's what your issue is

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.430
and it's what the
perception of the issue is

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.670
and the narrative has changed.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.077
- See, I'm hearing what
you're saying baby--

00:05:10.077 --> 00:05:11.218
- No, Mo--

00:05:11.218 --> 00:05:12.100
- And I agree with it when
the narrative changes.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.930
But if all of y'all said,
this is the only issue

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.980
I have with it baby, when
all of y'all said privately,

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.810
to include Oprah, all
of y'all said privately

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.630
I've done nothin' wrong.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.250
- When you tell the truth, you have to

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.210
deal with the repercussions of the truth!

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.600
We black out here.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.541
We can't come out here and do
it any kind of way we want to.

00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:32.374
- Let me, oh--

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:33.750
- Listen to me, your husband--

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:34.583
- Yes.

00:05:34.583 --> 00:05:36.770
- Can't be the Sydney that
he really is out here.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.770
- Let me tell you something--

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.856
- That flexin', we gotta
flex a different way.

00:05:38.856 --> 00:05:41.389
- Let me tell you something,
let me tell you something--

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:42.690
- We out here in game,
this the money game.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.440
This ain't the black man's game,

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.800
this ain't the white man's game.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.970
- [Monique] It's the money game.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.439
- This the money game,
we in the money game--

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:49.272
- But I'm gonna tell you something--

00:05:49.272 --> 00:05:51.670
- And you cannot sacrifice yourself.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:52.972
The best thing you can
do for poor people--

00:05:52.972 --> 00:05:54.249
- [Monique] This is why I love my brother.

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:55.082
- Is not be one of 'em.

00:05:55.082 --> 00:05:55.915
You cannot help them Mo.

00:05:55.915 --> 00:05:57.255
- We're in the money
game, but let me tell you

00:05:57.255 --> 00:05:58.430
what the game is before the money game.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.122
- You cannot help them like that.

00:06:00.122 --> 00:06:01.237
- Before the money game, it's
called the integrity game.

00:06:01.237 --> 00:06:02.448
And we've lost the integrity
worrying about the money.

00:06:02.448 --> 00:06:03.281
- But Mo--

00:06:03.281 --> 00:06:04.114
- Wait a minute, wait a minute--

00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:05.270
- If I crumble, my children crumble,

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.050
my grandchildren crumble.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.780
I cannot, for the sake of
my integrity, stand up here

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.030
and let everybody that's
counting on me crumble

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.890
so I can make a statement.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.333
There are ways to win the
war in a different way.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.140
We got more right after this.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.057
(exit theme music)
