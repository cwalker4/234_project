TEN FOODS YOU SHOULD NEVER EAT.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.680
There are all kinds of stereotypes about food that exists in any society .

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.940
People wholeheartedly believe in some products health benefits, although there's often zero evidence to back them up.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.460
What's worse some of the most promoted foods can in fact harm you.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.720
In this video, you'll get acquainted with 10 foods. You'd better avoid by all means.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.700
Number 10 - Fruit Juices

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.100
Unless you've pressed your juice yourself or seen it made in front of your very eyes. Don't drink fruit juices!

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.239
Despite what you've heard about them, the abundance of vitamins health benefits and so on. The truth is a bit different.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.410
Store bought juices may contain some real fruit.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:07.860
But, most of their content is water, sugar, and, artificial flavoring. Even if you see the labels not from concentrate or 100% pure

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.380
Don't let this fool you!

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:18.260
Juice after being squeezed from different fruits is kept in huge vacuum sealed tanks where it can sit for up to a year,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.680
before being packaged. and by that time the juice has lost all its flavor.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.640
Which is why manufacturers have to add artificial flavoring to make it taste fruity again.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.500
This refers to all  the juices, you can find at the supermarket even the most expensive ones, as for the low quality ones ...

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.509
They're nothing but sugar water, artificial dyes, and fruit flavor.

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.579
Number 9 - Energy Bars

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.508
Unless you're an athlete who requires a high protein intake and has to eat every three hours.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.899
These bars won't be of any use to your health. Their ingredients aren't anything you can get from normal food.

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.839
Also protein bars and energy bars alike are usually processed products.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.099
Yes, they are higher in protein than let's say chocolate bars, but they still contain plenty of unhealthy ingredients.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.709
Sugar, artificial flavors, and sweeteners. Even white flour can all be found in a single energy bar.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.220
If your scrupulous and love reading nutrition labels, you can find energy bar types that are way healthier than others.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.329
But, in any case you're better off spending money on real food.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.370
Number 8 - Cereal

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.100
Our childhood and adulthood

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.880
let's be honest, favorite food and one that's been pushed on us our whole lives as part of a nutritionally balanced breakfast.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.060
And the only way to start your day is nothing more than a marketing ploy.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.820
In most cases thought, these cereals are loaded with refined carbohydrates and sugar.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.109
Even if the label assures you that it's fat-free and whole-grain check the list of ingredients.

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:07.119
You'll most likely see that the product is full of sugar. Breakfast cereals typically contain a teeny tiny amount of whole grains.

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:11.229
Which allows producers mark their product is healthy, what's more...

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.230
Manufacturers add some synthetic vitamins to the mix. None of which do your body any good whatsoever.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.650
Number 7 -  Margarine

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.829
Again, thanks to mass advertising

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:33.249
Many people believe that margarine is a healthy alternative to butter. But yet again, that's so not true.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.239
Margarine is a highly processed product that's made to taste and look like butter, but it's chock full of artificial ingredients.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.280
What's even worse this "fake butter" is typically made from industrial vegetable oils hydrogenated to become solid.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.060
A process that significantly increases the oils trans fat content.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:01.520
Yet, manufacturers can technically label their product as zero trans-fat if it contains less than a half a gram of the stuff per serving.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.340
But, half a gram is still a substantial amount and it can cause harm to your health.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.210
Number 6 -  Low-fat Yogurt

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.869
Nowadays, everybody knows that yogurt is a healthy nutritious product and that's mostly true.

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:27.369
The right yogurts can be extremely wholesome but, most store-bought varieties are useless and even dangerous for your health.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.100
Especially those labeled "low-fat"

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:38.950
The thing is that manufacturers load these yogurts with sugar to make up for the lack of taste usually provided by the natural fats.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.879
That means that the yogurt initially had healthy tasty fat.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.900
But after its removal producers have to replace it with something much worse.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.960
And despite common belief, most yogurts don't contain probiotic bacteria

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.590
Since, the process of pasteurization kills all those microorganisms.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.010
Number 5 - Ice Cream

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.440
Back in the day, ice cream was made with egg yolks cream sweeteners

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:16.269
Like organic maple syrup and pure vanilla extract as a natural flavoring and it was indeed one of the healthiest desserts you could find.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.720
Unfortunately today's ice cream is an absolutely different product consisting of synthetic ingredients.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:30.240
Instead of pure milk or cream, manufacturers use cheaper hydrogenated fats such as palm or coconut oil.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:37.839
On their own, these oils are pretty healthy, but after they've been heated and infused with metal catalysts to solidify

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:44.229
Remember that they become nothing more than trans-fats and when consumed they can cause high cholesterol

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.809
stroke heart disease and even cancer!

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.720
Ice cream is also loaded with sugar artificial flavors and synthetic preservatives.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:00.680
And if it's pink purple or red it's most likely been colored with cochineal extract or carmine.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.469
Additives which can cause bad allergic reactions.

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:08.509
Number 4 - Eggs

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.339
Eggs??

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:16.159
But aren't they one of the best foods out there full of proteins minerals and antioxidants.

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:20.149
How on earth can they be bad for you? Well to put it bluntly,

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:26.778
Easily, one egg contains as much cholesterol as a big greasy burger and although this is so-called

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:34.729
Dietary cholesterol that causes just a 10% increase in blood cholesterol levels it still damages your arterial lining.

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:42.258
Plus according to some recent studies eggs are no better than smoking when it comes to carotid artery plaque buildup and

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.490
Here's a real shocker. Even one egg a day can shorten your lifespan!

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:54.408
In a twenty year harvard physicians health study that observed 20,000 doctors.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.320
They found that those who ate at least one egg every day had much higher mortality risks.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.500
If you absolutely must include eggs in your diet choose those laid by range free heads

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.490
Number 3 - Microwave Popcorn

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.880
It's delicious mouth-watering

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.840
flavorful and an absolute nightmare for your health.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:24.760
Let's start with the bag, it's almost always lined with perfluorooctanoic acid.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.940
And yes, it's as scary as it sounds this is the same toxic substance you can find in Teflon pans.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:37.820
One of the worst things about this stuff is that it stays in the human body and the environment for an extremely long time.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.899
Not to mention the EPA has listed it as a carcinogen.

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:44.419
aka cancer causer

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:51.919
Popcorn also has some genetically modified ingredients as well as taste boosting chemicals and additives.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:57.049
This leads to health problems such as heart attacks, digestive issues, allergies

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.860
skin rashes,

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.700
breathing problems, and the depressing list goes on.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.740
Even more popcorn is extremely caloric.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:13.420
Salt, sugar, caramel and oil added to your favorite snack can result in problems with excess weight or even

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.120
obesity

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:21.640
If you want to stay healthy and enjoy the benefits of eating real popcorn as an additional source of some nutrients and fiber,

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.960
Stop buying microwavable bags from the store. Get a popcorn machine and make it at home yourself.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.799
Number 2 - Sugar-free Candy

00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:41.208
These candies seem like the perfect option for those who have a sweet tooth, but want to cut down on their sugar intake.

00:08:42.779 --> 00:08:46.429
But are sugar-free sweets really as great as they're presented to us?

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:56.220
The thing is that if candy doesn't contain sugar it contains artificial sweeteners such as aspartame sucralose and saccharine.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:02.920
These substances are chemically processed and may cause some serious side effects.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:08.620
For example, saccharin can increase your sodium levels and aspartame can lead to migraines.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:15.440
And even if, candy is sugar-free, it's still candy. This means that it's still high in fat carbs and calories.

00:09:16.649 --> 00:09:22.249
For instance, sugar free chocolates can be high in saturated fats thanks to the cocoa butter in them.

00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:27.829
Number 1 - Diet Soda

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:34.529
While diet soda can save you up to a hundred and forty calories compared to the "non-diet variety."

00:09:34.529 --> 00:09:37.318
There are more important things than calorie content.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:44.280
First of all diet soda contains artificial sweeteners whose flavour is more intense than that of real sugar.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.120
So if you consume a lot of diet drinks,

00:09:47.129 --> 00:09:49.760
they'll dull your taste perception over time.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.640
And naturally sweet products like fruit won't seem sweet any longer.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:02.220
Not to mention, artificial sweeteners can easily lead to weight gain as they trigger the production of insulin which makes your body store fat.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:11.129
If you drink just one diet soda per day you have a 36% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

00:10:11.589 --> 00:10:17.849
And lastly, after some time your smile can be seriously ruined as the citric acid contained in diet soda

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.100
weakens and destroys tooth enamel.

00:10:23.769 --> 00:10:26.758
Do you know any other foods that are detrimental to your health?
