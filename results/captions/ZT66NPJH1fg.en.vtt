Well as in A Following Video on november 8 good luck Everyone Now let's get to Today's Fan Fiction

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.779
Hey Guys, How's your!

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.230
Day Going so something that

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.520
Always Made me Sympathize With Obi one was the level of Pain that he Must have gone Through When Leaving Anakin There Burning to Death

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.270
On the Lava Riverbank This is someone who, was like a little Brother to him

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.719
Who he Spent Almost every day With since They Met and Taught him

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.780
Everything that he Knew in Respect to his Masters Dying wish

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:49.079
Now One Reason I think obi one aged so terribly is because I can't even Imagine the Nightmares that he Must have gone Through and

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.179
Had About Anakin Burning Limbless

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.430
Screaming at Him in Pain I think if They do Make the Obi-Wan Anthology Movie They

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.819
Should Incorporate all of his Post-Traumatic Stress from the duel and his

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.849
Sleepless nights to go with it now what if he Didn't leave

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.360
Anakin There to die what if he Walked Down the lavas Riverbank as the soft soil sled him Down with each Step

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.909
Careful Not to Fall Into the river Himself as he Fell to his Knees next to Anakin Looking at

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.399
What he Had Done and What everything had turned Into

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.659
How it wasn't supposed to end This Way?

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.169
He grabbed Him Crying and Telling him that he Loved him, how he Is his Brother and that he

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.909
Won't leave him There as Anakin Lay Disoriented in His Master's Arms his Eyes Burned With an orange Haze of Hatred and Fury

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.060
Wanting to reach out and choke him but Knew he

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.540
Was only A fragment of the man that he Used to be Staggering to pick up his

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.950
Apprentice Careful Not to Fall

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.839
Only One Held Him and Began to climb the high ground Walking back to Padme Ship as he Looked above and saw the Emperor Fly

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.999
Overhead he Had to Move fast she was in Labor and he Knew what he Had to do

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.979
Connecting With Master Yoda and Senator bail Organa on Polis Masa They immediately got Anakin

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.739
Into A medical Capsule and Padme to the Delivery Table

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.980
Separated By only a Piece of clear Glass Padme tossed and Turned

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:13.220
As she Opened her Eyes to the Shocking Image of A man Screaming in Pain as the medical droids began working his burned and limbless body

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.960
As Padme Began to scream in Shock not able to Keep her eyes away

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.169
Realizing By each Passing Moment that This was no Random man This

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.929
Was her Husband The Hero of The Clone Wars and the most Powerful Jedi to someday be Anakin Skywalker?

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.869
The Pain of The Twins in her Stomach and The Shocking Image of Seeing an Ax Came this Way Caused her To faint

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.109
Immediately Laying There Lifeless as Obi-wan Came

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.249
Over to her With Yoda and Stroked her head so she Would Calmly Wake Up and Proceed

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:47.449
With the Pregnancy as Yoda Frowned and Looked over Toward Skywalker he Entered the Room Where the Screams were now

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.599
Amplified No longer Dulled by glass walls

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.470
Coming to See Anakin who Didn't even Seem Human Anymore Just A feral animal and more Pain than Yoda has ever

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.979
Sensed A single Entity to be he Raised his Alien-Like Hand to send Healing Energy to Skywalker

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.120
Touching his Leathery Burnt skin

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.579
Closing his eyes and Beginning to Feel the Boy's Body Relax, his Screams

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.100
Beginning to soften and able to hear Anakin's Raspy Breathing he Could Feel something

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:22.939
Was wrong with his Lungs? They, were Set on Fire From the inside as he Started to Feel and against Pain Subside

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.859
Opening his Eyes in Fear and Shock he Used the Force to run to the other Room telling Obi-wan to leave Padme and to come

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.610
With him at Once, oh

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.860
Obi-Wan Had Already Been at

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.320
The Front of the Door when you two got There he Had felt it too as They ran past a confused bale who Followed suit

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.790
They Went Outside To See Clones Firing upon the native Inhabitants of the Planet as the

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:51.379
Emperor Stepped Outside of his Shuttle and Walked Straight Towards the Two Jedi Masters Surrounded by his Troops

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.140
"Fire" said The Emperor as the clones began to open fire on the last two Jedi Obi-Wan

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:04.669
And Yoda Knew that they must Finish it Quickly before Sidious used the advantage to go to Anakin Without even Igniting his lightsaber or

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.549
Hesitating Yoda Through all the Clones Into the air and Pulled them together Breaking all Their Bones and Necks

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.770
Cropping Up before Sidious who Smirked in Admiration Master Yoda

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.369
Such a violent act of a pitiful Jedi

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:26.209
Igniting his spare Red Lightsaber and Twirling Into Kenobi With the Dark Side of the force Screaming as he did Just before Fighting mace Windu

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.659
Unfortunately for The Emperor Obi-wan was a Master of source Soup deflecting the Attack with ease as Yoda

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.100
Jumped Behind Sidious and ignited his green saber This was Surely a match

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:44.179
Match that Would Harness all of The Emperor's Powers Any Falter in his Technique and he Knew The result Could be Fatal

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.279
Sidious Move to the Side and Push the Aura Into the stone Wall far Behind Him Master Yoda

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.360
Knew what he was trying to?

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.620
Do he Wanted to split them Up he Knew that if he Killed the Weakest Link first

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.339
Then who Would be able to Continue what They never Finished in The senate?

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.969
Swinging his lightsaber Towards, Obi wan's skull Yoda was impressed at. How much of a Master of Blocking attacks will be won

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.929
He, was surely Proud his Fellow Jedi Master Could See?

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:09.319
why he

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:11.310
was able to stand up to Anakin and

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.679
Grievous the Way that he did as Obi-wan was Thrown to the Floor Yoda Knew he?

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.069
Couldn't Take This Barrage of Speed and Power From The Emperor for much longer

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.869
When Cities felt A massive Body hit him From the Side Turning to Look and being Astonished at what

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.299
was in The air it was Master Yoda he Had Raised all of the Cloned Bodies Into the Sky

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:37.968
Spinning Them using the Force as he Closed his eyes and Shot them at member With Inhuman Speeds

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.539
Sidious Smirks Blood We've Been Training Practice

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:47.899
Swinging his lightsaber as A Cleaning Game he Sliced and Slashed Through every Limb and Torso that came at him

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.969
Dropping His Red Weapon to the Floor and Sending a Shockwave of Force Typing Bodies

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:59.539
Incinerating Better Suited us as he Loved and Levitated his lightsaber Into the air

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.289
Igniting it Turning to Obi-Wan and See

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:23.239
