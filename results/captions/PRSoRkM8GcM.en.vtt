00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.550
Hey guys ChrisFix here and today

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.599
I'm going to show you how to super clean your engine bay so clean that you'll be able to eat off of it and

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.519
No, I am not joking after you guys saw this engine Bay in one of my videos

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.099
I got thousands of comments from you asking

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.529
What's the best way to clean your engine and I got so many requests from you guys that this became the most requested

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.399
video ever so as usual. I'm going all out in this video

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.469
I have a bunch of different vehicles with different engine based setups that are dirty in different ways

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.270
Starting with the Driftstang which has a dirty engine that's covered mostly in grease and oil

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:43.019
So we're going to go from this to this and with the Jag(Jaguar) we have the classic Daily driver dirty Engine Bay

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.629
That's just dirty from well driving it daily

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.469
so here's our before and then

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:54.509
the after and then we have a truck with a dirty engine that's covered in mud which was from driving through a

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.640
puddle or two and

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.539
this engine is going to go from this to this and

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.499
Finally we have a van that's over 20 years old with over

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.250
300 thousand miles on her and not only is this engine bay dirty

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.769
but we have a bunch of rusted parts that I'm going to show you how to clean up to make this engine look great and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.689
The best part is after watching this video

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.809
You're going to be able to super clean any engine and make it look brand new just like you saw using these common products

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.549
We have some microfiber towels which you buy in bulk because we're going to be using a lot different brushes

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.720
paint markers cleaning wipes spray Wax Trim restore

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.869
And Soapy wooder all these products are inexpensive

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.219
And I'll be sure to link them in the description below so you could easily find them so let's begin

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.360
The engine Bay Super clean process is real simple. Here's the breakdown first

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.489
We're going to prepare the engine to get cleaned then we're going to do a dry clean then a wet clean and then we're going

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.250
To dry the engine off and then detail it and don't worry

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.589
I'm going to explain each step as we go through it and to be sure I answer all the questions that you might have I

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.340
even asked you guys on Instagram what you wanted to know about cleaning your engine

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.960
So I'll be answering all those questions and more in this video, so let's get started

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.610
The first step is the preparation step and although it seems simple

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.100
It's important to have all your cleaning supplies laid out

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.920
Right next to your engine that's going to make it a lot quicker to clean the engine and a lot more enjoyable because your products

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.449
Are going to be right there for you to use it's also a good idea to put on some gloves to protect your hands from

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.179
Chemicals and oils and put on some safety glasses just in case some dirt splashes in your face now what you want to do next

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.240
Since we're getting the engine wet you want to isolate the power source

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.350
Which is the battery by disconnecting it and if your batteries in the engine bay like this

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.500
and it's easy to get to

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.369
Go ahead and remove it because that's going to make it so much easier to clean this area over here and get to the hard-to-reach

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.249
Spaces, but no matter what even if you keep your battery in the car make sure you disconnect the positive and negative leads

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.580
So we completely isolate the battery from the rest of the car and the whole point of disconnecting your battery is peace of mind

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.040
Everybody's big is concerned when you're cleaning the engine bay getting water in something that you shouldn't and then it shorts out

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.679
But with the battery completely disconnected there's no electric running through any of this, so you can't short anything out

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.250
There's a lot less to worry about and then when we're done cleaning and detailing the engine

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.330
we can make sure everything is dry and then reconnect the battery and we'll be good to go and

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.749
finally the last thing for our preparation step even though we

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.699
Disconnected the battery there are still some components that we don't want to get wet sure you can get a little wet

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.739
But you don't want to get them soaking wet for example. We have the alternator we also have the distributor in this car

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.219
We actually have two distributors, but what you want to do is you want to follow your spark plug wires

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.540
And this is the electronic distributor if you want you can press down on the caps here

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.689
Make sure that they're forced all the way down that helps keep water out, but these are water sensitive following those spark plug wires

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.910
We come over to the spark plugs and on this engine the spark plugs are at the top in most cases when the spark plugs

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.189
Are at the top you want to be careful because the water could sit in those spark plug wells and when water collects there it

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.529
Doesn't easily dry out, and you could have issues when we reconnect the battery so again these components can get splashed with water

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.719
But the idea is we don't want to soak them with water if we could help it another engine bay that's becoming a lot more

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.779
Common is one that's covered in plastic and usually these plastic covers are protecting whatever you don't want to get wet

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.530
So we just want to make sure we don't get water behind the plastic and with that being said

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.860
Everything under the hood is designed to get wet

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.149
That's why you could drive your car through puddles in the rain without worrying about anything

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.040
The only difference is we're going to be spraying water from the top, but we're going to be doing so with a light shower

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.709
We're not using a pressure washer and the reason why is these connections,sure they are water tight

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.720
but over time with heat cycles with

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.970
vibrations these become less and less

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:40.569
Waterproof so we don't want to shoot pressurized water into them even if it doesn't damage the sensor any water that gets in here even

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.890
in small amounts will cause corrosion and then over time you'll run into issues and

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.390
One last thing we want to be careful of that you don't really think about but you definitely don't want to get water in is

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.179
Your engine oil dipstick sometimes it's popped up

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.869
So you just want to make sure you push that all the way in so we don't get water in the engine oil

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.570
Same thing goes for your brake fluid reservoir. Make sure it's completely tight and your power steering reservoir again

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.330
Make sure it's tight and finally if you have an automatic transmission

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.889
and a dipstick make sure that dipstick is pushed all the way in and with that we are done with the

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.350
Preparation steps, so let's move on to the next step

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.020
the next step is to dry clean the engine and that's exactly how it sounds before we get the engine wet at All with the

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.370
engine completely dry

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.080
we're going to clean it reason being is a lot of the dirt and Debris that gets on the engine is just

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.050
dust and

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.980
Road grind that

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.819
settles on the top of everything so before we get water on here and get it completely soaking wet and then that water pushes the

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.230
Dirt into places. We can't easily reach. We're going to clean it and to do that. It's really simple

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.860
We're going to be using brushes

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.800
First since there's going to be a lot of dust get your dust masks on and it really doesn't matter what brushes you use I?

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.990
Like to use these brushes because they have a long handle so you could get into those hard-to-reach spaces, but we have a toothbrush

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.890
We have regular painters brushes if that's what you could find and then we have metal wire brushes

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.630
And I'll show you why we're using that in a second

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.760
So these brushes are being used to agitate all the surface dust but how do you remove that

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.159
Well there's a couple of ways and it depends what you have

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.010
I personally like using a vacuum that way you could suck it up

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.109
And we'll also use this later to help dry the engine

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.930
But if you don't have a vacuum then you could use something like a leaf blower

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.720
Or you could use one of these attachments on an air compressor to blow away all that dust and dirt

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.410
So let me show you how this works

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.799
We're using a vacuum and a brush together although the dirt here is pretty loose already and could just be sucked up

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.990
so where there isn't li-like around the sensors or hard-to-reach places work that brush in there and

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.850
Agitate the dirt so it becomes loose

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.749
And then you have the vacuum right there to suck it up, and you might not think this is doing much

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:40.059
But this is before the dryclean and this is after and that's all from just using a dry brush

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.500
So now you're going to want to brush off as many

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.470
Surfaces in the engine bay as you can this whole process is pretty quick, and it only takes about five minutes

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.149
And it's definitely helpful to have a few different sized brushes now brushes are great

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.489
But it could be hard to reach into these tight spaces

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.980
So an air nozzle like this that connects to an air compressor

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.989
Works awesome they get even more dust out of the engine bay and look at all that dust getting blown out

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.290
Another option is to use a leaf blower which also works well

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.890
and with some vacuums all you have to do is clip the hose around and

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.649
It will blow the air out instead of sucking it in

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:19.269
That's all it takes to dry clean an engine and we get a lot of the surface dust off the engine before we get it

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.200
Wet now. I'm done with this engine. It's completely dry creams, but one thing I want to mention

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.039
We have this intake here. Which is metal. It's aluminum, but it's in pretty good shape

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.089
It's also a small part of the engine on some cars like in this Jaguar

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:36.669
We have a large metal intake this is aluminum, and you can see there's discoloration on it stains

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.679
It's pitted and corroded, and it doesn't look good and since it's such a big part of how this engine looks

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:47.500
It's important that we clean this and what we're going to be using is a metal wire brush, and it's pretty simple

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.809
We just rub the metal wire brush back and forth and you could do this entire job with a metal wire brush

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:58.239
But this is pretty big so if you have a rotary tool like this one with a metal wire

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.640
Attachment will make cleaning this a lot

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:06.909
Easier it also tends to come out a little bit shinier when you're using the rotary tool rather than by hand you want to make

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:10.660
Sure that you're careful around any plastic discs like centers or rubber hoses?

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:17.200
And look at how much better that looked now once we clean the rest of the engine Bay

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.259
It's going to look even better. Want know what here you go?

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:25.569
This is what it looks like what a nice and clean engine bay you can see that aluminum really sets it off

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.919
It makes it look great, but you don't necessarily need to clean this in every car for example

00:08:29.919 --> 00:08:32.588
I already super clean the engine in this Ford fiesta

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:35.979
And I didn't touch the aluminum at all and this still came out great

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.189
And in this van the engine bay doesn't have a lot of aluminum

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:44.410
But what we do have is is aluminum right here for the lettering and I think if we polish this up it looked good against

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:45.470
the black intake

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:51.319
So it just takes a few seconds to run the wire wheel across this and clean it up real nice and for just a couple

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:56.419
Of seconds of work look at how good that looks and once we clean this up and get that dark black the silver and black

00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:02.510
Contrast is going to look awesome. And that is all for step two dry cleaning your engine a couple of brushes

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:07.519
Dusting the engine off vacuuming it up and that gets us ready for the next step

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.410
and

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:16.700
Our third step the step that gets everybody nervous is the wet cleaning step this is where we take a hose and we wet down

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:17.450
the Engine Bay

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:21.890
But you don't have to worry I'm going to show you everything you need to know so you don't damage your engine and this is

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.890
Actually a lot easier than everyone makes it out to be

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:30.049
Now a common question is should you clean the engine when it's warm or cold and the answer to that is you could clean it

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.450
When it's warm or cold if you're going to clean a warm engine

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:36.710
Just put your hand on top of it and make sure you could comfortably keep it there if it's too hot let the engine cool

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:42.769
Down you don't want to put cold water on a hot engine because it causes the metals to contract quickly and that could either warp

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:44.300
or crack engine parts

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:49.130
But a warm engine is definitely better to clean on than a cold one because all that dirt grime and grease

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.189
Comes off easier when it's warmer just think about cleaning dishes

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:57.229
You clean dishes with warm water not cold water, but you can't clean an engine when it's cold in this case

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.310
I'll be cleaning a cold engine

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:03.080
So you'll see how it comes out and let me show you what we're going to using the cleaner again not too many materials

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.270
We have our hose we have these cleaning wipes

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:12.410
Soapy water a garbage bag some microfiber towels and an assortment of brushes and pipe cleaners the first thing we're going to do is grab

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.289
Our garbage bag because we're going to be cleaning the top first

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.050
We're going to be working our way top down everybody forgets the hood

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.770
But that's a pretty important part

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:24.139
So what you want to do is you want to cover the bulk of the engine you don't want a lot of water getting on

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.850
Top of the engine it's okay to get off to the sides

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.780
But you definitely don't want to soak the top of the engine and this goes for any engine

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:34.309
You're cleaning whether in a truck an engine that already has a plastic cover or an engine

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:40.310
That's mostly covered by the wiper shroud you should always cover the engine to play it safe. So for the wet cream process first

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:46.339
we're going to clean the hood and then we're going to clean the outside of the engine Bay and then we're going to remove the

00:10:46.339 --> 00:10:48.919
garbage bag and clean the actual engine itself

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.950
So let's get back to the mustang and start cleaning the hood

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:57.650
First you want to hose down the painted surfaces on the hood and that garbage bag is working great to keep that engine dry

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:00.040
Since our hood liners dirty rinse that off as well

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:05.230
But if your hood liner is sagging or looks delicate don't get it wet because water is only going to make it work

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:10.959
But this one's in good shape to have no problem storing it down next grab a degreaser like Soapy water and spray down the hood

00:11:10.959 --> 00:11:17.709
Liner and painted surfaces now with a microfiber towel simply wipe down the painted surface and remove the dirt and grease it should come off

00:11:17.709 --> 00:11:24.219
Pretty easily if your hood liner is really dirty use some carpet cleaner and let it soak carpet Cleaner works great on Hood liners

00:11:24.319 --> 00:11:29.559
Finally rinse everything down with water and wash all the dirt away now. I can still see some stains over here

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.169
I'm going to show you how to fix that in our last step but for now

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.170
Let's go clean the Engine Bay before

00:11:34.189 --> 00:11:36.170
Removing the bag we want to clean the entire

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:40.810
Outside of the Engine bay so pick a side to start on I'm going to start here and work my way around

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:47.469
First rinse down this part of the engine bay to remove all the surface dirt don't use a high-pressure jet setting which could force water

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:54.160
Into electrical Connectors next grab a cleaning wipe and wipe down the easy-to-reach surfaces the cleaning wipes not only absorb the dirt

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:59.920
But it helps remove the oil and grease and you can tell this is getting clean because check out how dirty this wipe is now

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.750
We want to rinse away all that dirt that we loosened up, and then grab your favorite degreaser in this case

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:05.680
I'm using Soapy water

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.649
Which is just a squirt of dish soap and the rest filled with warm water

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:15.159
Generously spray down the entire area and I like using dish soap because it's strong enough to clean the grease but it also won't degrade

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.089
The metal or the rubber or plastic

00:12:17.089 --> 00:12:23.078
Surfaces in the engine bay then grab a brush and wipe down every surface that you could reach the more surfaces that you could brush

00:12:23.079 --> 00:12:29.138
The cleaner the finished products going to be so for any really tight spots you could grab your pipe cleaner and these work awesome for

00:12:29.139 --> 00:12:33.459
Getting into those spots you can't normally get into and finally we just loosened up all that dirt

00:12:33.459 --> 00:12:35.410
Which is still sitting in that engine bay

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:41.079
So to remove it rinse it away with the hose now repeat this process for the rest of the engine Bay spray it down

00:12:41.319 --> 00:12:43.959
Wipe it down Rinse spray the Degreaser

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.519
agitate with a brush

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:51.638
And then rinse it all away each side should take about five minutes to thoroughly clean and it's really not difficult to do

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.789
And with everything around the engine bay cleaned up now

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:58.689
we want to carefully remove that bag so you don't get water all over the engine and

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:03.819
The bag trick does a great job at keeping your engine dry and at this point

00:13:03.819 --> 00:13:09.099
We're at the hardest part of this whole process we're going to be cleaning the engine and we have a big V8 engine here

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.309
So we have a lot of area to cover if you have a smaller 4-cylinder engine

00:13:12.309 --> 00:13:13.119
It's a lot quicker

00:13:13.119 --> 00:13:16.839
But as you could tell we have a ton of hoses and wires and just a lot of little

00:13:16.999 --> 00:13:22.179
Crevices to get into to get this clean so that could get overwhelming real quick, but I have a bunch of tips and tricks

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.659
I'm going to show you to make it so it's not that bad and the first one is

00:13:26.089 --> 00:13:31.328
Split the engine down the middle and pick a side to start cleaning on so I'm going to start on the passenger side

00:13:31.329 --> 00:13:36.188
I'm going to be working my way from the front to the back and the tricky part to this is we can't use a hose

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:40.329
To rinse down the engine so we need to have good access to clean the engine

00:13:40.329 --> 00:13:43.808
But you can see we have this intake in the way, and you can just work around it

00:13:43.809 --> 00:13:46.419
But it's pretty big and it's going to make it difficult to clean here

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:50.769
so let's remove it just disconnect the two sensors pop off a couple of hoses and

00:13:50.869 --> 00:13:56.319
remove the intake which gives us a lot more room and the edit benefit is that we could clean this out of the car and

00:13:56.319 --> 00:13:57.160
More importantly now

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.769
We have a lot more access to the passenger side of the engine

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:04.089
So I'm cleaning the actual engine first clean off any grease and oil with your cleaning wipes

00:14:04.089 --> 00:14:06.128
We have a pretty thick layer of grease here

00:14:06.129 --> 00:14:07.939
but it's coming right off with the wipe and

00:14:07.939 --> 00:14:14.049
removing the thick grease like this is going to help the engine cool more efficiently because grease acts as a layer of insulation between the

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:18.039
Engine and the cold air around it and check out all that grease we removed

00:14:18.319 --> 00:14:21.969
Next spray down the area with soapy water and since we're only using a fine mist

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:23.589
We don't have to worry about damaging anything

00:14:23.589 --> 00:14:27.428
So you could spray it everywhere then use a brush to agitate all the dirty

00:14:27.529 --> 00:14:33.909
Surfaces and for any surfaces that you can't reach now's when you can use those pipe cleaners and get into those really tight spaces

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.379
Now if you don't have a pipe cleaner to clean those hard-to-reach areas and the little tight surfaces

00:14:38.379 --> 00:14:42.279
I want to show you something to use that everybody has and that is a toothbrush

00:14:42.279 --> 00:14:48.099
so wet down the surface and the stiff Bristles do a good job at agitating that dirt and cleaning it out a

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:54.339
Toothbrush also works really well on those tough to clean wiring harnesses now after loosening up all that dirt

00:14:54.339 --> 00:14:57.159
We need to somehow remove it and with all the other parts of the engine

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:02.139
We just use the hose and rinsed it all away, but unfortunately we have a lot of electronics here

00:15:02.139 --> 00:15:06.548
We have those spark plug holes and just things we don't want to get soaking wet. So instead of using the hose

00:15:06.559 --> 00:15:08.618
We're going to be using a microfiber towel

00:15:08.619 --> 00:15:09.860
And we're going to wipe everything

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:10.699
down that

00:15:10.699 --> 00:15:17.199
way the towel is absorbing both the soapy water and the dirt and grease we loosened up so basically we're cleaning and drying at the

00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:22.568
Same time and you can't worry about getting the microfiber towel dirty that actually means that you're wiping away the grease

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.040
Here's what a new microfiber

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:28.740
Towel looks like here's what the one that we're drying with looks like so instead of all the grease being stuck on here

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:34.560
It's getting sucked up into our microfiber towel now some spaces like back in there are going to be really difficult to get into

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.510
So a little trick grab your pipe cleaner

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:41.909
And then grab your microfiber towel and wrap it in the pipe cleaner and now you can force your pipe cleaner back there and make

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.690
It easier to get to those hard-to-reach

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:44.620
spaces all

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:51.810
right and with all that dirt and grease gun and cleaned up check that out that is looking so good, and we haven't even

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:56.700
Detailed it yet, so that's just clean once we detail it. It's going to look Brand-new

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.830
So I'm just going to real quick clean this up

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:05.159
Just like we did the other side and with that our engine and engine bay are clean so let's move on to the next step

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.180
now after cleaning

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:15.060
We're left with a wet engine bay so grab a microfiber towel a nice clean one and start drying everything down

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.659
This is actually a pretty important step you want the engine to be completely dry before

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.500
We move to the next step which is

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:25.200
Detailing and one thing you'll notice as you're drying your towel is going to start getting dirty

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.259
so you're also picking up that extra dirt that you might have left behind and

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:33.900
as you're drying you might see a spot like down there that I totally miss so just get in there with your towel if you

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.509
need to grab some Soapy water and clean it up and

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:42.749
Finally as you're drying you might encounter a spot where you have puddled water just like here and also in here

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:48.390
Make sure you dry those areas out good because you don't want any standing water for when we put the battery back in so get

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:52.469
Your towel in there, and absorb it or a little trick that works really well if you have a vacuum

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.220
Just suck that water right out

00:16:54.220 --> 00:17:00.810
So dry the entire engine bay absorbing as much water as you can and there we go with our engine completely dried

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:04.560
We are ready for our last step which is easily the most rewarding step

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:07.510
and

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:12.900
Our final step is a detailing step but before we detail the engine Bay don't forget

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:18.180
We have to detail the hood now washing this hood didn't come out as clean as I wanted it to and one thing you could

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:24.509
Do which looks awesome is pop off these clips and remove the hood liner since we already clean this and it's completely dry

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.570
I'm going to be using a black non flammable fabric

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:30.260
Dye to restore the hood liner now

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.740
Obviously, you don't have to do this if your hood liner is not bad

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:37.140
But this is going to make a huge difference for mine, and also they discontinued this for my car

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:42.359
So you can't even get a new one if you wanted and this is turning out nicely now as we let this dry

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:47.729
Let's detail the rest of the hood so grab your favorite spray wax and just spray all the painted surfaces

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:49.730
We're going to go all the way around

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:51.989
After we're done spraying grab a microfiber towel

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:57.960
And we're just going to buff in that spray wax right into that paint since we have our spray wax all ready now

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:02.159
we could spray down all the painted surfaces in our engine Bay and

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.800
then buff that wax into the paint and

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:08.489
this is not only going to protect the paint but it's going to make it a deeper red and

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:12.060
Now that all our painted surfaces in the engine Bay are detailed

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:16.649
It's time to detail all the rubber and plastic surfaces and in order to do that

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:20.460
We're going to be using a water-based trim restorer this dries non greasy

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:25.049
So it won't collect dust it restores a deep black color in the rubbers and plastics and it actually

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:30.150
Protects the rubber and plastic as well, and a mistake I see all the time, please don't do this don't use

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:34.769
WD-40 don't use motor oil don't use any oily or greasy products in your engine Bay?

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:40.109
Not only is it going to collect dust but it's going to damage those plastics and rubbers so don't use these so be sure to

00:18:40.109 --> 00:18:44.240
Use a trim restorer that's safe on plastics and rubber and what I like to do I

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:50.580
Like to pour a bunch of the trim restorer in one little spot like that then grab a clean brush get some trim restorer on

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:50.970
your brush

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:53.429
And we're going to start on one side and work our way around

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:55.240
so we'll start back here and

00:18:55.240 --> 00:19:01.440
Start brushing it into the plastics and rubber as you spread the product in and there's not enough just to have your brush into more

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.950
And spread it around right now don't worry about getting smooth coverage

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:07.499
Just make sure everything you want covered is covered on

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:12.300
Complex surfaces like the top of this distributor the brush is going to make it possible to get complete coverage

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:14.729
Just spend some time and work it in there good

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:19.200
And when you're doing is you want to make sure that you don't apply any product to the belt by mistake any product that gets

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.139
on the belt could cause the belt to squeak or even worse slip

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:26.369
After you're done applying the product thoroughly let it sit and soak for about 10 minutes

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:29.279
After letting it sit for a few minutes grab your microfiber towel

00:19:29.279 --> 00:19:35.069
And now we're going to buff off all the plastic pieces that we put trim restorer on. The idea is we let the product soak

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.200
Into the pores of the plastic and rubber now

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:41.010
We're removing that top layer, so it doesn't collect dust and so we could even it out

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:46.589
So you basically want to rub down every surface you touch with the brush to keep track of that parts you buffed with the towel

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:50.039
I work on one side of the engine and then when I'm done I move to the other

00:19:50.289 --> 00:19:54.299
Now after buffing the entire engine bay this is looking amazing

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.750
Check that out, and you could stop here

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:03.239
But I have one more step that I like to do using paint markers to really set this apart and what we want to do

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:08.459
is we want to look around the engine bay and just look for parts that look rusted or bolts that just don't look good for example

00:20:09.059 --> 00:20:13.918
There's one right here a rusted bolt like this has ruined the look of your perfectly clean engine

00:20:14.169 --> 00:20:20.669
Compartment so grab a metal wire brush and just clean off that rust and then grab your paint marker and cover that rust in black

00:20:20.669 --> 00:20:22.529
Paint and I know that doesn't seem like much

00:20:22.529 --> 00:20:27.029
But little details like that make all the difference and since we have the paint markers out

00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:32.849
I have one more quick tip that's really going to make a difference and that is working with faded lettering although this doesn't look that

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:34.919
bad this washer fluid only cap is

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:39.659
faded so you can grab your paint marker and just color the raised letters only and look at that

00:20:39.789 --> 00:20:45.000
Attention to detail like that is going to really set your engine bay apart from everybody else's and with that

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.319
Aww man! Just look at this engine. It's so clean we are almost done

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.649
We just need to put a couple of pieces in that we took out so let's go do that

00:20:52.649 --> 00:20:58.409
Let's add our cleaned intake and our cleaned battery and we can't forget about our hood insulation

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:02.640
that looks so much better than before. Here's the before and after look at that and

00:21:02.799 --> 00:21:06.239
Just to show you the car starts up with no problems. No check engine lights

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:10.550
There you go.

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:17.479
And that is how you clean your engine bay now this takes about two hours total to do and it's really simple

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:20.300
Just take your time and have fun with it and you'll get results

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:24.470
Just like this this engine looks brand new not only does this look good

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.660
But all the rubber and the plastic is protected

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.660
Plus you have an engine bay you could be proud of and if you really wanted to it's so clean you could eat off of it

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:37.040
As always all the products I used in this video are linked in the description
