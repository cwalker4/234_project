00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:03.168
AFTER THAT SITUATION ROOM

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.501
LEADER.

00:00:03.502 --> 00:00:04.736
LET'S LISTEN IF WE CAN.

00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:06.972
&gt;&gt; ALL THREE OF THOSE THINGS ARE

00:00:06.973 --> 00:00:09.808
NEEDED TO MAKE A LAW.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.810
ONE PARTISAN VOTE IN THE HOUSE

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:13.111
TOMORROW WON'T SOLVE ANYTHING.

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:14.813
I MADE IT CLEAR TO THE SPEAKER

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:16.815
WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN HAVING

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:20.185
SHOW BOATS HERE IN THE SENATE.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:24.055
WE ARE INTERESTED IN BRINGING UP

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:25.056
SOMETHING 60 SENATORS WILL

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:26.057
SUPPORT AND THE PRESIDENT WILL

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:27.425
SIGN.

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:29.461
IN OTHER WORDS, MAKE A LAW.

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:31.963
THE LEGISLATION AND HOUSE

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:34.299
DEMOCRATS ARE REPORTEDLY

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.501
PLANNING TO INTRODUCE AND BE

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:39.571
VOTED ON TOMORROW WOULD NOT BE A

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:40.839
SERIOUS CONTRIBUTION TO THE

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.807
NEGOTIATIONS THAT ARE GOING ON

00:00:42.808 --> 00:00:44.309
BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.013
THE IN COMING DEMOCRATIC

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:50.648
MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE.

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.053
IT'S NOT COMP SENSITIVE.

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:56.554
-- COMPREHENSIVE.

00:00:56.555 --> 00:01:00.191
IT IGNORES THE NEED OF BORDER

00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:00.558
SECURITY.

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.161
IT'S WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT IF

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:05.163
THE DEMOCRATS WERE GOING TO

00:01:05.164 --> 00:01:06.731
STAGE A SIDESHOW RATHER THAN

00:01:06.732 --> 00:01:08.566
DOING THE HARD WORK OF GOVERNING

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:09.868
THE COUNTRY.

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:17.542
NERD, A  -- IN OTHER WORDS A

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:19.344
TOTAL NON-STARTER.

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:27.519
THEY WILL MAKE LAWS OR WASTE

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.456
TIME ON SHOWBOATING THAT WILL DO

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:31.790
NOTHING?

00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:35.093
THAT'S THE QUESTION.

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:36.461
POLITICAL PERFORMANCE OR

00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:38.129
RESPONSIBLE GOVERNANCE.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.098
WE WILL GET A SIGNAL IN THE NEXT

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:41.132
FEW DAYS.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:43.134
LET ME MAKE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:48.074
ONE MORE TIME AS I SAID FOR THE
