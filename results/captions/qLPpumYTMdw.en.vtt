00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:11.900
Legends and folklore about mysterious creatures
are embedded into our culture.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:19.590
As we have gotten older we now recognise these
were merely whimsical fables.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.470
But what if they are not so mythical after
all and actually based in truth.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.290
What if these strange creations have been
living amongst us the entire time...

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:44.449
Here are 5 Mythical Creatures That Could Actually
Exist

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.210
Sasquatch Big Foot

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.129
When you think of Big Foot the image that
instantly comes to mind is the grainy footage

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.050
of a man in a gorilla costume strolling through
the woods.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.809
But there have been reporting's of large ape
like creatures across the Pacific North West

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.530
of the US.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.440
It seems like every day a new sighting of
the mysterious beast is reported.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:24.000
With so many sightings it is becoming harder
and harder to simply pass off as a hoax.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.330
Big foot, also known as Sasquatch, is seen
to be a large a hairy ape like creature that

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.180
resides in the deep woods.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.920
It is often referred to as the missing link.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.300
A long forgotten part of our evolutionary
history when we broke apart from our ape ancestor.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.470
Big Foot is a staple of American myth and
the big hairy creature has also appeared in

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.280
Native American folklore.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.600
In a report published by Pennsylvania State
University doctoral candidate Josh Stevens

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:09.100
in 2013, there was over 3,313 reports over
92 years of Sasquatch sightings in the USA

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.690
alone.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.269
Sightings of the ape put it between 7 to 9
feet tall with hair all over its body.

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:24.670
In 2014 in Jackson Country Missouri a woman
stopped her car when a large creature stomped

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.530
across the road.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.650
There had also been a number of other sightings
in the area as well as rock throwings.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:40.220
In September 2007 a local law enforcement
officer answered an alarm call on a ranch.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.980
While driving he had to slam on the brakes
as a 7 foot tall monster with thick brown

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.239
hair stood in his path before sulking off
into the overgrowth.

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.590
The officer stated "he couldn't believe what
I was seeing."

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.409
There are hundreds more stories similar to
these reported every year.

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.969
Could you be the next one to see this mysterious
ape.

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:15.529
Next time you go down in the woods you better
not go alone.

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:16.969
Fairies

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:22.440
Tales of fairies originated in Europe and
these mischievous creatures have spread throughout

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.639
the world.

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:29.719
Although these elusive winged creatures tend
to shy away from humans, sightings have been

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:31.459
reported.

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.090
Fairies have been reported a number of times
over the recent years in the United Kingdom

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.160
especially.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.319
In 2009 Phyllis Bacon took a photo of a fairy
in her garden in South London.

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:51.200
This shocking piece of evidence showed a silver
winged figure hovering over her lawn.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.609
It had distinguished legs, arms and a head
that seemed to glow.

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:05.010
Perhaps the most revealing proof of the existence
of fairies occurred in 2014.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:12.079
University Lecturer John Hyatt from Lancashire,
England took a series of photos over two years

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.480
which featured small winged people.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.540
He has insisted his photos have not been altered
in anyway and that they prove that fairies

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.850
truly do exist.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.600
A year later another photograph was captured
of the flying creatures.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.700
A mother of two photographed her family's
day out to a nearby forest in Northampton,

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.730
England.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.390
When she got home and looked at her photos
she noticed something quite peculiar.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:47.590
A mysterious flying creature was hovering
near a hanging bluebell.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:55.120
At first she passed it off as a fly but her
children were quick to identify it as a fairy.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.380
Sceptics are quick to blame these sightings
as insects or technical glitches, but that

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.080
just takes the magic out of it.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.400
Remember, every time someone says they don't
believe in fairies, there is a fairy somewhere

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:19.120
that falls down dead.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.340
Shadow people

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.200
Have you ever seen a dark shadowy creature
lurking in the corner of your room only to

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.300
switch on your light to discover it was just
a trick of your imagination?

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.240
But what if it wasn't?

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.900
What if these shadow people were truly watching
you?

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:45.330
Suffers of schizophrenia and hallucinations
often report seeing these mysterious shadowy

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.020
entities.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:53.690
These dark figures are also tied to sleep
paralysis, this is when your mind is conscious

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.970
but your body lacks the ability to move.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.730
People often see a dark figure watching them
from the corner of their eyes and have been

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.130
known to crawl on top of them.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.880
The victim is helpless to resist.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.410
There have been hundreds of reporting's of
these strange shadowy figures standing at

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.080
the end of your bed, doorway and windows.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:26.020
Shadow people are always described as very
tall, blacker than night and three dimensional.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:32.000
While some are harmless and take no notice
of you, there are sinister ones around.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.100
Shadow people stalking's are common and people
would often feel a menacing presence when

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.940
they are around.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.350
While some people only realise that the shadow
is nothing more than a trick of the light,

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.830
others are not so lucky.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:51.990
People have claimed to experience genuine
encounters and even see them in the day time.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:57.330
Shadow people do not obey the laws of physics
which has led many to speculate that they

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.340
are not from our dimension.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:05.230
If they can cross dimensions and time then
it would explain how they are able to invade

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.170
our dreams.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:12.330
There have been many sightings of particular
shadow person who wears a hat.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:17.280
This is something much more menacing with
glowing red eyes and people are instantly

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.620
frozen in fear when confronted with it.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:27.830
Some unfortunate people have seen this figure
creep up throughout their life, always watching,

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.130
always waiting.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:35.540
A young boy once woke up from his sleep to
see a tall black figure standing in his door

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.540
way.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.060
At first he thought it was his father and
called out to him.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.830
When it didnâ€™t answer he assumed it was
his sister playing a track on him.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:49.150
But it did not respond to any of his questions.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:55.990
Terrified he threw his covers over his head,
when he peeked back the mysterious person

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.570
had disappeared.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:05.250
Shadow people are often seen by many people
on their death bed, waiting for them to die.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:10.850
A cancer patient reported seeing a shadow
person hovering around his hospital bed.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:16.490
He begged his wife to take him away but the
shadow only followed him.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:20.120
Could these mysterious beings be death?

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.420
Guiding you to the afterlife?

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:48.070
Next time you see a dark shadow in your bedroom,
don't assume it's just your coat.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:09:02.740
Ships 

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:08.770
would vanish from out of nowhere and remains
of wrecks would frequently wash up on shore.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:13.640
These were often thought to be the destruction
caused by The Kraken.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:18.810
While storms, pirates and mutineers were the
most likely reason for the disappearance of

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:23.990
vessels, there may have been something more
sinister at play.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:30.510
These stories would only gain in momentum
when a Danish naturalist named Japetus Steens

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:35.010
discovered a large squid beak about 3 inches
in size.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:40.560
He concluded that the Kraken was in fact real.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:47.090
Since his initial discovery parts of a large
squid like creatures kept washing up on shore.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:52.680
Over time it was discovered that these parts
belonged to a giant squid.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:59.750
Giant squids can reach 15m in length with
some estimating they could reach 18m.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:05.860
These huge marine animals live at a depth
of 400 to 1000m with eyes the size of dinner

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:11.580
plates and two very long tentacles to snatch
their victims.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.620
The giant squid is an elusive creature that
resides in the deep.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:23.250
These shy cephalopods are so large and strange
looking it is easy for people to mistake them

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.810
as something more maleficent.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:32.810
Superstitious sailors wild imaginations could
easily transform a squid into a violent beast.

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:40.350
In 2016 a large mysterious creature was spotted
in Google earth.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:46.130
This sea monster was located near Antarctica
and has driven many to speculate on what it

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:47.620
is.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:52.880
While some has merely passed it off as a whale
others are not so quick to easily identify

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.240
it.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:11:00.630
Scott Waring of the UFO Sightings Daily and
said "this looks like the Kraken.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.650
It could be 60+ meters long with tentacles.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:07.350
That sounds like a Kraken to me"

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:10.310
The ocean is only 5% explored.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:23.230
Who knows what sinister creatures could be
lurking beneath our waters.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:27.800
Have you ever experienced the sensation that
you are being watched?

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.560
Do you hear bumps in the night only to discover
that you are alone?

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.960
You may have experienced a paranormal encounter.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:41.750
Out of all the mythical creatures, this is
the most likely one to be real.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:47.410
Some people are comforted by idea that the
dead walk amongst us, while others are less

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.810
than enthusiastic about this theory.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:55.740
Stories of ghosts have been told since the
beginning of time from cultures all around

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.540
the world.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:04.110
In 2009 a PEW Research Center survey found
that 29% of Americans say they have felt in

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:07.520
touch with someone who has already died.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:13.110
Thousands of photos and videos have caught
ghosts on tape yet people are quick to dismiss

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:14.570
the evidence.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:19.850
In fact there are said to be over 2000 amateur
ghost hunting groups in the United States

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:21.279
of America.

00:12:21.279 --> 00:12:28.470
A wide range of technology is constantly being
advanced to prove the existence of spirits.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:37.370
Scientific equipment such as Electromagnetic
Field (EMF) detectors, ion detectors, infrared

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:40.640
cameras, and sensitive microphones.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.320
All of which has yielded impressive results.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:52.260
Everything from eerie voices, flying orbs
and ghostly apparitions have been recorded

00:12:52.260 --> 00:13:20.480
yet the wider public continue to reject the
existence 

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:44.560
of spirits.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:14:13.060
Do you think these mythical creatures live
amongst us or are they just a figment of our

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.830
imagination?

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:18.820
What other mythical creatures do you think
could actually exist?

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.450
