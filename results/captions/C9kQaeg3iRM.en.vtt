00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:05.759
[Music]

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.210
So my Rich Dad said in the world of business

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.920
there's "E's" and "E" stand for employees

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.529
and employees he says you can always tell
who they are

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:15.939
by their core values and what they employee

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.090
whether the president or the janitor of the
company

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.150
will always say the same words

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.150
the words are

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.910
I'm looking for a safe secure a job

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.080
with benefits

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.140
that's what makes them an employee

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.310
because their core values are security

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.050
the other other one of the four is the "S"

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.940
or the small business owner or the self-employed

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.420
and again their core values

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.899
will cause them to use the same words which
are

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.129
if you want it done right, do it by yourself

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.819
"S" means they're also solo

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:44.559
but generally one person act

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.039
will operate by themselves

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.239
On the right side of the quadrant are the
"B's"

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:51.850
and what rich dad said the B's stood for

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.440
was big business or like Bill Gates

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.399
Forbes defines big businesses

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.249
500 employees or more

00:00:58.249 --> 00:00:59.780
and their words are different

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.420
yes, I'm looking for a good system, a good
network and the smartest people I know

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.510
to help run my business

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.140
so they're unlikely "S"

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.200
they don't want to run the company by themselves

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.140
they want smart people to run their companies
for them

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.220
And then the fourth of a quadrant is the "I"

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.250
And "I" stands for investor

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.470
these are people who have money work hard
for them

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.480
These people are people have people work hard
for them

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.230
And these are the people that work hard for
the rich here

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.390
so early on in my life

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.950
It was my my poor dad

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.460
Who always said to me

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.130
you know Robert go to school and get a high
paying job

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.210
and so my poor dad's core value was to be
an employee

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.090
he wanted job, security, promotions

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.320
a steady paycheck and all this

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.450
And so it was my rich dad who said to me

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.560
You know Robert if you really want to be rich

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.170
learn to build businesses

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.390
it made more sense to him

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.890
to work hard to build a business

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.020
something you owned

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.320
and something you'd pass on

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.810
for generation to generation to your kids

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.690
whereas my poor dad said work hard

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.979
but my Rich Dad said why would you work hard
for something you'll never own

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.759
and get fired from right away

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.389
again that was the difference in values

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:17.409
so my Rich Dad suggested I learned how to
be a business owner

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.420
and learn how to be an investor

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.659
and that's one of the big differences

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.269
on this side of the quadrant, these people
here work for security

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.469
they work for money also,

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:29.780
On this side over here

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.390
their key value that they want is they want

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.499
"Freedom"

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:37.620
they don't want to have to work at a job anymore

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.200
they don't want to have to work for the rest
of their lives

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.959
so the beauty of building a business and learning
how to invest

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.989
is very simply that this is passive income

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.810
you work hard for a few years

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.519
but possibly for the rest of your life

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.489
income keeps flowing to you

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.950
when you look..

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.249
at a financial statement

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:08.010
let's say this is this is Income, Expense,
Assets, Liability

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.790
okay

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.930
and as I explained in Rich Dad Poor Dad

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.749
your house is not an asset

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:19.919
so basically is most people have a house they
think as an asset

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.930
but every month is costing them money

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.099
through a thing called a mortgage payment

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.810
that's why they're broke

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.779
so what makes a person rich like what makes
me rich

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:35.230
is very simply I have

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.200
assets such as businesses I have the Rich
Dad business

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.139
Every month lots of money comes in

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:42.389
I also have real estate

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.950
I also have stocks and bonds and I have commodities

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.939
such as I am a partner in oil companies

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.840
and every month the cash flows into me

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.059
so this is the model of a rich person

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:05.079
so whether I work or not money comes in

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.219
okay and that's what makes me rich

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:13.309
Most people all they have is a mortgage payment,
car payment

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:15.290
college loan payments and all that

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.419
that's a poor person okay

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.980
So what makes the same thing that makes a
rich person rich

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.640
and what makes a well-designed business rich

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.910
is that as a sophisticated investor

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.450
let's say this is a rich business

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.630
when I wrote the business plan for Rich Dad
Poor Dad

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.810
this company now is that

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.850
I had to design in assets

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.490
So, one of the biggest light one of the biggest
assets rich net has

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.010
is we are a brand

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.120
and we license our name

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.710
so all over the world

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.630
there's about 60 people who every month send
me money

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.500
it was designed into the business plan

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.950
for example

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.800
with Rich Dad Poor Dad

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.060
Every month people like in Japan,

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.550
and China and Asia and Europe

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.410
every month they send me money

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.840
the second thing is every time I write a book

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.760
every month money comes in

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.570
when I design, my board game every month money
comes in

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.340
and whatever what else we have?

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.440
well we have seminars more money comes in

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.890
So every month, the business of Rich Dad gets
richer

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.530
and richer because we're constantly

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.190
setting up more assets

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.110
follow one course till you're successful

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.490
and so that's what I did in 1973

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.830
I signed up for my first real estate investment
course

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.800
and I just did it and did it and did it

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.250
You know I bought this one little $18,000
place

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.250
and I did it again

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.940
And I did it again and I did it again

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.970
until the point where I understood it

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.080
and then I went into becoming an entrepreneur

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.110
and I did it and I did it

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.560
and did it I'm still learning and

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.850
I'm still learning about real estate

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.190
and the reason In 1966 I got into oil

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.000
when I went to work for the Standard Oil Company

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.500
so today I'm still focusing

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.660
I invest in oil and oil and oil

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.720
and I don't diversify you know

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.720
doesn't mean they don't lose sometimes I'm
loose, sometimes I make mistakes and all this

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.880
but I just don't buy good

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.330
as with all the bad

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.030
if you're going to be successful as an investor
depend of

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.340
diversification is good for the average investor

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.720
that's what you want to be

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.900
Have a good life

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.520
but what I'd rather do is be able to know
the good ones

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.780
from the bad ones, the good investments from
the bad investments

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.780
the good advisors

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.350
from the bad Advisors

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.620
and what's good for me

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.830
and what's not good for you

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.390
because what I do is not necessarily what's
going to work for you

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.890
and vice versa here

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.160
So that's why I really think

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.500
instead of diversification or diversifying

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.450
the new rules of money say follow one course

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.170
until you're successful and then keep doing
it

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.770
because once you find that way of being successful

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:02.930
You can do it again

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.030
and again and again

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.000
Hi this video will continue playing in just
a few seconds

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.640
but first I want to let you know about a

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.340
special announcement from Robert Kiyosaki

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.800
Robert is running a special online rich Dead
summit

Seven ways to create a sustainable,

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.310
passive income for life

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.700
so that you can work less, earn more

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.590
and finally escape the rat race

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.270
you'll be given the tools, strategies, tips
and blueprints

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.660
that you need for making more money

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.180
and setting up systems that let your money
make more money

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.220
it's incredible

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.440
and the great news is that you

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.210
can have full online access to this

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.940
incredible life-changing system for just $1

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.420
simply follow this link or write it down

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.240
and type it in after watching this video

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:58.590
so that's www.richdad-summit.com

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:02.200
I make a lot of money but I give a lot

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.960
you know what I mean

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.800
it goes to biblical principle, the more you
give

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.260
the more you receive

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.620
so when I meet somebody who's not doesn't
have any money

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.930
it just means that they're not giving something

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:14.930
yeah

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.030
you know, so a lot of times

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.360
there's people who would like more

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.860
but they're not giving anything

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.400
so they're like my poor dad

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.960
you know he belonged to the labor unions and
he wanted to work less and get paid more

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.330
Well that's anti-religious to me

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.330
yeah

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.579
if you want to get paid more

00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:35.639
work more, give more that's how I see it

00:08:35.639 --> 00:08:39.550
you know my first investment was a little
18,000

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:41.190
dollar condo in Hawaii and

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.750
I made a lot earning 25 dollars a month

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.110
I didn't make much money on that deal

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.650
but every time I did an investment

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.480
be at real estate or business I got smarter

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.880
because experience makes you smarter

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.940
so I started with just a little $18,000 unit

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.590
I broke up my credit card

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.340
I paid the $2,000 down payment with my credit
card

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.150
so the 100% financed

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.650
now most experts will tell you

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.630
that's stupid you don't do that but uh

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.710
but if you know what you're doing you can
do it

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:14.900
a number of years ago I bought a 7 million
dollar

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.279
commercial building I paid for it with zero
down

00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:20.960
and every month after everything is paid for

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.990
it puts about $30,000

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:24.980
a month income in my pocket

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.580
or three hundred sixty thousand dollars a
year

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.250
for no money down

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:34.110
so there is the price of having a good education
or a bad education

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:35.530
A good education is knowing

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:37.730
the good debt versus bad debt

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.180
and how debtors can win

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.380
if you know what you're doing

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.730
one of the things you say is that the poor
pay their bills first

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.440
the rich pay themselves first

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.890
that's a tough that's a really tough one

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.440
but it makes people kind of crazy

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.440
Yeah

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.040
because the owner from richest man Babylon
says pay yourself first

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.040
but what most people do is

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.110
they pay the bills first and they never pay
themselves anything

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:00.860
and that's a discipline I had to get into

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.650
was I always pay myself first

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:04.260
even when I had no money

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.770
and would have all these bill collectors

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.050
calling me I use them as inspiration

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:09.240
you know what I mean

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.240
Really?

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.240
oh when they're how the government's hounding
you

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.240
bill collectors calling

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.240
because I've been broke

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.730
so I can understand what it feels like to
be broke

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.190
when those guys are calling you instead

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:20.980
of you know shrinking and going into the shell
and eating my pizza

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.940
I use it as motivation to go out

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:23.990
and make more money

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:27.170
so I used it I used my bill collectors as
motivation

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:28.750
and that's why I paid myself first

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:29.900
even though sometimes I

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.370
What would you pay yourself?

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.310
I was bought assets, I'd buy a house

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.440
or I'd put money in the bank

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.020
of things like this but it was just a habit

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.940
Exactly what's you're talking about

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.940
It's up here

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.940
it's about changing the way you think, that
was the whole book is about

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.000
that's it, because because we're our biggest
asset

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.690
We're also a biggest liability

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:46.690
We are..

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:47.690
Yeah, we are..

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:51.080
I know, i read that

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.380
So if you're gonna say work hard

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.620
most people are working hard for earned income

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.560
and that's what these guys are working for

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.710
the trouble with earned income in America

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.529
your tax rates approximately fifty percent

00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:03.730
or as Warren Buffett says

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.150
it's a shame that his secretary

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.779
pays a higher percentage in taxes

00:11:07.779 --> 00:11:10.470
and he did although he makes billions of dollars

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.610
So when you say to a child

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.210
go to school and get a safe secure job

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:14.630
you're telling them work for earned income

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.339
the worst type of income

00:11:16.339 --> 00:11:21.890
the second type of income is portfolio income

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.830
and today as I speak and they're trying to
change this

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.130
It's about 20 percent

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.060
and portfolio income is generally known as
capital gains

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.190
So if I buy a stock for ten dollars

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.820
and I sell it for 50 dollars

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.510
the forty dollar gain is taxed at 20%

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:37.640
or if I buy a house for a hundred thousand

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.110
I sell it for two hundred thousand

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.520
that's a capital gains type event

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.210
so you pay a lot of tax for that

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:45.610
and the third type of income which is the

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.740
which is the best type of income

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:53.320
Excuse me I can't spell again is passive income

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.490
and this is income that just comes in on a
regular basis

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:58.770
One of the reasons I am wealthy

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.100
and is able to retire at a young age

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.220
is because I worked hard for passive income

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.830
not earned income

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.630
I don't flip real estate generally

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:08.740
not portfolio income

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.220
I don't flip stocks

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.110
I want passive income

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:14.380
so today the new rules of money

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.970
is important to understand

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.490
what are you going to school to become "E"
- "S"

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:20.880
Entrepreneur or Investor

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.850
and what kind of income you're working hard
for earned, portfolio or passive

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:26.940
and if you know what you're doing

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:31.839
you can pay zero pratence percent taxes legally

00:12:31.839 --> 00:12:32.839
and this can be done

00:12:32.839 --> 00:12:33.839
all over the world

00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:34.839
kept saying

00:12:34.839 --> 00:12:35.839
We can't do it in my country

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:36.839
Well..

00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:37.990
These people can't do it in any country

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.050
but in most parts of the world

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.770
governments need these people

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.940
so they're always giving tax incentives for

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.810
for investors and business owners who are
for passive income

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.710
So those are some of the new rules of money

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:51.040
You've really got to know

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.029
what you're working hard at

00:12:53.029 --> 00:12:54.690
and what kind of work are you performing

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.000
what kind of income are you working hard for

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.100
