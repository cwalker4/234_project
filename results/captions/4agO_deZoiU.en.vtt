00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.830
- We build tiny homes
because we like doing things

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.530
that people tell us can't be done.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.420
Welcome to Tiny Ten.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.620
- Turning what used to be a parking lot

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.130
into ten tiny homes
has been truly amazing.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.940
My new tiny house,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.730
it fits me and the dogs perfectly.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.430
- [Narrator] Reno, Nevada.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.730
Known as the biggest
little city in the world,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.550
is living up to it's reputation

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.470
with a new tiny home development

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.270
that's big on design but
leaves a small footprint.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.340
This is Tiny Ten.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.440
A planned community of ten
energy efficient houses.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.450
Each one measures around 650 square feet.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.730
And has two floors.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.670
They're designed to be compact

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.930
without sacrificing creature
comforts you'd expect

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.500
to find in a full sized house.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.190
Each comes with a washer
and dryer, air conditioner,

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:02.280
a kitchen with slick appliances,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.060
a private back yard, and a garage.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.150
- We classified these as
kind of like a glove house.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.090
It fits just right.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.020
It's not too big, not too little.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.260
We feel like our tiny houses

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.960
are more livable in the long term.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.800
- [Narrator] Local developers Pam Haberman

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.950
and Kelly Rae are behind the project.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.000
Both were early adopters of
the tiny living philosophy.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.620
- The tiny home phenomenon,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.680
we started thinking about it
probably about 20 years ago.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.220
- [Narrator] In fact, their last home

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.290
was a compact 400 square feet,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.250
which allowed them to live affordably

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.900
after the 2007 housing market crash.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.940
- [Kelly] We lost pretty
much darn near everything.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.840
We moved into a small
comfortable place to call home.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.673
- [Narrator] Ever since,

00:01:41.673 --> 00:01:44.130
they've taken on various
tiny home projects.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.980
Tiny Ten is, by far, their most ambitious.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.310
- This is very modern, very upscale,

00:01:52.797 --> 00:01:54.590
just in miniature form.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.910
I've had the vision for 11 years.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.890
For people that want to down size,

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.330
or that want to simplify.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.110
- [Narrator] That was the reason

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.880
for 32 year old Kevin Greenawalt.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.740
One of the first residents
to move into Tiny Ten.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.210
- I had previously owned
a 1600 square foot home.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.240
It was a three bed, two and a half bath,

00:02:13.451 --> 00:02:15.090
just way too big.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.840
So I realized very quickly
that I needed less space

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.440
and something that was a
lot more manageable for me.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.970
- [Narrator] His current
house spans two floors.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.060
Has two bedrooms, and a bathroom.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.080
- My new tiny house is
about 450 square feet

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.650
on the first floor.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.700
Logan loves the stairs.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.290
And then the loft is
another 200 square feet.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.900
Kind of a multi purpose room.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.810
A spare bedroom, if family
or friends come to stay.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.280
And also an office.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.953
Drop it.

00:02:44.525 --> 00:02:46.070
And the downstairs space I want it to be

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.290
kind of the common area
where I have my entertainment

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.200
center down here.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.420
And there is a really quick
access to the backyard

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.440
for the dogs.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.190
All the houses are kind of
facing this communal area.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.990
So it's very welcoming, very
inviting for the neighbors.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.050
- [Narrator] Karen Prudy,

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.880
who moved two doors down from Kevin,

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.720
also came here to downsize.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:07.980
And to save money.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.070
As a recent retiree
and active grandmother,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.620
affordable housing is critical

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.270
for maintaining her tight budget.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.410
Karen bought this house
for about $220,000.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.430
That's nearly half the cost of
an average new home in Reno.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.210
Which typically runs $450,000.

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.410
- It's just horrendous what
you have to pay per month.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.660
At these houses your
mortgage would be cheaper

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.700
than what they're paying for for rent.

00:03:35.788 --> 00:03:37.690
Now, in my 60's, I
started looking at coming

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.410
more into downtown Reno.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.330
And these were just opening up

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.950
and that was like have
that's exactly what I want.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.280
- Tiny Ten is perfect
for the person who enjoys

00:03:50.588 --> 00:03:53.190
proximity to their neighbors.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.030
Who loves a downtown or urban environment.

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:02.810
Who cares about their footprint.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.390
- [Narrator] Locating Tiny Ten
in the heart of downtown Reno

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.900
was essential to the project's success.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.440
The development is
considered urban infill,

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.580
which is city planning speak
for recycling unused land.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.840
- For every acre that you
develop in an infill setting,

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.460
four acres of open space are preserved.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.090
We don't like to see the
mountain tops scraped off

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.670
and sprawl.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.630
And what that means is, you know,

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.230
stay in the urban center,
and leave nature as nature.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.810
- [Narrator] While one
development can't turn

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.180
an entire city around,

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.040
the philosophy it
embodies might be able to.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.600
And in the meantime,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.500
the community's residents are
feeling an immediate impact.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.420
- I love that I'm retired.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.470
I get to be at home.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.570
But there's gonna be a lot of young people

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.750
I think it's just gonna be awesome.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.020
- The fact that I know
my neighbors so well.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.250
It's amazing.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.230
This place definitely feels like home.
