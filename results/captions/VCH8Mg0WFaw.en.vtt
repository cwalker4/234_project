The more results we get
from Tuesday's elections,

00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:19.986

that this was a blue wave

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:22.989

of Trump's presidency.

net gain in the House

that's what happened yesterday

Trump's performance yesterday
was deeply revealing

sees himself as above the law.

how he can't pass tax cuts

to waste time

the votes in the Senate.

It doesn't get passed.

Now, one feature
of our Constitutional system

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:04.616
is that Congress
gets to constrain

the power of the president
and investigate him.

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:08.587

that they would use that power

from the public

00:08:18.997 --> 00:08:20.799
-Jeff Sessions was fired.

00:08:20.799 --> 00:08:23.135
He wrote a letter today saying

00:08:23.135 --> 00:08:26.671
that he was resigning at
the request of the President.

00:08:26.671 --> 00:08:28.774
-The President,
who became famous

00:08:28.774 --> 00:08:30.275
for the phrase "You're Fired,"

00:08:30.275 --> 00:08:33.779
punting to his chief of staff
to give Sessions the boot.

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:35.748
John Kelly didn't even
do it face-to-face,

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:38.250
but opted to fire Sessions
by phone.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.785
-These guys are such cowards.

00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:41.821
Trump didn't want
to fire Sessions himself,

00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:44.122
so he had Kelly do it, and Kelly
didn't want to do it, either,

00:08:44.122 --> 00:08:45.725
so he just called him.

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:47.726
I'm surprised they didn't
just send Stephen Miller

00:08:47.726 --> 00:08:49.594
to perch on Sessions'
window sill.

00:08:49.594 --> 00:08:52.198
"Caw! You're fired! Caw!"

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:53.866
[ Laughter ]

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:56.168
With Democrats regaining power
in Washington,

00:08:56.168 --> 00:08:58.704
Trump is now seriously
threatened for the first
time in his presidency,

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:00.639
and in response,
he's becoming more lawless.

00:09:00.639 --> 00:09:03.242
He sees the law not as
a constraint on his power,

00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:05.077
but as a tool
to protect himself.

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:06.778
And as Jeff Sessions
just learned,

00:09:06.778 --> 00:09:08.180
he'll attack anyone in his way,

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.115
whether you're an opponent
who hates him

00:09:10.115 --> 00:09:11.784
or a supporter who gives him...

00:09:11.784 --> 00:09:13.151
-The embrace.

00:09:13.151 --> 00:09:15.855
-This has been "A Closer Look."
