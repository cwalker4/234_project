00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.800
Tonight, I'd like to
tell you about one

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.500
of the big questions in science.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.420
It's a question that
goes back at least two

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.350
and a half thousand years,
to the ancient Greeks.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.900
And it's a question that has
been discussed in this room

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.080
many, many times over
the past 200 years,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.550
but it's an important question.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.220
And I think it's important
that we revisit it.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.770
And the question is simply this.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.330
It's, what are we made of?

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.540
What are the fundamental
building blocks of nature

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.320
that you and me and everything
else in the universe

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.030
are constructed from?

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.600
That's the story I'd
like to tell you.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.620
So what I'd like to do is
try and give you an overview

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.425
of our current understanding.

00:00:52.425 --> 00:00:53.800
I'd also like to
try and give you

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.175
an overview of where we hope
to go in the future, of what

00:00:56.175 --> 00:00:59.050
progress we can we can hope
to make in the next few years

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.600
and few decades.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.100
And we're going to cover quite
a lot of ground in this talk.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.164
I should warn you now,
not least because I'm

00:01:05.164 --> 00:01:07.330
going to discuss every
single thing in the universe,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.110
quite literally.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.990
We're going to talk,
amongst other things,

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.620
about what's happening at the
world's most powerful particle

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.580
collider.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.850
This is a machine that's called
the Large Hadron Collider,

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.230
or the LHC for short.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.930
It'll come up a
lot in this talk.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.030
And it's a machine which
is based underground

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.420
in a place called CERN which
is just outside Geneva.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.700
We'll also talk
about experiments

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.114
in the last few years that
look backwards in time

00:01:34.114 --> 00:01:35.530
towards the Big
Bang, that give us

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.140
some understanding
about what was happening

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.940
in the first few
fractions of a second

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.130
after time itself
started to exist.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.450
And on top of all
this, I also want

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.260
to give you some idea about
the theoretical abstract ideas,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.950
and even a little bit of an
idea about the mathematics that

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.491
underlies our current
understanding of the universe.

00:01:57.491 --> 00:01:58.990
Because I'm a
theoretical physicist.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.800
What I do is study the
equations, try to understand

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.705
the equations, that govern
the world we live in.

00:02:06.705 --> 00:02:08.830
And so, I'd just like to
give you a flavour of what

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.657
that's about.

00:02:09.657 --> 00:02:11.240
At some point-- I
should warn you now.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.440
At some point, I'm even going
to show you an equation.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.650
You know, you can get
sent on training courses

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.247
for this kind of thing.

00:02:19.247 --> 00:02:20.330
There's a number one rule.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.600
The number one rule is never
show them any equations.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.049
If you show them equations,
you'll just terrify them.

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.590
At some point in
this lecture, you're

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.550
all going to be terrified,
so just prepare yourselves.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.080
OK?

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.580
OK.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.481
You know, there's a traditional
way to start talks like this.

00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:38.230
The traditional way
is to be very cultured

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.870
and talk about what
Democritus and Lucretius said

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.570
two and a half thousand
years ago and the ideas

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.574
that the ancient
Greeks had about atoms.

00:02:46.574 --> 00:02:48.490
But you know, I don't
want to start like this.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.350
We've made a lot of progress in
two and a half thousand years,

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.650
and you know, there's
just better places

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.920
to kick off a science talk.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.660
So the first modern
picture that we

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.160
had of what the universe is made
of, everything we're made of,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.150
is this.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.260
So I hope this is familiar
to most people here.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.540
This is the periodic
table of elements.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.040
OK?

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.490
It's one of the most iconic
images in all of science.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.870
What we have here are
120-ish different elements.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.150
I should point out, no
less than 10 of which

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.490
were discovered in this very
building, and which constitute,

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.600
or at least in the
1800s were thought

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.899
to constitute everything
that existed in nature.

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:36.940
So it's certainly true
that any material you get,

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.309
you can distill it down
into its component parts,

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:41.350
and you'll find that all
of those component parts

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.190
are made of one of
these 120 elements.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.930
So it's a great
moment in science.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.680
It's really one of the
triumphs of science.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.100
It's also, I should add,
the reason that I stopped

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.100
doing chemistry in school.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.720
Because if you're a chemist,
this is basically as good

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.200
as it gets.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.390
You know, if we're honest,
it's kind of a mess.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.160
Everything in the
universe is classified

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.690
into things on the
left that go bang

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.300
if you put them in water through
things on the right which,

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.176
really if we're honest,
don't do very much at all.

00:04:16.176 --> 00:04:18.550
You kind of organise everything
into these stupid shapes.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.290
And it looks a little
bit like Australia.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.480
There's a big dip in the
top, and then there's

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.130
these two strips of
elements that you

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.390
have to put along the
bottom, because there's

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.670
no room for them in the
middle where they belong.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.310
You know, I don't
know about you,

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.780
if I was asked to come up with
a fundamental classification

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.160
of everything in
the universe, this

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.570
isn't what I would
have gone for.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.436
Are there any chemists
in the audience?

00:04:39.436 --> 00:04:41.260
[LAUGHING]

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.040
I'm sorry for you.

00:04:44.541 --> 00:04:45.040
OK.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.890
But you know, I'm
not alone in this.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.390
It's not just me that
thinks this is a silly way

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.380
to organise nature.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.920
Nature itself thinks this is a
silly way to organise nature.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.580
Of course, we know this
isn't the fundamental-- this

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.710
isn't the end of the story.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.250
This isn't the fundamental
building blocks.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.940
And the first person to realise
there's that there's something

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.340
deeper than this was a Cambridge
physicist called JJ Thomson.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.530
So at the end of the
1800s, JJ Thomson

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.640
discovered a particle that
was smaller than an atom

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.050
that we now call the electron.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.740
And in 1897, he announced
this in this room-- in fact,

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.470
in this very lecture series--

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.902
to a stunned
audience, an audience

00:05:25.902 --> 00:05:27.610
that was so stunned
at least half of them

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.310
didn't believe
what he was saying.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.060
There was one very
distinguished scientist

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.601
who afterwards told JJ Thomson
he thought the whole thing was

00:05:33.601 --> 00:05:37.870
a hoax, that JJ Thomson had
just been pulling their leg.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.480
But of course, it's not a hoax.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.060
This isn't the fundamental
elements of nature.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.460
And within 15 years of
JJ Thomson's discovery,

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.940
his successor in Cambridge, a
man called Ernest Rutherford,

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.960
had figured out exactly what
these atoms are made of.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.830
And this is the picture that
Rutherford came up with.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.140
So we now know that
each of these elements

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.270
consists of a nucleus,
which is tiny.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.450
The metaphor that Rutherford
himself used was it's like

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.030
a fly in the centre
of the cathedral.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.140
And then orbiting this
nucleus in, I should add,

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.350
fairly blurry orbits,
are the electrons,

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.890
which sort of fill out very
sparsely the rest of the space.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.180
So that's a picture
of these atoms.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.890
Subsequently, we learned
that the nucleus is not

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:33.910
itself fundamental.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.400
The nucleus contains
smaller particles.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.100
They're particles that we
call protons and neutrons.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:44.410
And in the 1970s, we learned
that the protons and neutrons

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.070
aren't fundamental either.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.200
So in the 1970s, we learned that
inside each proton and neutron

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.550
are three smaller particles
that we call quarks.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.590
There are two different
kinds of quarks.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.870
By the 1970s, I'm
guessing physicists

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.610
didn't have a classical
Greek education,

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.580
and had kind of run
out of classy names.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:08.870
So we call these quarks the
up quark and the down quark.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:09.370
OK?

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.235
For no good reason.

00:07:10.235 --> 00:07:12.610
It's not like the up quark is
higher than the down quark.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:13.550
It's not like it points up.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.674
Just no good reason at all.

00:07:14.674 --> 00:07:16.240
The up quark and the down quark.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.920
So the proton consists of two
up quarks and a down quark.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.780
And the neutron consists of two
down quarks and an up quark.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.120
This, as far as we know, are
the fundamental building blocks

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.160
of nature.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.830
We've never discovered anything
smaller than the electron,

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.370
and we've never discovered
anything smaller

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.660
than the quarks.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.940
So we have three particles
of which everything we know

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.440
is made.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.850
And it's worth stressing,
that's kind of astonishing.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:49.639
You know?

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:50.930
We sort of take it for granted.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:51.930
We learn this in school.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.800
We don't really think
about it deeply.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.050
Everything we see in the
world, all the diversity

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.380
in the natural world, you,
me, everything around us,

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:03.820
just the same three
particles with slightly

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.180
different rearrangements
repeated over and over

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.740
and over again.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.550
It's an amazing lesson
to draw about how

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.040
the world is put together.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.270
So that's what we have.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.510
We have an electron
and two quarks.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:24.040
And you know, these aren't the
fundamental building blocks

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.570
that the Greeks
had thought about,

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.945
and they're certainly not the
fundamental building blocks

00:08:27.945 --> 00:08:29.920
that the Victorians
had thought about.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.120
But you know, the spirit of the
issue really hasn't changed.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.789
The spirit is exactly
what Democritus

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:42.970
said 2,500 years ago, that
they're like LEGO bricks

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.610
from which everything in
the world is constructed.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.220
These LEGO bricks are
particles, and the particles

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.669
are the electron and two quarks.

00:08:50.669 --> 00:08:51.710
It's a very nice picture.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.020
It's a very comforting picture.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.790
It's the picture we
teach kids at school.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.340
It's the picture we
even teach students

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.770
in undergraduate university.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:03.050
And there's a problem with it.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:06.460
The problem is it's a lie.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.940
It's a white lie.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.730
It's a white lie that
we tell our children

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:12.280
because we don't
want to expose them

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.820
to the difficult and horrible
truth too early on it.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.570
It makes it easier to
learn if you believe

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.060
that these particles are
the fundamental building

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.270
blocks of the universe.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.460
But it's simply not true.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.030
The best theories that
we have of physics

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:29.340
do not have underlying them
the quark particle and the two

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.100
quark particle-- sorry, the
electron particle and the two

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.050
quark particles.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:38.140
In fact, the very best
theories we have of physics

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.790
don't rely on particles at all.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.310
The best theories
we have tell us

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.800
that the fundamental
building blocks of nature

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.080
are not particles, but
something much more

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.390
nebulous and abstract.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.820
The fundamental building
blocks of nature

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.740
are fluid-like
substances which are

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.840
spread throughout
the entire universe

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.520
and ripple in strange
and interesting ways.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.110
That's the fundamental
reality in which we live.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:13.020
These fluid-like substances
we have a name for.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.040
We call them fields.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.934
So this is a picture of a field.

00:10:22.934 --> 00:10:25.350
This isn't the kind of field
that physicists have in mind.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.890
You know, this is what you think
a field is if you're a farmer

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.410
or if you're a normal person.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:35.070
If you're a physicist, you
have a very different picture

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.530
in your mind when you
think about fields.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:41.096
And I'll tell you the general
definition of a field,

00:10:41.096 --> 00:10:42.720
and then we'll go
through some examples

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.510
so that you get
familiar with this.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.802
The physicist's definition
of a field is the following.

00:10:47.802 --> 00:10:49.968
It's something that, as I
said, is spread everywhere

00:10:49.968 --> 00:10:51.180
throughout the universe.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.760
It's something that
takes a particular value

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.710
at every point in space.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:59.820
And what's more, that
value can change in time.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.380
So a good picture
to have your mind

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:07.440
is fluid, which ripples and
sways throughout the universe.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.170
Now, it's not a new idea.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.430
It's not an idea that
we've just come up with.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:16.920
It's an idea which dates
back almost 200 years.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.930
And like so many other
things in science,

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:23.700
it's an idea which
originated in this very room.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.700
Because as I'm sure
many of you are aware,

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.520
this is the home
of Michael Faraday.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.840
And Michael Faraday initiated
this lecture series in 1825.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.220
He gave over a hundred of these
Friday evening discourses,

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.720
and the vast majority of these
were on his own discoveries

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.280
on the experiments he did on
electricity and magnetism.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.720
So he did many, many things
in electricity and magnetism

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.490
over many decades.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.040
And in doing, so he
built up an intuition

00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.480
for how electric and
magnetic phenomena work.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.370
And the intuition
is what we now call

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.860
the electric and magnetic field.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.940
So what he envisaged was
that threaded everywhere

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.840
throughout space were these
invisible objects called

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.630
the electric and
magnetic fields.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:16.970
Now, we learned this in school.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.720
Again, it's something
that we sort of take

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.060
for granted because we
learned it at an early age,

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.990
and we don't sort of appreciate
just how big of a radical step

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.480
this idea of Faraday's is.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.240
I want to stress, it's one
of the most revolutionary

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.820
abstract ideas in the
history of science,

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.160
that these electric and
magnetic fields exist.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.526
So let me just--

00:12:37.526 --> 00:12:39.400
you're supposed to be
demonstrations in this.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.970
I'm not just a
theoretical physicist.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.400
I'm a very
theoretical physicist.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.920
It's very hard for me to do
any kind of experiment that's

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:47.503
going to work.

00:12:47.503 --> 00:12:51.750
But I'm just going to show you
something that you've all seen.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:52.830
They're magnets.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:53.330
OK?

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.170
And we all played these
games when we were kids

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.253
or when we were in school.

00:12:56.253 --> 00:12:58.930
You take these magnets,
and you move them together.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.750
And as they get
closer and closer,

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.300
there's this force that
you can sort of just

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:08.130
feel building up that pushes,
the pressure that pushes

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:09.930
against these two magnets.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.850
And it doesn't matter
how often you do it,

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.450
and it doesn't matter how many
degrees you have in physics.

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:16.270
It's just a little bit magical.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:17.390
You know?

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:18.580
And you all know this.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:22.600
There's something just special
about this weird feeling

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.170
that you get between magnets.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.180
And this was Faraday's genius.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:31.080
It was to appreciate that even
though you can't see anything

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.630
in between, even though no
matter how closely you look,

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.540
the space between these
magnets will seem to be empty,

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.730
he said nonetheless, there's
something real there.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:43.260
There's something real and
physical, which is invisible,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.360
but he's building
up, and that's what's

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.040
responsible for the force.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.900
So he called them
lines of force.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.400
We now call it the
magnetic field.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.520
So this, of course, is a
picture of Michael Faraday.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:01.560
This is a picture of
Michael Faraday lecturing

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.610
behind this very table.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:06.785
Here is a drawing from one
of Michael Faraday's papers.

00:14:06.785 --> 00:14:08.160
It was pointed
out to me earlier.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.250
When you leave, there's
a carpet just here.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.260
The carpet has this
pattern, this picture

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.730
just repeated on it over
and over and over again.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:21.120
And on the bottom here is one
of Michael Faraday's most famous

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.040
demonstrations that he did here.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.940
So I'll just walk you
through what Faraday did.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:34.540
The thing on the right, there's
a small coil with a hand on it.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.980
This is a battery, and the
battery passes a current

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.330
around this coil.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.790
And in doing so,
there's a magnetic field

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.320
that's induced in this.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.940
It's what's called a solenoid.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.000
And then Faraday did
the following thing.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.750
He simply moved this small
coil A through this big coil B

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:53.730
like this.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.690
And something
miraculous happened.

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:59.260
When you do that, there's
a moving magnetic field.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.170
Faraday's great
discovery was induction.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.540
It gives rise to a
current in B, which

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.730
then over on this
end of the table,

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.750
makes a needle
flicker like this.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.770
So extremely simple.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:13.810
You move a magnetic
field, and it gives rise

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.790
to a current, which
makes a needle flicker

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.980
on the other side of the table.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:22.870
This astounded
audiences in the 1800s.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:25.930
Because you were doing something
and affecting the needle

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.030
on the other end of the
table, yet you never

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:29.620
touched the needle.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.060
It was amazing.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.390
You could make something move
without ever going near it,

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:35.959
without ever touching it.

00:15:35.959 --> 00:15:37.250
We're kind of jaded these days.

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.260
You can do the same experiment.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:39.130
You can pick up your cell phone.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:40.180
You can press a few buttons.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.763
You can call somebody
on the other end

00:15:41.763 --> 00:15:43.930
of the earth within seconds.

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.490
But it's the same principle.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.980
But this was the first
time it was demonstrated

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.630
that the field is real.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.820
You can communicate
using the field.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.910
You can affect things
far away using the field

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:58.060
without ever touching it.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.560
So this is Michael
Faraday's legacy.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.530
There's not just
particles in the world.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:05.740
There's other objects that
are slightly more subtle that

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:11.230
are called fields that are
spread throughout all of space.

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.800
By the way, if you ever
want to really appreciate

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:20.085
the genius of Michael Faraday,
he gave this lecture in 1846.

00:16:20.085 --> 00:16:22.169
He gave many lectures in 1846.

00:16:22.169 --> 00:16:23.710
But there was one
in particular where

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.480
he finished 20 minutes early.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.700
He ran out of
things to say, so he

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.480
engaged in some idle
speculation for 20 minutes.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:37.690
And Faraday suggested that
these invisible, electric,

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:40.420
and magnetic fields
that he'd postulated

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:45.080
were quite literally the
only thing we've ever seen.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.750
He suggested that
it's ripples of

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:50.500
the electric and magnetic field,
which is what we call light.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.620
So it took a course 50 years for
people like Maxwell and Hertz

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.890
to confirm that this is
indeed what light is made of,

00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:00.300
but it was Faraday's genius
that appreciated this,

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.800
that there were waves in
the electric magnetic field,

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.980
and those waves are the
light that we see around us.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:07.480
OK.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.220
So this is Faraday's legacy.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:14.859
But it turns out this idea of
fields was much more important

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:17.140
than Faraday had realised.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.930
And it took over
150 years for us

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:24.250
to appreciate the
importance of these fields.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.290
So what happened
in these 150 years

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:28.930
was that there was a small
revolution in science.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:33.380
In the 1920s, we realised
that the world is very,

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:38.740
very different from the
common sense ideas that Newton

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.050
and Galileo had handed down
to us centuries before.

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:45.400
So in the 1920s, people like
Heisenberg and Schrodinger

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.670
realised that on
the smallest scales,

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.300
on the microscopic scales, the
world is much more mysterious

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:56.440
and counter-intuitive than we
ever really imagined it could

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.190
be.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.020
This, of course, is
the theory that we now

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.450
know as quantum mechanics.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:05.620
So there's a lot I could
say about quantum mechanics.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:09.610
Let me tell you one of the
punch lines of quantum mechanics

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:15.790
one of the punch lines is
that energy isn't continuous.

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:18.460
Energy in the world
is always parcelled up

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.340
into some little discrete lump.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.350
That's actually what
the word quantum means.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:27.280
Quantum means
discrete or a lump.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.700
So the real fun starts
when you try and take

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.070
the ideas of quantum
mechanics, which

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.770
say that things
should be discrete,

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:40.660
and you try to combine them
with Faraday's ideas of fields,

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.080
which are very much continuous,
smooth objects, which

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.890
are waving and
oscillating in space.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:52.330
So the idea of trying to combine
these two theories together

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.900
is what we call
quantum field theory.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:58.769
And here's the implication
of quantum field theory.

00:18:58.769 --> 00:19:00.310
The first implication
is what happens

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:02.380
for the electric
and magnetic field.

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:05.620
So Faraday taught us,
and Maxwell later,

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.140
that waves of the
electromagnetic field

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.120
are what we call light.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.330
But when you apply
quantum mechanics to this,

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.670
you find that these
light waves aren't

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:18.760
quite as smooth and
continuous as they appeared.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.100
So if you look closely
at light waves,

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.870
you'll find that they're
made of particles.

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:25.490
They're little
particles of light,

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.490
and these are particles
that we call the photon.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:35.650
The magic of this idea is
that that same principle

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:40.250
applies to every single other
particle in the universe.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:45.490
So there is spread everywhere
throughout this room something

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:48.400
that we call the electron field.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.640
It's like a fluid that fills
this room and, in fact,

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.100
fills the entire universe.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.320
And the ripples of
this electron fluid,

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.320
the ripples of the
waves of this fluid,

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.230
get tied into little
bundles of energy

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:04.450
by the rules of
quantum mechanics,

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:08.200
and those bundles of energy
are what we call the particle,

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.290
the electron.

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:14.140
All the electrons that are in
your body are not fundamental.

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:16.510
All the electrons that
exist in your body

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:19.330
are waves of the same
underlying field.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:21.660
And we're all connected
to each other.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.400
Just like the waves
on the ocean all

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.100
belong to the same
underlying ocean,

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.040
the electrons in your body
are ripples of the same field

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.280
as the electrons in my body.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.340
There's more than this.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.540
There's also in this
room two quark fields.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.340
And the ripples of
these two quark fields

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:43.870
give rise to what we call the
up quark and the down quark.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:45.730
And the same is true
for every other kind

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:48.040
of particle in the universe.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.700
There are fields that
underlie everything.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.350
And what we think of as
particles aren't really

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:57.940
particles at all, they're
waves of these fields tied up

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.510
into little bundles of energy.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.310
This is the legacy of Faraday.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.760
This is where Faraday's
vision of fields has taken us.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.130
There are no particles
in the world.

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:13.210
The basic fundamental building
blocks of our universe

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:17.125
are these fluid-like
substances that we call fields.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:21.390
All right.

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:27.270
OK.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:29.520
So what I want to do in
the rest of this talk

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.470
is tell you where
that vision takes us.

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.590
I want to tell you about
what it means that we're not

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:38.850
made of particles.

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:40.230
We're made of fields.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.300
And I want to tell you
what we can do with that,

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.181
and how we can best understand
the universe around us.

00:21:46.181 --> 00:21:46.680
OK?

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.720
So here's the first thing.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.440
Take a box and take
every single thing

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.127
that exists out of that box.

00:21:54.127 --> 00:21:55.710
Take all the particles
out of the box,

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.540
all the atoms out of the box.

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.210
What you're left with
is a pure vacuum.

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:04.180
And this is what the
vacuum looks like.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:08.490
So what you're looking at
here is a computer simulation

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.800
using our best theory
of physics of something

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.830
called the standard model,
which I'll introduced later.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:19.200
But it's a computer simulation
of absolutely nothing.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.350
This is empty space.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:24.750
Literally empty space
with nothing in it.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.730
This is the simplest
thing you could possibly

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:29.220
imagine in the universe.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.040
And you can see, it's an
interesting place to be,

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.060
an empty space.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.380
It's not dull and boring.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.620
What you're looking at
here is that even when

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:41.400
the particles are taken
out, the field still exists.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.020
The field is there.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.240
But what's more, the field
is governed by the rules

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.220
of quantum mechanics.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.950
And there's a principle in
quantum mechanics, which

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:52.330
is called the Heisenberg
Uncertainty Principle, which

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.740
says you're not
allowed to sit still.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.714
And the field has to obey this.

00:22:56.714 --> 00:22:58.380
So even when there's
nothing else there,

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.190
the field is constantly
bubbling and fluctuating

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:06.300
in what's, quite honestly,
a very complicated way.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.900
These are things that we call
quantum vacuum fluctuations.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.270
But this is what
nothingness looks

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:17.250
like from the perspective of
our current theories of physics.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:19.990
It's worth saying that this
is a computer simulation.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:21.750
It looks a little
bit like a cartoon,

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.360
but it's actually quite a
powerful computer simulation,

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.780
and it took a long time to do.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.460
But these aren't
just theoretical.

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:32.160
These quantum fluctuations that
are there in the pure vacuum

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.790
are things that we can measure.

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:36.240
There's something called
the Casimir force.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:40.000
The Casimir force is a force
between two metal plates

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.670
that get pushed
together basically

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:44.280
because there's more of
this stuff on the outside

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.780
than on the inside.

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.269
And you know, these are real.

00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:48.810
These are things
that we can measure,

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:51.330
and they behave just
as we would predict

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:53.670
they would from our theories.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:56.700
So this is nothing.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:03.480
And this brings me to the more
mathematical side of the talk.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.870
Because there's a
challenge in this.

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:08.910
This is the simplest
thing we can

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:13.140
imagine in the entire
universe, and it's complicated.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.600
It's astonishingly complicated.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.055
It doesn't get easier than this.

00:24:18.055 --> 00:24:19.680
You know, if you want
to now understand

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.060
not nothing but a
single particle,

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.210
well, that's much more
complicated than this.

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:26.576
And if you want to understand
10 to the 23 particles

00:24:26.576 --> 00:24:28.200
all doing something
interesting, that's

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.910
really, really much more
complicated than this.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:32.760
So there's a problem in--

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.910
it's my problem, not yours--

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:41.200
in addressing this fundamental
description of the universe,

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.890
which is that it's just hard.

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:46.680
The mathematics that we use
to describe quantum fields,

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.150
to describe
everything that we're

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:50.310
made of in terms
of quantum fields,

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:52.470
is substantially more
difficult than the maths

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:55.890
that arises in any other
area of physics or science.

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:57.690
It's genuinely difficult.

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:00.390
I can put this in
some perspective.

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:06.014
There's a list of six open
problems in mathematics.

00:25:06.014 --> 00:25:07.680
They're considered
to be the six hardest

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.210
problems in mathematics.

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:11.380
There used to be seven,
but some crazy Russian guy

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.270
solved one of them.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:15.000
So there's six left.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.580
You win a million
bucks if you can solve

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:20.220
any one of these problems.

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:21.960
If you know a little
bit of mathematics,

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:25.160
they're things like the Riemann
hypothesis, or P versus MP.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.960
They're sort of famously
difficult problems.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.660
This is one of
those six problems.

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:34.200
You win a million dollars
if you can understand this.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.190
So what does it mean?

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:37.110
It doesn't mean can you
build a big computer

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:39.750
and just demonstrate
that these are there.

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:42.540
It means can you understand
from first principles

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.270
by solving the equations
the patterns that

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:49.950
emerge within these
quantum fluctuations?

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:51.810
It's an extraordinarily
difficult problem.

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:54.187
You know, it's writing
the kind of thing I do.

00:25:54.187 --> 00:25:56.520
I don't know a single person
in the world who's actually

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.034
working on this problem.

00:25:58.034 --> 00:25:58.950
That's how hard it is.

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:01.860
We don't really even
know how to begin

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:07.260
to start understanding these
kind of ideas in quantum field

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.300
theory.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.570
OK.

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:13.890
This theme about the
mathematics being challenging

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:18.790
is something which is going to
come back later in the talk.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:21.480
So I'd like just to take a
little bit of a diversion

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:25.690
for a few minutes and give
you a sense about what

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.160
we can do
mathematically and what

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.326
we can't do mathematically,
just to sort of tell you

00:26:29.326 --> 00:26:32.470
what the state of play is
in terms of understanding

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:35.110
these theories called
quantum field theories which

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:36.820
underlie our universe.

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:41.230
So there are times
where we understand

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:45.940
extremely well what's going
on with quantum fields.

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:49.900
And that happens basically
when these fluctuations

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.450
are very calm and tame, when
they're not wild and strong.

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:54.490
These ones are big.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:56.440
But when they're
much more calmer,

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.600
when the vacuum is much
more like a mill pond

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.290
than it is like a raging
storm, in those cases,

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:05.020
we really think we
understand what we're doing.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:09.810
And to illustrate this, I just
want to give you this example.

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:15.130
So this number g is
a particular property

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:17.290
of the electron particle.

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:19.327
And I'll quickly
explain what it is.

00:27:19.327 --> 00:27:21.160
The electron is a
particle, and it turns out

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.750
the electron spins.

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:25.900
It orbits rather like
the earth orbits.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.910
And it has an axis of spin.

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:31.600
And you can change
the axis of that spin.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.330
And the way you change it
is you take a magnetic field

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:35.500
like this.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.660
And in the presence
of a magnetic field,

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.160
the electron will spin.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.590
The electron will stay
in one place, but spin.

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:46.260
And then the axis of spin
will slowly rotate like this.

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.130
It's what's called procession.

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:51.600
And the speed at which the
axis of that spin processes

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.100
is dictated by this number here.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:55.810
OK?

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:59.860
So it's not the most important
thing in the big picture.

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:02.140
However, historically,
this has been extremely

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.440
important in the history of
physics, because it turns out,

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.620
this is a number you can
measure very, very accurately

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.090
doing experiments.

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:12.430
And so this number
has sort of acted

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:17.080
as a testing ground for us
to see how well we understand

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.180
the theories that
underlie nature,

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.152
and in particular,
quantum field theory.

00:28:21.152 --> 00:28:23.110
So let me tell you what
you're looking at here.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:29.350
The first number is the
result of many, many decades

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:36.022
of painstaking experiments
measuring very, very precisely

00:28:36.022 --> 00:28:37.230
this feature of the electron.

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:40.630
It's called the magnetic
moment, for what it's worth.

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:43.180
And the second
number is the result

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:47.380
of many, many decades of very
torturous calculations sitting

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:49.300
down with a pen and
paper and trying

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:53.740
to predict from first principles
from quantum field theory what

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.800
the magnetic moment of
the electrons should be.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.005
And you can see, it's
simply spectacular.

00:28:59.005 --> 00:29:02.470
And there's nothing
like this anywhere else

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:06.010
in science with an
agreement between

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:09.850
the theoretical calculation and
the experimental measurements.

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:13.600
I think it's 12 or 13
significant figures.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.130
It's really astonishing.

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:16.570
Any other area of
science, you'll

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:18.861
be jumping up and down for
joy if you get the first two

00:29:18.861 --> 00:29:20.200
numbers right.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.661
Economics, not even that.

00:29:21.661 --> 00:29:22.160
[LAUGHING]

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.220
Just that this is where
we're at in particle physics

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.899
on a good day when
we really understand

00:29:27.899 --> 00:29:28.940
what we're doing with it.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:33.030
It's substantially better than
any other area of science.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:35.550
12 significant figures.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:37.350
But this, of course,
I've shown you

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:39.630
because this is our
best result. There

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:42.900
are many other results that
are nowhere near as good.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:45.420
And the difficulty comes
when those quantum vacuum

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:49.330
fluctuations start getting
wilder and stronger.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:50.710
So let me give you an example.

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:55.260
It should be possible for
us to sit down and calculate

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:59.020
from first principles
the mass of the proton.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.885
We have the equations.

00:30:00.885 --> 00:30:02.010
Everything should be there.

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:04.770
We just need to work
hard and figure out

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:09.390
what the mass of the proton
is just by doing calculations.

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:12.600
We've been trying to do
this for about 40 years now.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:18.090
We can get it to within an
accuracy of something like 3%.

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:19.380
Which isn't bad.

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.100
We're 3% there.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.460
But we should be
much, much better.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:28.800
We should be sort of pushing
these levels of accuracy.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.582
And the reason is very simple.

00:30:31.582 --> 00:30:32.790
We've got the right equation.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:35.370
We're pretty sure we're
solving the right equation.

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:37.810
It's simply that we're not
smart enough to solve it.

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:40.200
In 40 years, the world's
most powerful computers,

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.600
lots and lots of smart people.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:46.950
But we haven't managed
to figure this out.

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:47.850
OK.

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:49.620
There are other
situations that I

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:52.140
won't tell you about where we
don't even get off the ground.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:55.980
There are some situations
where for fairly subtle reasons

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.500
we're unable to use
computers to help us,

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:02.050
and we simply have no
idea what we're doing.

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:03.960
So it's a slightly
strange situation.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.910
We have these
theories of physics.

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:09.330
They're the best theories
we've ever developed,

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:10.590
as you can see by this.

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:13.170
But at the same time,
they're also the theories

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:16.530
that we understand
the least and it's

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:19.020
to make progress we sort of
have this strange balancing

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.320
act between increasing our
theoretical understanding

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.752
and figuring out how to
apply that to the experiments

00:31:25.752 --> 00:31:26.460
that we're doing.

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:28.168
And again, it's a
theme I'll come back to

00:31:28.168 --> 00:31:31.630
at the end of the lecture.

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:32.130
All right.

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:35.100
So so far, I've been talking
in a little bit of generality

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:38.800
about what we're made of.

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:43.410
And this is the punch line for
the halfway point of the talk.

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:45.660
You're all made
of quantum fields,

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:47.940
and I don't understand them.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:51.930
At least I don't understand them
as well as I think I should.

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:54.000
So what I want to do now
is go into a little bit

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:54.710
more specifics.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:59.550
I want to tell you exactly what
quantum fields are made of.

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:01.830
In fact, I'll tell you
exactly what quantum fields

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.750
exist in the universe.

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:05.890
And the good news
is, not many of them.

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:08.430
So I'll simply tell
you, all of them.

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:10.680
So we started with
the periodic table.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.920
This is the new periodic table.

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.150
And it's much simpler.

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.022
You know, it's much nicer.

00:32:17.022 --> 00:32:19.230
There are the three particles
that we're all made of.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:20.896
There's the electron
and the two quarks,

00:32:20.896 --> 00:32:22.410
the up quark and the down quark.

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:25.510
And as I've stressed, the
particles aren't fundamental.

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:28.890
What's really fundamental is
the field that underlies them.

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:32.430
And then it turns out
there's a fourth particle

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:34.650
that I've not discussed so far.

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:36.210
It's called the neutrino.

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:38.820
It's not important in
what we're are made of,

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.940
but it does play another
important role elsewhere

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:43.109
in the universe.

00:32:43.109 --> 00:32:44.400
These neutrinos are everywhere.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.700
You've never noticed them,
but since I began this talk,

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:49.770
something like 10
to the 14 of them

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:53.090
have streamed through the body
of each and every one of you,

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:55.929
as many coming from
above from outer space

00:32:55.929 --> 00:32:57.720
as actually coming from
below, because they

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.730
stream all the way through
the earth and then keep going.

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:02.340
They're not very sociable.

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.090
They don't interact.

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:06.090
So this is what
everything is made of.

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:09.540
These are the four
particles that form

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:13.110
the bedrock of our universe.

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:18.270
Except then something
rather strange happened.

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:21.510
For a reason that we do
not understand at all,

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:25.140
nature has chosen to
take these four particles

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:29.820
and reproduce them twice over.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:35.280
So this is actually the
list of all the fields

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.950
that make up particles
in our universe.

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:39.630
So what are we looking at here?

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:41.190
This is the electron.

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:43.710
It turns out there are
two other particles which

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:47.460
behave in every way exactly
the same as the electron,

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:49.445
except they're heavier.

00:33:49.445 --> 00:33:51.570
We call them the muon which
has a mass of something

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:54.790
like 200 times the electron,
and the tau particle,

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:57.450
which is 3,000 times
heavier than the electron.

00:33:57.450 --> 00:33:58.650
Why are they there?

00:33:58.650 --> 00:33:59.710
We have no idea at all.

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:02.220
It's one of the mysteries
of the universe.

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:05.230
There's also two more neutrinos.

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:07.260
So there are three
neutrinos in total.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:11.139
And the two quarks that we
first knew about are now

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:13.960
are joined by four others
that we call the strange quark

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.360
and the charmed quark.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.730
And then by the
time we got here,

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:21.090
we really ran out of any kind
of inspiration for naming them.

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:25.739
We called them the bottom
quark and the top quark.

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:27.000
So I should stress.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.790
We understand things very,
very well going this way.

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:31.770
We understand why they
come in a group of four.

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:35.429
We understand why they have
the properties that they do.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:37.394
We don't understand it
at all going this way.

00:34:37.394 --> 00:34:39.060
We don't know why
there's three of these

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.730
rather than two of
them or 17 of them.

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:43.710
That's a mystery.

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:45.070
But this is everything.

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:46.590
This is everything
in the universe.

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:50.154
Everything you're made of is
these three at the top there.

00:34:50.154 --> 00:34:52.320
And it's only when you go
to more exotic situations,

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.207
like particle colliders, that we
need the others on the bottom.

00:34:55.207 --> 00:34:56.790
But every single
thing we've ever seen

00:34:56.790 --> 00:35:02.270
can be made out of these
12 particles, 12 fields.

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:03.990
These 12 fields interact
with each other,

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:07.260
and they interact through
four different forces.

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.120
Two of these are
extremely familiar.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:12.190
They're the force of gravity and
the force of electromagnetism.

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:14.370
But there's also two other
forces which operate only

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:16.632
on small scales of a nucleus.

00:35:16.632 --> 00:35:18.840
So there's something called
the strong nuclear force,

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.614
which holds the quarks together
inside protons and neutrons.

00:35:21.614 --> 00:35:24.030
And there's something called
the weak nuclear force, which

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:27.430
is responsible for radioactive
decay and among other things,

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:30.270
for making the sun shine.

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:34.260
Again, each of these forces
is associated to a field.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:37.240
So Faraday taught us about
the electromagnetic field,

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.940
but there's a field
associated to this,

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:41.730
which is called the gluon
field and a field associated

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:44.760
to this which is called
the W and Z boson field.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:49.350
There's also a field
associated to gravity.

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:54.060
And this was really Einstein's
great insight into the world.

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:56.850
The field associated
to gravity turns out

00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:59.800
to be space and time itself.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.860
So if you've never
heard that before,

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.660
that was the world's
shortest introduction

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.770
to general relativity.

00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:08.190
And I'm not going to say
anything else about it.

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:11.800
I'll just let you figure
that one out for yourself.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.400
OK.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.390
So this is the
universe we live in.

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:18.500
There are 12 fields
that give matter,

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.450
I'll call the matter field,
and four other fields

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:23.040
that are the forces.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:27.120
And the world we live
in is these combination

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:32.730
of the 16 fields all interacting
together in interesting ways.

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:36.930
So this is what you should
think the universe is like.

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:41.010
It's filled with these
fields, fluid-like substances.

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:42.960
12 matter, four forces.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:46.100
One of the matter fields
starts to oscillate and ripple.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.390
Say the electron field
starts to wave up and down,

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:51.214
because there's electrons there.

00:36:51.214 --> 00:36:53.005
That will kick off one
of the other fields.

00:36:53.005 --> 00:36:56.280
It'll kickoff, say, the
electromagnetic field,

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.330
which, in turn, will also
oscillate and ripple.

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:00.137
There'll be light
which is emitted.

00:37:00.137 --> 00:37:01.470
So that will oscillate a little.

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:03.750
At some point, it
will start interacting

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:07.200
with the quark field, which in
turn will oscillate and ripple.

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.620
And the picture we end up
with is this harmonious dance

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:13.350
between all these fields,
interlocking each other,

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:16.910
swaying, moving this
way and that way.

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:21.090
That's the picture that we
have of the fundamental laws

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:23.400
of physics.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:27.030
We have a theory which
underlies all this.

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:30.960
It is, to put it simply,
the pinnacle of science.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.690
It's the greatest theory
we've ever come up with.

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:36.330
We've given it the most
astonishingly rubbish name

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:37.350
you've ever heard of.

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:39.921
We call it the standard model.

00:37:39.921 --> 00:37:41.670
When you hear the name
the standard model,

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:43.235
it sounds tedious and mundane.

00:37:43.235 --> 00:37:45.360
It should really be replaced
by The Greatest Theory

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.021
in the History of
Human Civilisation.

00:37:47.021 --> 00:37:47.520
OK?

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:51.850
That's what we're looking at.

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:52.350
OK.

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:57.210
So this is everything,
except it's not quite.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:59.950
I've actually just
missed that one field.

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:02.940
There's one extra
thing we know about,

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:06.060
which became quite
famous in recent years.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:09.180
It was a field that was
first suggested in the 1960s

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:12.930
by a Scottish physicist
called Peter Higgs.

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:18.870
And by the 1970s, it had become
an integral part of the way

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:20.910
we thought about the universe.

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:22.500
But for the longest
time, we didn't

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.360
have direct
experimental evidence

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.600
that this existed, where direct
experimental evidence means

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:30.960
we make this Higgs Field ripple
so we see a particle that's

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.390
associated to it.

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:33.270
And this changed.

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:37.620
This changed famously
four years ago at the LHC.

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:40.800
These are the two experiments
of the LHC that discovered it.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.426
They're sort of the
size of cathedrals,

00:38:42.426 --> 00:38:43.925
and just packed
full of electronics.

00:38:43.925 --> 00:38:45.060
They're astonishing things.

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:45.935
This is called Atlas.

00:38:45.935 --> 00:38:47.800
This is called CMS.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.170
That Higgs particle
doesn't last for long.

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:54.040
The Higgs particle lasts about
10 to the minus 22 seconds.

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:57.130
So it's not like you see it and
you get to take a picture of it

00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:59.890
and put it on Instagram.

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:01.170
It's a little more subtle.

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:04.540
So this is the data, and
this little bump here

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:08.456
is how we know that this
Higgs particle existed.

00:39:08.456 --> 00:39:10.330
This is a picture of
Peter Higgs being found.

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.900
So this was the
final building block.

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.179
You know, it was important.

00:39:18.179 --> 00:39:19.220
It was a really big deal.

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:21.800
And it was important
for two reasons.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:26.320
The first is that this is
what's responsible for what

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.510
we call mass in the universe.

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:31.660
So the properties of
all the particles,

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.970
things like electric
charge and mass,

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:37.510
are really a statement about
how their fields interact

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:39.200
with other fields.

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.580
So the property that we call
electric charge of an electron

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:45.520
is a statement about how
the electron field interacts

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.850
with the electromagnetic field.

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:50.770
And the property of its
mass is the statement

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:52.885
about how it interacts
with the Higgs field.

00:39:52.885 --> 00:39:57.070
So understanding this
was really needed

00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:59.440
so that we understand
the meaning of mass

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.470
in the universe.

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:01.445
So it was a big deal.

00:40:01.445 --> 00:40:03.070
The other reason that
it was a big deal

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:05.680
is, this was the final
piece of our jigsaws.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.020
We had this theory that we
called the standard model.

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.910
We've had it since the 1970s.

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:11.740
This was the final
thing that we needed

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:15.250
to discover to be sure that
this theory is correct.

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:17.050
And the astonishing
thing is this particle

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:19.950
was predicted in the 1960s.

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:22.330
50 years we've been waiting.

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:24.460
We finally created it in CERN.

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:27.220
It behaves in exactly the
way that we thought it would.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:30.070
Absolutely perfectly
behaves as we

00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:33.530
predicted using these theories.

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:34.810
OK.

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:37.924
This is going to be the
scary part of the talk.

00:40:37.924 --> 00:40:39.590
I've been telling you
about this theory.

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:43.540
And I've been waving my hands
pretending that I'm a field.

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:45.430
Let me tell you what
the theory really is.

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:48.100
Let me just show you what we do.

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:55.400
This is the equation for the
standard model of physics.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.814
I don't expect you to
understand it, not least

00:40:57.814 --> 00:40:59.980
because there are parts of
this equation that no one

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.980
on the planet understands.

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:04.690
But nonetheless, I
want to show it to you

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:06.280
for the following reason.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:10.660
This equation correctly
predicts the result

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:15.730
of every single experiment
we've ever done in science.

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:18.970
Everything is contained
in this equation.

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:23.230
This is really the pinnacle
of the reductionist approach

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:24.310
to science.

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:26.110
It's all in here.

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:27.020
So I'll admit.

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.230
It's not the simplest
equation in the world.

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:31.044
But it's not the most
complicated either.

00:41:31.044 --> 00:41:32.710
You can put it on a
t-shirt if you want.

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:34.751
In fact, if you go to
CERN, you can buy a t-shirt

00:41:34.751 --> 00:41:36.920
with this equation on it.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.280
Let me just give you a sense
of what we're looking at.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:44.290
The first term here was
written down by Albert Einstein

00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:46.180
and describes gravity.

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:49.360
What that means is
that if you could solve

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:54.820
this tiny little part of
the equation, just this R,

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:58.570
you can, for example, predict
how fast an apple falls

00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:02.800
from a tree, or the fact
that the orbits of the planet

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.920
around the sun form ellipses.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:07.600
Or you can predict what happens
when two enormous black holes

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.970
collide into each other
and form a new black hole,

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:12.750
sending out gravitational
waves across the universe.

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:15.880
Or in fact, you can predict
how the entire universe itself

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.260
expands .

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.890
All of this comes from
solving this little part

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:23.350
of the equation.

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:25.450
The next term in the
equation was written down

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:28.390
by James Clerk Maxwell,
and it tells you everything

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:30.080
about electromagnetism.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:33.390
So all the experiments that
Faraday spent a lifetime doing

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:36.160
in this building-- in fact,
all the experiments over many

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.710
centuries, from
Coulomb to Faraday,

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:42.850
to Hertz to modern developments
of lasers, everything--

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:45.400
in this tiny little
part of the equation.

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:48.255
So there's some power
in these equations.

00:42:48.255 --> 00:42:49.630
This is the equation
that governs

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:52.150
the strong nuclear force,
the weak nuclear force.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:53.590
This is an equation
that was first

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:57.740
written down by a British
physicist called Paul Dirac.

00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:59.230
It describes the matter.

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:02.500
It describes those 12 particles
that make up the matter.

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:04.060
Astonishingly,
each of them obeys

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:06.350
exactly the same equation.

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:09.010
These are the equations
of Peter Higgs.

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:11.080
And this is an
equation that tells you

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:14.200
how the matter interacts
with the Higgs particle.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.120
So everything is in here.

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.800
It's really an
astonishing achievement

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:21.160
this is our current
limit of knowledge.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:24.580
We've never done an experiment
that cannot be explained

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:25.570
by this equation.

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:27.070
And we've never
found a way in which

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:28.900
this equation stops working.

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:32.600
So this is the best thing
that we currently have.

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:33.400
OK.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.410
It's the best thing
that we currently have.

00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:39.340
However, we want to
do better, because we

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:42.610
know for sure that
there's stuff out there

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:45.730
that is not explained by this.

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:48.130
And the reason we know is
that although this explains

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:51.850
every single experiment we've
ever done here on Earth, if we

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:55.300
look out into the sky,
there's extra stuff which

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:57.340
is still a mystery.

00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:00.940
So if we look out into space,
there are, for example,

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:02.894
invisible particles out there.

00:44:02.894 --> 00:44:04.810
In fact, there's many
more invisible particles

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:06.550
than there are
visible particles.

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:08.210
We call them dark matter.

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:11.642
We can't see them, obviously,
because they're invisible.

00:44:11.642 --> 00:44:12.850
But we can see their effects.

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:14.683
We can see their effects
in the way galaxies

00:44:14.683 --> 00:44:17.380
rotate, or the way they
bend light around galaxies.

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:18.640
They're out there.

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.950
We don't know what they are.

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:22.574
There's even more
mysterious things.

00:44:22.574 --> 00:44:24.490
There's something called
dark energy, which is

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:25.860
spread throughout all of space.

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:29.292
It's also some kind of field,
although not one we understand,

00:44:29.292 --> 00:44:31.000
that's causing everything
in the universe

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.340
to repel everything else.

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:34.150
Other things.

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:39.061
We know that early in
the first few seconds,

00:44:39.061 --> 00:44:40.810
earlier than that, the
first few fractions

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:44.260
of a second after the
Big Bang, the universe

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:47.470
underwent a very rapid
phase of expansion

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:49.360
that we call inflation.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.320
We know it happened, but it's
not explained by that equation

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.130
that I just showed you.

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:56.050
So these are the kind
of things that we're

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:58.330
going to have to
understand if we're

00:44:58.330 --> 00:45:02.200
going to move forward and decide
what the next laws of physics

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.220
are that go beyond
the standard model.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.024
I could spend hours
talking about any of these.

00:45:09.024 --> 00:45:10.690
I'm going to focus
just on the last one.

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:15.890
I'm going to tell you a
little bit about inflation.

00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:21.300
So the universe is
13.8 billion years old.

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.790
And we understand
fairly well-- well,

00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:25.540
we don't understand
at all how it started.

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:28.630
We don't understand what kicked
it all off at time t equals 0.

00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:32.140
But we understand fairly well
what happened after it started.

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:38.440
And we know in particular
that for the first 380,000

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:42.160
years of the universe, it
was filled with a fireball.

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.960
And we know this for
sure because we've

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:44.890
seen the fireball.

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:47.890
In fact, we've seen it, and
we've taken a photograph of it.

00:45:47.890 --> 00:45:52.890
This is called the cosmic
microwave background radiation,

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:55.240
but a much better name
for it is the Fireball

00:45:55.240 --> 00:46:00.190
That Filled the Universe
When It Was Much Younger.

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:03.207
The fireball cools down.

00:46:03.207 --> 00:46:05.290
It's light has been streaming
through the universe

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:07.570
for 13.8 billion years.

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:08.380
But we can see it.

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:10.150
We can take this
photograph of it.

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:14.240
And we can understand
very well what

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.770
was happening in these first
few moments of the universe.

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:20.356
And you can see, it looks
literally like a fireball.

00:46:20.356 --> 00:46:21.730
There's red bits
that are hotter.

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:23.530
There's blue bits
that are colder.

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:25.210
And by studying this
flickering that you

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:27.730
can see in this picture,
we get a lot of information

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:31.840
about what was going on back
13.8 billion years ago when

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.240
the universe was a baby.

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.250
One of the main
questions we want to ask

00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:39.880
is what caused the
flickering in the fireball?

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.470
And we have an answer to this.

00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:44.080
We have an answer,
which I think is

00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:47.620
one of the most astonishing
things in all of science.

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:51.190
It turns out that
although the fireball

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:54.880
lasted for 380,000
years, whatever

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:58.780
caused this flickering
could not have taken place

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:01.960
during the vast
majority of that time.

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:04.720
Whatever caused the
flickering in this fireball

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:10.000
actually took place in the first
few very fractions of a second

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.350
after the Big Bang.

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:17.670
And what it was
was the following.

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:24.830
So when the universe
was very, very young,

00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:28.250
soon after the Big Bang,
there were no particles,

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:30.710
but there were quantum
fields, because the quantum

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:32.180
fields were everywhere.

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:35.750
And there were these
quantum vacuum fluctuations.

00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:38.220
And what happened was the
universe expanded very,

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:41.870
very quickly, and it caught
these quantum fluctuations

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:43.340
in the act.

00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:46.040
So the quantum
fluctuations were stretched

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:50.150
across the entire sky,
where they became frozen.

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:53.360
And it's these vacuum
fluctuations here

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:57.170
which are the ripples that
you see in the fireball.

00:47:57.170 --> 00:48:00.770
So it's an astonishing story,
that the quantum vacuum

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:04.760
fluctuations were taking place
10 to the minus 30 seconds

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:06.140
after the Big Bang.

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:08.330
They were absolutely
microscopic.

00:48:08.330 --> 00:48:11.630
And now we see them stretched
across the entire universe,

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:15.830
stretched 20 billion
lightyears across the sky.

00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:17.420
That's what you're seeing here.

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:20.060
And yet, you do the
calculations for this,

00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:23.760
and it matches perfectly
what you see here.

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:27.030
So this is another of the
great triumphs of quantum field

00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:27.530
theory.

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:29.210
But it leaves lots of questions.

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:32.480
The most important one is,
which field are we seeing here?

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:36.590
Which field is this that's
imprinted on the background

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:37.280
radiation?

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.170
And the answer is we don't know.

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:41.150
The only one of
the standard model

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:43.520
fields it has a hope
of being is the Higgs.

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.590
But most of us think
it's not the Higgs,

00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:47.660
but probably something new.

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:50.660
But what we'd like to do
moving forward into the future

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:53.450
is get a much better
picture of this fireball,

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:56.276
in particular get the
polarisation of the light.

00:48:56.276 --> 00:48:57.650
And by getting a
picture of this,

00:48:57.650 --> 00:48:59.510
we can understand much
better the properties

00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:01.950
of this field that
was fluctuating

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:04.861
in the early universe.

00:49:04.861 --> 00:49:05.360
OK.

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:07.970
This looking forward is
one of the best hopes

00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:11.690
that we have for going
beyond the standard model

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:13.892
and understanding new physics.

00:49:13.892 --> 00:49:15.350
In the last 10
minutes, though, I'd

00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:20.900
like to bring you back
down to Earth, sort of.

00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:24.230
We've got lots of
experiments here on Earth

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:26.010
where we're also
trying to do better,

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:29.870
where we're also trying to
go beyond the standard model

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:33.690
of physics beyond that equation
to understand what's new.

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:35.690
And there's many of them,
but the most prominent

00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:37.390
is the one I've
already mentioned.

00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:39.240
It's the LHC.

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:42.590
So what happened was the LHC
discovered the Higgs boson

00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:44.120
in 2012.

00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:47.660
And soon afterwards, it
closed down for two years.

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:49.190
It had an upgrade.

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:54.110
And last year in 2015,
the LHC turned on again

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:56.510
with twice the
energy that it had

00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:58.550
when it discovered the Higgs.

00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:00.320
And the goal was twofold.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.230
The goal was firstly to
understand the Higgs better,

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:06.950
which it has done fantastically,
and secondly, to discover

00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:11.590
new physics that lies beyond
the Higgs, new physics

00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:13.790
beyond the standard model.

00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:18.680
So before I tell
you what it's seen,

00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:20.870
let me tell you some
of the ideas we've had,

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:23.720
some of our expectations
and hopes for what

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:26.760
would happen moving forward.

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:30.230
So this is our favourite
equation again.

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:32.327
The idea has always
been the following.

00:50:32.327 --> 00:50:34.160
You know, if you were
a Victorian scientist,

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:37.410
and you go back, and you look at
the periodic table of elements,

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:41.330
then it's true that there's
patterns in there that

00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:45.270
give a hint of the structure
that lies underneath.

00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:48.551
Those numbers that
repeat themselves.

00:50:48.551 --> 00:50:51.050
Where if you're very smart, you
might start to realise that,

00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:54.860
yes, there is something deeper
than just these elements.

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:58.220
So our hope as theorists
is to look at this equation

00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:00.680
and see if maybe we
can just find patterns

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:03.920
in this equation that suggest
there might be something

00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:06.760
deeper that lies underneath.

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:08.150
And they're there.

00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:09.930
So let me give you an example.

00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:13.250
This is the equation
that describes the force

00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:16.340
of electricity and magnetism.

00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:19.250
And it's almost the same
as the equations which

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:21.620
describe the forces
for the strong force

00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:24.030
and the weak nuclear force.

00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:24.530
You can see.

00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:26.902
I've just changed letters.

00:51:26.902 --> 00:51:28.610
It's a little more
complicated than that,

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:30.710
but it's not much more
complicated than that.

00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:33.110
The three forces
really look similar.

00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:36.170
So you might wonder,
well, maybe there's not

00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:37.490
three forces in the universe.

00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:40.850
Maybe those three forces
are actually just one force.

00:51:40.850 --> 00:51:42.527
And when we think
there's three forces,

00:51:42.527 --> 00:51:44.360
it's because we're
looking at that one force

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:47.510
just from slightly
different perspectives.

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:49.084
Maybe.

00:51:49.084 --> 00:51:50.750
Here's something else,
which is amazing.

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:54.320
These are the equations
for the 12 matter

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:57.290
fields in the universe-- the
neutrinos, the electrons,

00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:58.850
and the quarks.

00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:02.180
Each of them obeys
exactly the same equation.

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:04.890
Each of them obeys
the Dirac equation.

00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:06.360
So again, you
might wonder, well,

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:07.985
maybe there aren't
12 different fields.

00:52:07.985 --> 00:52:11.540
Maybe they're all the same
field and the same particle,

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:13.370
and the fact they look
different is, again,

00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:16.120
maybe just because
at them from slightly

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:17.920
different perspectives.

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:19.600
Maybe.

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:22.960
So these ideas that
I've been suggesting

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:25.090
go by the name of unification.

00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:28.240
The idea that the three forces
are actually combined into one

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.790
is what's called
grand unification.

00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:31.660
And it's very easy.

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:34.118
It's very easy to write down
a mathematical theory in which

00:52:34.118 --> 00:52:39.940
all of these are just one
force, which appears to be

00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:43.690
three from our perspective.

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:45.200
There are other
possibilities here.

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:47.710
You might say, well
this is the matter,

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:49.570
and these are the forces.

00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:52.810
And the equations are different,
but they're not that different.

00:52:52.810 --> 00:52:55.480
Because ultimately,
they're both just fields.

00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:57.640
So you might wonder
if maybe there's

00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:59.860
some way in which the
matter and the forces

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:02.500
are related to each other.

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:04.560
Well, we have a theory
for that as well.

00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:06.670
It's a theory that's
called supersymmetry.

00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:08.050
And it's a beautiful theory.

00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:10.390
It's very deep conceptually.

00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:13.450
And it sort of, you know,
smells like it might be right.

00:53:13.450 --> 00:53:15.670
Finally, you might be
really, really bold.

00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:18.264
You might say, well, can
I just combine the lot?

00:53:18.264 --> 00:53:19.930
Can I just get rid
of all of these terms

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:21.610
and just write down
one single term

00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:23.110
from which everything
else emerges?

00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:25.540
Gravity, the forces, the
particles, the Higgs,

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:26.830
everything.

00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:29.170
I've got something for you
if you want that as well.

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:30.760
It's called string theory.

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:35.110
So we have a possibility for
a theory which contains all

00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:38.560
of this in one simple concept.

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:42.020
And the question going forward,
of course, is are these right?

00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:45.546
You know, it's very easy for us
theorists to have these ideas.

00:53:45.546 --> 00:53:47.170
And I should say
these ideas are what's

00:53:47.170 --> 00:53:50.330
driven theoretical physics for
30 years, but we want to know,

00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:51.640
are they right?

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:53.620
And we've got a way of
telling they're right.

00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:55.520
We do experiments.

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:58.240
So I should say, if you want to
know if string theory's right,

00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:01.436
we don't have any way to
test it at the moment.

00:54:01.436 --> 00:54:04.060
But if you want to know if some
of these other ideas are right,

00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:06.520
then that's what the
LHC should be doing.

00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:09.420
The reason that we built the LHC
was firstly to find the Higgs.

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:12.700
OK, it worked, and secondly,
to test these kind of ideas

00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:16.334
that we've been having
to see what lies beyond.

00:54:16.334 --> 00:54:17.500
So the LHC has been running.

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:18.910
It's been running for two years.

00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:21.190
It's been running like
an absolute dream.

00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:22.960
It's a perfect machine.

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:24.340
Two years.

00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:26.410
This is what it's seen.

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:29.890
Absolutely nothing.

00:54:29.890 --> 00:54:33.070
All of these fantastic
beautiful ideas that we've had,

00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:37.090
none of them are
showing up at all.

00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:39.940
And the question going
forward is, what are we

00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:41.710
going to do about it?

00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:43.180
How are we going
to make progress

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:45.620
in understanding the
next layer of physics

00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:47.290
when the LHC isn't
seeing anything,

00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:51.550
and our ideas just don't appear
to be the way that nature

00:54:51.550 --> 00:54:53.140
works?

00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:58.090
I should tell you, often I don't
have a good answer to this.

00:54:58.090 --> 00:54:59.860
My impression is that
most of my community

00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:03.272
is a little bit shell-shocked
by what happened.

00:55:03.272 --> 00:55:05.230
There's certainly no
consensus in the community

00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:06.890
to move forward.

00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:09.070
But I think there's
three responses

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:11.290
that sort of various
people have had that I'd

00:55:11.290 --> 00:55:12.520
like to share with you.

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:14.186
And I think all three
of these responses

00:55:14.186 --> 00:55:17.500
are reasonable up to a point.

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:20.290
The first response to the
LHC not seeing anything

00:55:20.290 --> 00:55:23.410
is the following.

00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:26.240
You young kids,
you're so pessimistic.

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.660
It's all doom and
gloom with you.

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:29.380
You need a little
bit more patience.

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:30.400
You know, I didn't see
anything last year,

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:31.630
and I didn't see
anything this year.

00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:33.610
But next year, it's
going to see something.

00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:35.610
And if not next year,
it's the year after that

00:55:35.610 --> 00:55:36.985
that it's going
to see something.

00:55:36.985 --> 00:55:40.390
It's usually my very
illustrious senior colleagues

00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:41.770
that have this--

00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:42.520
and you know what?

00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:44.140
They could easily be right.

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:46.640
It could easily be that
next year, the LHC discovers

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.190
something astonishing,
and it sets us

00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:53.200
on the path to understanding
the next layer of reality.

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.420
But it's also true
that these same people

00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:58.310
were predicting that it would
have seen something by now.

00:55:58.310 --> 00:56:00.940
And it's also true
that this can't

00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:02.980
keep going for much longer.

00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:05.800
If the LHC doesn't see something
within, say, a two-year time

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:08.710
scale, it seems
very, very unlikely

00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:11.590
that it's going to see
something moving forward.

00:56:11.590 --> 00:56:12.910
It's possible.

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:14.780
It just seems unlikely.

00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:18.820
So I hope with all my heart
that the LHC discover something

00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:21.110
next year or the year after.

00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:23.120
But I think we have to
prepare for the worst,

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.740
that maybe it won't.

00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:25.240
OK.

00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:26.640
Response number two.

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:31.300
Response number two, which is
sort of also by similar people,

00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:33.040
well, all our theories
are so beautiful.

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:34.498
They absolutely
have to be correct,

00:56:34.498 --> 00:56:37.480
and what we really need
is a bigger machine.

00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:40.810
10 times bigger will do it.

00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:43.090
Again, they might be right.

00:56:43.090 --> 00:56:45.190
I don't have a good
argument against it.

00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:47.500
The obvious rebuttal,
however, is that a new machine

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:48.670
cost $10 billion.

00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:52.180
There's not too many
governments in the world

00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:57.350
that have $10 billion to spare
for us to explore these ideas.

00:56:57.350 --> 00:56:58.230
There's one.

00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:59.326
The one is China.

00:56:59.326 --> 00:57:01.450
And so if this machine is
going to be built at all,

00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:03.491
it's going to be built by
the Chinese government.

00:57:03.491 --> 00:57:06.130
I think the Chinese government
would see it as extremely

00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:08.689
attractive if the whole
community of particle

00:57:08.689 --> 00:57:10.480
physicists and engineers
that are currently

00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:13.290
based in CERN and Geneva
move to a town that's

00:57:13.290 --> 00:57:14.890
slightly north of Beijing.

00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:18.160
I think they'd view that as
political and economic gain,

00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:19.990
and there's a real
chance they may

00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:21.550
decide to build this machine.

00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:25.160
If they do, it's about 20
years for it to be built.

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:29.210
So we're waiting
slightly longer.

00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:32.260
There's a third response.

00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:34.080
And I should say
the third response

00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:36.370
is kind of the camp I'm in.

00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:38.650
I should mention upfront,
it's speculative ,

00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:42.220
and it's probably not
endorsed by most of my peers.

00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:46.630
So this is really just my
personal opinion at this point.

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:48.893
This is my take on this.

00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:58.030
This is the equation
that we know is right.

00:57:58.030 --> 00:58:00.580
This is sort of the bedrock
of our understanding.

00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.560
But although we know
it's right, there's

00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:06.850
an awful lot in this equation
that we haven't understood.

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:09.040
There's an awful lot
to me that's still

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:11.689
mysterious in this equation.

00:58:11.689 --> 00:58:13.480
So although this equation
looked like there

00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:16.330
were suggestions of
unification, maybe they're

00:58:16.330 --> 00:58:17.950
just red herrings.

00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:20.380
And maybe if we just
work harder in trying

00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:22.990
to understand this
equation more,

00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:27.890
we'll find that there are
other patterns that emerge.

00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:30.460
So my response is, I think
that maybe we should just

00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:34.360
go back to the drawing
board and start

00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:37.300
to challenge some of the
assumptions and paradigms

00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:40.490
that we've been holding
for the past 30 years.

00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:43.240
So I feel quite
energised, actually,

00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:44.830
by the lack of
results for the LHC.

00:58:44.830 --> 00:58:45.610
You know?

00:58:45.610 --> 00:58:48.130
Sort of it feels good to
me that everyone was wrong.

00:58:48.130 --> 00:58:52.040
You know, it's when we're wrong
that we start to make progress.

00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:55.600
So I sort of feel
quite happy about this,

00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:59.600
and think that there's a very
real chance that we could just

00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:01.660
start thinking about
different ideas.

00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:04.240
I should say that there
are hints in here.

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:06.670
There are hints to me
about mathematical patterns

00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:08.130
that we haven't explored.

00:59:08.130 --> 00:59:09.940
There's hints in this
about connections

00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:11.170
to other areas of science.

00:59:11.170 --> 00:59:12.711
Things like condensed
matter physics,

00:59:12.711 --> 00:59:14.620
which is the science
of how materials work,

00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:17.950
or quantum information
science, which is the attempt

00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:19.450
to build a quantum computer.

00:59:19.450 --> 00:59:22.720
All these fantastic
subjects have new ideas,

00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:25.960
which sort of feed in
to the kind of questions

00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.400
that we're asking here.

00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:30.940
So I'm quite optimistic
that moving forward,

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:33.310
we can make progress,
maybe not the progress

00:59:33.310 --> 00:59:36.610
that we thought we'd make a few
years ago, but just something

00:59:36.610 --> 00:59:38.780
new.

00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:40.330
So that's the
punchline of my talk.

00:59:40.330 --> 00:59:45.570
The punchline is that this is
the single greatest equation

00:59:45.570 --> 00:59:47.740
that we've ever written down.

00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:52.680
But I hope that someday, we
can give you something better.

00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:54.460
Thank you for your attention.

00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:58.187
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:58.187 --> 01:00:00.520
There's nothing discrete about
the Schrodinger equation.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:03.500
The Schrodinger
equation is something

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:07.502
to do with a smooth
field-like wave function.

01:00:07.502 --> 01:00:08.960
The discreteness
is something which

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:11.070
emerges when you solve
the Schrodinger equation.

01:00:11.070 --> 01:00:13.900
So it's not built into
the heart of nature.
