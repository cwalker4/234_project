&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY.

00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:36.300
THIS YEAR, TRAGICALLY, A LOT OF
PEOPLE IN THE WHITE COMMUNITY

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.366
HAVE FOUND OUT ABOUT THE LIFE OF
AFRICAN AMERICANS IN FERGUSON,

00:02:41.366 --> 00:02:41.966
BALTIMORE, NORTH CHARLESTON,
OTHER PLACES AROUND THE UNITED

00:02:41.966 --> 00:02:42.633 align:start position:0%
STATES.

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:46.500
DO YOU THINK THE AWARENESS THAT
HAS RISEN THROUGH THESE GARAGE

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.366 align:start position:0%
TRAJ DEES HAS CHANGED ANYTHING,
AT LEAST THROUGH DIALOGUE.

00:02:49.366 --> 00:02:52.900 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WHITE PEOPLE WATCHING, GOOGLE
JANE ELLIOT, SHE HAS AN

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.966 align:start position:0%
EXPERIMENT, THE BLUE AND
BROWNIDE EXPERIMENT.

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:57.900 align:start position:0%
I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO WATCH
THAT, IT WILL ACTUALLY GROW YOU.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.300 align:start position:0%
YOU NO, BACK TO STUFF THAT WILL
MAKE YOU LAUGH.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.133
IF WHITE PEOPLE ARE NOW JUST
DISCOVERING THAT IT'S BAD FOR

00:03:03.133 --> 00:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
BLACK OR WORKING CLASS PEOPLE IN
AMERICA, THEY'RE A LOT MORE

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
BLIND THAN I THOUGHT AND THEY'RE
A LOT MORE CHOOSING TO BE

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.600 size:75% position:38%
IGNORANT THAN I THOUGHT.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.033 align:start position:0%

00:03:18.466 --> 00:03:22.233 align:start position:0%
AND UNTIL WE CALL A SPADE A
SPADE AND THIS PROBLEM IS COMING

00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:24.800
FROM CONDITIONS WE'RE CREATING
OR ALLOWING TO HAPPEN AS A WHITE

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.400 size:81% position:41%
GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO HOLD A
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF POWER --

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.900 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK THERE'S A
SYSTEMIC ATTEMPT IN THE UNITED

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.433 size:81% position:41%
STATES TO ISOLATE POOR AND
MINORITIES, TO PUT THEM IN

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:37.900 align:start position:0%
COMMUNITIES THAT CAN BE
CONTROLLED?

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.433
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT AN ATTEMPT AT ALL.

00:03:39.433 --> 00:03:40.133 align:start position:0%
IT'S SUCCESSFUL.

00:03:40.133 --> 00:03:43.733 align:start position:0%
IF YOU LOOK AT DALY AND THE
HIGHWAYS IN, WHICH HE BUILT THE

00:03:43.733 --> 00:03:45.200
HIGHWAYS TO SEG GAILT PEOPLE.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.933 align:start position:0%
THERE'S NO ROUND-ABOUT WAY TO DO
IT.

00:03:47.933 --> 00:03:48.233 align:start position:0%
ABSOLUTELY.

00:03:48.233 --> 00:03:50.466 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AGAIN, SPEAKING
FOR ALL WHITE PEOPLE WHAT, CAN

00:03:50.466 --> 00:03:55.300
WE-- WHAT CAN WE DO TO BRIDGE
THE GAP BETWEEN THE COMMUNITIES

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.033 align:start position:0%
OF COLOR?

00:03:56.033 --> 00:03:58.533 align:start position:0%
SHOULD YOU-- YOU OWN BARBER
SHOPS.

00:03:58.533 --> 00:04:01.233 align:start position:0%
SHOULD WHITE PEOPLE START
GETTING THEIR HAIR CUT AT BLACK

00:04:01.233 --> 00:04:01.566 align:start position:0%
BARBER SHOPS?

00:04:01.566 --> 00:04:02.533 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I HOPE SO.

00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:04.800
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BECAUSE THERE ARE
CONVERSATIONS GOING ON AT THOSE

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
BARBER SHOPS THAT WE'RE NOT PART
OF.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.100 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; AND WHITE PEOPLE PAY $50 FOR
HAIR CUTS, SO, ABSOLUTELY.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.800 align:start position:0%
I WOULD LIKE THAT.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.033 align:start position:0%
I WOULD LIKE THAT.

00:04:13.033 --> 00:04:19.566 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I SPEAK AT COLLEGES OFTEN, AND

00:04:19.566 --> 00:04:23.633

00:04:23.633 --> 00:04:24.300 size:84% position:42%
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MESSAGE.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.033 align:start position:0%

BEING TAKING FULL ADVANTAGE OF
AN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THAT CAN

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.666
HELP THEM IN THEIR COMMUNITY.

00:05:01.666 --> 00:05:04.933 size:84% position:42%
