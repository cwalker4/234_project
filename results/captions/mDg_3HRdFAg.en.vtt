00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.480
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.480
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.510
On the "NewsHour" tonight: A Boeing 737 crashes
in Ethiopia.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.920
It's the second in under a year for this model
of jetliner, raising concerns over the safety

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.340
of the airplane.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:25.570
Then: President Trump unveils his 2020 budget,
including an additional $8.6 billion for a

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.930
southern border wall.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.109
We talk with Mr. Trump's top economic adviser.

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.800
Plus, we are on the ground at the U.S. southern
border with a report on the conditions that

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.960
migrants face and the strained resources of
Border Patrol.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.940
ANTHONY PORVAZNIK, Yuma Sector Border Patrol:
We can't arrest our way out of the problem.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.360
That's not going to solve the problem.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.739
And this is not a Border Patrol solve.

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.140
This is -- this comes from legislation, updated
laws.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.200
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:05.340
(BREAK)

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.790
JUDY WOODRUFF: The ripple effects of an air
disaster on the African content have reached

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.530
around the globe tonight.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.760
The Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday killed
all 157 people on board.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.140
Now several countries and a dozens of airlines
have grounded their models of the Boeing 737

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.430
MAX 8.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.090
Neil Connery of Independent Television News
reports from Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.310
NEIL CONNERY: Scattered across a field, the
sorry wreckage of a plane that was the pride

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:46.140
of its fleet and the heartbreaking reminders
of 157 people entrusted to its care.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.170
There are clothes, pieces of the cabin's interior,
even a book marked with notes for a conference

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.790
that was never reached.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.630
The emergency teams are digging down because
part of the fuselage is buried in the earth.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.890
From the air, it's clear there is a huge crater,
possibly an indication that the plane came

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.600
down almost vertically and at great speed.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.359
But why an aircraft just a few months old
should fail so catastrophically just minutes

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:24.829
after leaving Addis Ababa is a question the
aviation world needs answering.

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:30.530
What remains of flight ET-302 lies strewn
over a wide area.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:38.640
Six minutes after taking off, the Boeing 737
MAX 8 aircraft fell from the skies above.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.719
Investigators are now trying to piece together
exactly what happened.

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:49.129
The safety of this particular aircraft is
now under intense scrutiny.

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:56.870
Last October, a similar passenger plane operated
by Lion Air crashed off the coast of Indonesia.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.930
Many of those on board yesterday's Ethiopian
Airlines flight had been U.N. officials, environmentalists,

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.260
and charity workers heading for a conference
in Kenya.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.300
Today, at that conference, delegates observed
a minute's silence for their colleagues who

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.790
never arrived to join them.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.049
Ethiopian Airlines' staff also held a vigil,
remembering their lost crew.

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:30.060
JUDY WOODRUFF: Investigators in Ethiopia did
find the plane's two black box recorders today.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.450
And there are now many questions being asked
about the engineering of this plane and its

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.450
software.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.739
Our Miles O'Brien, who watches the aviation
business, joins us from Boston.

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:40.959
Miles, hello.

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.220
So from what we know about this airplane and
what we know about not only this crash, but

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.370
the one of a very similar model, the same
model that occurred last October, what does

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.529
it point to in terms of possible causes?

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:59.450
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, you have to be careful
connecting the dots this early, of course,

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.450
Judy.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.989
But a modern airliner such as the 737 MAX
8 simply just doesn't fall from out of the

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:06.989
clear blue sky.

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.969
And you have had in a matter of months two
of these aircraft, practically brand-new,

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:15.340
doing just said almost in the exact same phase
of flight.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.590
And so that raises all kinds of alarm bells.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.890
But until those black boxes, that flight data
recorder and that cockpit voice recorder,

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.860
are analyzed, we can't say for certain.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.660
In the meantime, though, there is what I would
say a prudent response in some cases to ground

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.100
these aircraft until it is known one way or
another if there's some endemic, fundamental

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.950
flaw in this aircraft design.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.620
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what is it about?

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.450
We know that Boeing changed the design to
a degree when they designed this MAX 8.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.670
What was changed?

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.350
MILES O'BRIEN: The key was, they wanted to
make it longer-range and more fuel-efficient.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.370
So it meant putting a bigger engine on it,
heavier and wider in diameter.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.670
So, in order for it to fit under the wings
and still have ground clearance, they had

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.200
to move the engine up and forward.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.170
What that did was, every time the aircraft
in particular was in full thrust scenario,

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:14.280
which would be the case on takeoff, it tended
to have -- make the nose point a little higher

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.780
a little faster than 737 pilots were used
to.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.980
So, instead of redesigning the wing and increasing
the height of the landing gear, as you might

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.090
expect, what Boeing did was change the computer,
which is in between the flight controls and

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.930
the human and the controls themselves, and
put in some software which detected this nose

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.190
high attitude.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.500
And the computer commands the aircraft to
go down if the pilot gets it too high.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.510
If it goes too high, the plane will fall out
of the sky.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.810
That was the intent.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.640
But the theory that many are worried about
here is that somehow that software is either

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.740
overreacting or the sensors themselves gave
bad data to the computer.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:58.960
JUDY WOODRUFF: And is there an issue potentially,
Miles, with regard to the training of pilots

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.110
to fly this aircraft?

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.370
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, pilots were not fully
briefed on this system, didn't know exactly

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.830
what was going on in the computers.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.330
And this is where you get into all kinds of
discussions about where the line is drawn

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.480
between human control and automation in all
kinds of complex systems.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.950
So now they know.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.920
And the FAA has issued an airworthiness directive
that came after the last crash, the Lion Air

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:31.320
crash in November, which mandates a look at
the computer software, a look at the sensors,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:37.110
and some additional training so pilots can
understand how to disconnect this system.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:42.140
Now, any pilot flying this aircraft would
have known about the Lion Air crash and known

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.010
how to disconnect this system.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:49.300
The question is, in a situation where you're
nose down very quickly and going very fast

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.520
toward the ground at a relatively low altitude,
is there enough time?

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.610
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, as you pointed out, Miles,
the FAA is saying that these planes are airworthy.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:05.530
And yet flight attendant associations, some
of them are saying their attendants are right

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.700
to ask questions, perhaps to say they won't
fly these airlines.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.110
How significant is all that?

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:16.720
MILES O'BRIEN: I think it's reasonable to
ask these questions, as should passengers.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.830
Now, the FAA just this afternoon issued something
I have never heard of before, a continued

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.660
airworthiness notification.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.610
That is not an official legal document.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:31.350
It's more on the order of a memo to the world
saying, here's what we did in November.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.140
We introduced this airworthiness directive.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:39.590
We gave the airlines until April to do this,
to fix this, figure out the problem and fix

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:40.590
it.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.270
In the meantime, we're just going to wait
and watch.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:46.970
I think all options remain on the table, but
they're watching very closely to see what

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:51.750
those flight data recorder and cockpit voice
recorders hold in store for them.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:57.560
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as you are saying, a
number of questions still very much top of

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.560
mind.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.650
Miles O'Brien, thank you very much.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.680
MILES O'BRIEN: You're welcome, Judy.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:07.000
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's other news: U.S.-backed
forces advanced slowly against the last pocket

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.160
of Islamic State territory in Eastern Syria.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.940
Rocket fire and air assault continued into
the night on Baghouz.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:20.270
Some 500 I.S. fighters are believed holed
up there, along with several thousand women

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:21.390
and children.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:26.840
An Iranian court has reportedly issued a verdict
in the case of a detained American, Michael

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.840
White.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.010
An Iranian news agency says a verdict has
been issued.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.969
But there is no word on what it is, or even
what the charges are.

00:08:34.969 --> 00:08:39.210
White is a U.S. Navy veteran arrested in Iran
last July.

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:42.539
In all, five Americans are being held there.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:49.010
In Malaysia, a court released Siti Aisyah,
who had been accused of killing the half-brother

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.899
of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un.

00:08:51.899 --> 00:08:57.050
She flew home to Indonesia, and was reunited
with her parents after prosecutors dropped

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.339
the murder charge.

00:08:58.339 --> 00:09:00.560
Her lawyer said they gave no reason.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.870
GOOI SOON SENG, Attorney for Siti Aisyah:
Siti Aisyah has been discharged from the court

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:04.870
today.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:11.550
And we are grateful that the public prosecutor
has in fact come to this conclusion, because

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:16.310
we still truly believe that she is merely
a scapegoat and she is innocent.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:21.060
JUDY WOODRUFF: A second defendant remains
on trial, accused of using a nerve agent to

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.730
kill Kim Jong-nam in 2017.

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:30.600
The defense says the two women thought they
were part of a prank that was actually organized

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.089
by North Korean intelligence.

00:09:33.089 --> 00:09:38.209
The longtime president of Algeria has announced
that he will not seek a fifth term in the

00:09:38.209 --> 00:09:40.399
face of widespread protests.

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:44.410
Abdelaziz Bouteflika had initially said he
would run again.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:49.300
That prompted widespread demonstrations in
recent weeks, as crowds demanded that he give

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.230
up power after 20 years in office.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:58.230
Today's announcement delays the April election,
and calls for a special body to write a new

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.230
constitution.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:03.730
Schools and businesses across Venezuela were
forced to close again today, as much of the

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.769
country remained blacked out.

00:10:05.769 --> 00:10:10.870
A power station explosion in Caracas added
to the misery for people who have been living

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.290
without electrical power since Thursday.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:18.800
MAILEN GONZALEZ, Caracas Resident (through
translator): Friday, Saturday and Sunday were

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.800
horrible.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.829
I was going crazy with no water, no electricity.

00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:26.100
For God's sake, how long are we going to continue
like this?

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.790
The government doesn't want to accept that
it's their fault, because they have to carry

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.569
out maintenance, and, for years, they have
not done this.

00:10:32.569 --> 00:10:36.990
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Washington, Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo rejected the Venezuelan

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:41.279
government's claims that the U.S. is behind
the blackout.

00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:45.920
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May travel
to Strasbourg, France, tonight in a bid to

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.930
salvage her Brexit plan.

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:53.529
She is hoping for concessions from the European
Union before the House of Commons votes on

00:10:53.529 --> 00:10:56.449
a plan that it rejected once already.

00:10:56.449 --> 00:10:57.610
The vote is tomorrow.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:01.149
The scheduled date for Brexit is March the
29th.

00:11:01.149 --> 00:11:05.720
Back in this country, Democrats announced
that Milwaukee will host their presidential

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.040
nominating convention next year.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.570
The city won out over Houston and Miami.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:16.209
Republicans have already picked Charlotte,
North Carolina, for their 2020 convention.

00:11:16.209 --> 00:11:20.309
And on Wall Street, a tech rally pushed the
broader market higher.

00:11:20.309 --> 00:11:25.889
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 177
points to close at 25650.

00:11:25.889 --> 00:11:31.430
The Nasdaq rose 136 points, and the S&amp;P 500
added 34.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:36.309
Still to come on the "NewsHour": President
Trump's top economic adviser on the latest

00:11:36.309 --> 00:11:42.160
White House budget; an on-the-ground report
from the U.S. southern border; we break down

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:48.439
the weekend's 2020 Democratic campaign activity;
a conversation with author Marlon James on

00:11:48.439 --> 00:12:04.610
his new novel, "Black Leopard, Red Wolf";
and much more.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:08.509
The White House today released President Trump's
budget for 2020.

00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:15.269
The record $4.7 trillion plan calls for increased
military spending and large cuts to domestic

00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:16.339
programs.

00:12:16.339 --> 00:12:21.569
It also includes an additional $8.6 billion
for the president's controversial border wall.

00:12:21.569 --> 00:12:25.420
We turn now to the president's chief economic
adviser, Larry Kudlow.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.040
Larry Kudlow, welcome to the "NewsHour."

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.040
It's good to see you.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.040
LARRY KUDLOW, Director, National Economic
Council: Thank you, Judy.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.310
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, the president is asking
Congress to approve the largest budget ever,

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.829
as we said, $4.7 trillion.

00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:39.670
Doesn't achieve balance for another 15 or
so years.

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:44.480
Trillion-dollar deficits for the rest of his
term, and yet he ran promising to get rid

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.480
of the deficits.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.639
He's going in the opposite direction.

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:51.540
LARRY KUDLOW: Well, I think, actually, if
you look at those numbers as a share of GDP,

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:57.619
which is the real burden, spending and borrowing
comes down every year, I guess deficits from

00:12:57.619 --> 00:13:03.430
a peak of about 5 percent this year, and then
it will go down a steady glide path in the

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:04.490
out years.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:07.050
And then I think the key points are very simple.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:10.279
Number one, this is an economic growth budget.

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:16.860
We maintain our tax rate reduction, our rollback
of regulations and red tape, our opening of

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.189
energy and our trade reforms.

00:13:19.189 --> 00:13:22.890
The growth in 2018 came in at 3.1 percent.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:23.890
That was our view.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.689
We think there's more 3 percenters out there.

00:13:26.689 --> 00:13:29.499
That's probably the best way to get the budget
gap down.

00:13:29.499 --> 00:13:31.600
And, of course, we have to limit spending.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.820
And the president is going to be tough on
domestic programs, roughly about a 5 percent

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.990
reduction, at least for this year.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:41.300
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I want to ask you about
the spending cuts in just a minute.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.019
But you mentioned growth, 3 percent, the administration's
projecting.

00:13:44.019 --> 00:13:48.399
But, as you know, some very respected independent
folks, the Federal Reserve, is projecting

00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:51.410
2 percent, but sliding downward.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:55.059
The Congressional Budget Office is projecting
under 2 percent.

00:13:55.059 --> 00:13:59.329
You have got the Center for a Responsible
Federal Budget, they are saying your growth

00:13:59.329 --> 00:14:04.389
projections are unrealistic -- quote -- "based
on accounting gimmicks and fantasy assumptions."

00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:05.389
LARRY KUDLOW: Yes.

00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:06.389
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, how do you prove them all
wrong?

00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:08.120
LARRY KUDLOW: Well, we will just see.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.589
The proof of that pudding will be in the eating.

00:14:10.589 --> 00:14:15.220
Everybody disagreed with us in 2018, said
we couldn't get 3 percent economic growth

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.360
after the tax cuts were passed.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.360
And we did.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:24.380
And, again, the view here is, we are promoting
incentives in the economy.

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.880
We have had tremendous increases in business
investment.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:32.360
We have also had 100 percent expensing for
new equipment.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.279
That has spurred business investment.

00:14:34.279 --> 00:14:35.779
There's money coming in offshore.

00:14:35.779 --> 00:14:38.959
We're the hottest economy in the world.

00:14:38.959 --> 00:14:41.889
The president's trade policies, I think, are
contributing to confidence.

00:14:41.889 --> 00:14:46.070
We are on the verge of what I hope will be
a historic deal with China.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:47.490
Perhaps we will talk about that.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:52.139
In other words, people have doubted our supply-side
tax cuts.

00:14:52.139 --> 00:14:54.100
So far, we won round one.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:58.350
I'm going roll the dice again, and I'm going
to take the over and suggest that we will

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.740
be right again this year, and many of our
critics will not be.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.629
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you are hanging a lot
of this on these tax cuts.

00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:08.959
But we now have a number of experts who are
watching those tax receipt numbers that come

00:15:08.959 --> 00:15:09.959
in regularly.

00:15:09.959 --> 00:15:14.499
And they are saying that they do not add up
to what is anything like the kind of growth

00:15:14.499 --> 00:15:17.249
that the administration had projected off
these tax cuts?

00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:20.649
LARRY KUDLOW: Well, actually, overall revenues
are up about 10 percent.

00:15:20.649 --> 00:15:22.139
So that's a pretty good number.

00:15:22.139 --> 00:15:26.209
And let me say, one of the people that are
skeptical of us, the Congressional Budget

00:15:26.209 --> 00:15:33.839
Office, nonetheless, their estimates before
taxes and most recently after the taxes, they

00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:41.139
have argued, they have said, there's roughly
$7 trillion of higher nominal GDP.

00:15:41.139 --> 00:15:48.499
And from that comes about $1.2 trillion in
extra revenues, so that the tax cuts are about

00:15:48.499 --> 00:15:50.760
80 percent paid for overall.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.459
That includes the individuals.

00:15:52.459 --> 00:15:55.329
The corporate tax cuts are completely paid
for.

00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:57.619
So we're already seeing the results here.

00:15:57.619 --> 00:16:04.319
And, again, what matters, we have had record
blue-collar employment, raises arising from

00:16:04.319 --> 00:16:05.639
the latest reports, 3.4 percent.

00:16:05.639 --> 00:16:12.069
The unemployment rate is all the way down
to 3.8 percent, across the board, low unemployment.

00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:13.980
Women -- I'm proud of this, actually.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.540
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me...

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:20.920
LARRY KUDLOW: We have made efforts -- 65-some-odd
percent of the new jobs created in the last

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.220
year have come from women.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.699
So I think we're striking everywhere and we
are succeeding.

00:16:25.699 --> 00:16:27.369
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me ask you.

00:16:27.369 --> 00:16:30.920
Obviously, there are other views, but let
me come to this -- the larger picture here

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:38.720
on spending cuts, increasing spending in defense,
cutting parts of the budget that are non-defense,

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.389
so-called discretionary, much of it domestic.

00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:46.129
So, there's been a kind of a deal between
the two political parties for the last decade

00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:51.239
or so in this very partisan era, that for
every dollar of spending in one direction

00:16:51.239 --> 00:16:55.660
or another on defense, there would be an equal
movement in non-defense.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:56.910
You have broken with that approach.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:03.980
You have got here a 5 percent increase in
defense and a huge cut on the rest of the

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:04.980
budget.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.240
How do you explain that?

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.669
LARRY KUDLOW: Well, I think it's a question
of priorities.

00:17:08.669 --> 00:17:13.980
And I think we'd like to break this nexus
where everybody gets more spending.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:18.520
On the military side, where we have added,
we think we have got to have the greatest

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.269
military in the world.

00:17:20.269 --> 00:17:24.429
We have to have the best technology regarding
military.

00:17:24.429 --> 00:17:27.429
We have commitments overseas that we have
to keep.

00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:30.090
And so we're honoring all those commitments.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:34.170
On the domestic side, I think spending has
been too rapid.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:38.541
There are number of programs -- and I can't
go through every one of them, but there are

00:17:38.541 --> 00:17:43.890
number of programs that we think are not efficient
and the country can do without.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:44.890
Some cases...

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:45.890
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me just be specific here.

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:48.760
You're cutting the Environmental Protection
31 percent.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.500
You're cutting the Education budget by 10
percent.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:57.540
You're cutting elements of Medicaid, elements
of welfare, raising work requirements.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:02.220
The question coming out of this is, are the
American people going to be better off with

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.220
this budget?

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.950
LARRY KUDLOW: Well, look, food stamps have
come way down.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:09.440
I mean, we have lost five million people on
food stamps.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.279
That's a terrific thing.

00:18:11.279 --> 00:18:16.279
Other poverty areas, homeless vets, for example,
that number has dropped by 5 percent.

00:18:16.279 --> 00:18:23.240
We had added in our tax plan tremendous assistance
to low-income workers, child credits, earned

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.240
income tax credits.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:29.460
I mean, we think that the essential safety
net is being preserved, and then some.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.649
But I want to say growth solves a lot of problems.

00:18:33.649 --> 00:18:39.080
So, more and more federal spending is not
a recipe for growth, will not help the people

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.779
that we -- some people think it will.

00:18:41.779 --> 00:18:45.600
And so why should we continue to spend in
an unlimited way?

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.780
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're going to have another
conversation about growth the next time -- next

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:49.780
time we have you on.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.450
But let me do finally ask you about the border
wall.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.700
You're asking $8.6 billion.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.860
You only asked for $1.6 billion last year,
when you had a Republican majority in the

00:18:58.860 --> 00:18:59.860
Congress.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:04.431
Even right -- right now, with this Congress,
Republicans are expressing doubts about that

00:19:04.431 --> 00:19:05.431
much money.

00:19:05.431 --> 00:19:09.850
Are you -- is the president looking for another
showdown with the Congress over this, I mean,

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:11.610
looking for another government shutdown potentially?

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:15.179
LARRY KUDLOW: The president is essentially
looking for border security.

00:19:15.179 --> 00:19:17.300
And that includes building a wall.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:22.760
And we have brought in all the experts from
inside the government, Customs, ICE, DHS and

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.760
so forth.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.020
And that's what we decided we needed.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:31.220
My view, it's absolutely essential that we
have this border security because we have

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:36.899
an economic crisis, a humanitarian crisis,
illegals flooding over the border.

00:19:36.899 --> 00:19:40.690
This has to be stopped for the safety and
security of the United States.

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:43.870
So I think the president has made a very effective
case.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:49.510
If there is going to be a battle with Congress,
then so be it, but the experts that we have

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:52.070
talked to believe that this is the exactly
the right number.

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:53.120
JUDY WOODRUFF: But so be it.

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.450
You're saying, if that's what comes, the president's
prepared for it?

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:58.520
LARRY KUDLOW: Well, I think you have to fight
for your principles.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.600
And, again, I think border security on the
southern border is essential.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:07.929
I think it's essential, frankly, to the longevity
of the country.

00:20:07.929 --> 00:20:12.440
I think we're not going to have the prosperity
and the law and order as long as we leave

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.600
that problem unsolved.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.080
I understand there are disagreements.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.850
We would love to have a bipartisan agreement
on this as time goes on.

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:21.240
There's no question about that.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.710
There are other areas of bipartisanship that
we may see.

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:28.029
But border security is essential, and I think
the president has made the case.

00:20:28.029 --> 00:20:31.030
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you know that it's the
subject of an enormous debate.

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:38.230
Larry Kudlow, thank you very much for being
here.

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:44.529
LARRY KUDLOW: Thank you, Judy.

00:20:44.529 --> 00:20:51.130
JUDY WOODRUFF: Although crossings at the U.S.
southern border are at historic lows, the

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:55.870
number of families and unaccompanied minors
entering the U.S. has been increasing.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:21:02.590
Amna Nawaz was granted access to Border Patrol's
Yuma Sector operations in Arizona.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:07.570
This is the first of two reports, starting
with a view from the U.S. side of the border.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:11.630
And a warning: Viewers may find some images
disturbing.

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:18.851
AMNA NAWAZ: Under the hot Arizona sun, with
few belongings and well-worn shoes, these

00:21:18.851 --> 00:21:25.820
migrants have just crossed onto American soil
after the nearly-4,000-mile journey from Guatemala.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.260
Some in the group allow us to shoot video.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.519
Florencio says he and his 4-year-old son,
Walter, traveled for 30 days.

00:21:30.519 --> 00:21:35.450
He's desperate for work and says there was
none back home.

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:38.740
He and the others surrendered to U.S. Border
Patrol agents.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:42.510
The agents didn't allow us to record interviews
with the group.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:47.470
But they invited us to spend a day seeing
what they do here in the Yuma Sector in Southwest

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:48.470
Arizona.

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:53.520
The groups they're encountering in recent
years have changed dramatically.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:58.250
A decade ago, 90 percent of immigrants caught
crossing illegally were single adult men from

00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:59.840
Mexico.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:06.550
Today, nearly 90 percent are families and
unaccompanied children from Central America.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:10.140
That change, they say, is stretching their
resources like never before.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:15.260
At their headquarters, Border Patrol shows
us where families are first detained.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.720
Inside the headquarters is what they call
a processing center, where families are held

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.190
for about three days.

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:23.039
And we're not allowed to shoot any picture,
but we can tell you what we saw.

00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:25.169
It's basically a giant cement room.

00:22:25.169 --> 00:22:28.590
And around the perimeter of the room are a
number of holding cells that are broken up

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:29.590
by population.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:32.370
So you have mothers and daughters, fathers
and sons.

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:37.419
But the single most crowded room was for unaccompanied
males, just dozens and dozens of teenagers

00:22:37.419 --> 00:22:40.240
lying like sardines in this one cement room.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:44.500
What really strikes you about the room, though,
is how many children there are, toddlers running

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.750
around, infants in their mother's arms.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:50.850
The one thing border officials will tell you
is everyone can agree this is no place for

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:52.899
families and children.

00:22:52.899 --> 00:22:58.320
We could record video in what they call their
Costco, a room once filled with office supplies,

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:03.799
now packed with diapers, formula, and family
essentials, unpacked here by some of the 90

00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:05.950
National Guard troops sent to backfill staffing.

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.070
ANTHONY PORVAZNIK, Yuma Sector Border Patrol:
This is what we call an enforcement zone,

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:09.840
so this is triple-layer fencing here.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:14.279
AMNA NAWAZ: Yuma Sector Chief Anthony Porvaznik
says he's asked for more agents.

00:23:14.279 --> 00:23:18.549
He already has funding from last year to update
25 miles of border fencing.

00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:19.990
ANTHONY PORVAZNIK: This will all be replaced.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.990
AMNA NAWAZ: Into what?

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.289
ANTHONY PORVAZNIK: It will be 30 feet bollard-style
fence.

00:23:23.289 --> 00:23:29.539
AMNA NAWAZ: His resources, he says, haven't
changed since 2012, but the job has.

00:23:29.539 --> 00:23:34.779
Porvaznik estimates 35 percent to 40 percent
of his current manpower goes to processing

00:23:34.779 --> 00:23:37.140
and caring for the families and children in
custody.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:41.179
ANTHONY PORVAZNIK: We just had a lady last
week who delivered twins two months premature.

00:23:41.179 --> 00:23:46.179
And they see -- they see sick kids in our
custody.

00:23:46.179 --> 00:23:52.679
And last year alone, we took 550 kids to the
hospital here, over 1,700 total here just

00:23:52.679 --> 00:23:54.419
in the Yuma area.

00:23:54.419 --> 00:23:59.200
That's a huge strain on our resources, because
they're doing things that are not enforcement-related.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.669
AMNA NAWAZ: But agents concede no barrier
is 100 percent effective.

00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:08.670
They point us towards the surveillance videos
showing families climbing over sections of

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:09.670
wall.

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.679
The 14-year-old girl in this clip broke her
vertebrae from the fall.

00:24:12.679 --> 00:24:16.919
Injuries, they say, are common and further
stretch their resources.

00:24:16.919 --> 00:24:18.090
How far back does this date?

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:20.210
ANTHONY PORVAZNIK: This dates back to about
1990.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:25.200
AMNA NAWAZ: Chief Porvaznik believes updating
older wall will dissuade people from trying

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.600
to cross illegally.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:31.090
When you see people who are willing to dig
under this and climb over barbed wire and

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:36.809
build makeshift ladders to climb over additional
fencing, do you think that that's enough to

00:24:36.809 --> 00:24:39.050
deter people to try to breach it in some way?

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:40.250
ANTHONY PORVAZNIK: The majority of the population,
yes.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:41.250
AMNA NAWAZ: Yes?

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:42.679
ANTHONY PORVAZNIK: It will deter the majority.

00:24:42.679 --> 00:24:46.799
And what we're trying to do is impede and
deny entry into this area.

00:24:46.799 --> 00:24:51.529
And so, 87 percent of the people that we apprehend
right now are family units and unaccompanied

00:24:51.529 --> 00:24:52.529
children.

00:24:52.529 --> 00:24:54.809
They won't go over a 30-foot bollard.

00:24:54.809 --> 00:24:56.900
Is it going to push it somewhere else?

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.710
Likely, yes.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:04.049
AMNA NAWAZ: Later in the day, Border Patrol
encountered a second group of Guatemalans

00:25:04.049 --> 00:25:05.130
migrants.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:08.559
This mother of two young children asked we
don't show their faces.

00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:10.610
She's fleeing her abusive husband.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:15.300
She and the rest of this group of 12 waited
across the Colorado River to get into the

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.300
U.S.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.730
CARL LANDRUM, Yuma Sector Border Patrol: These
are things that we have to interact with here

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:18.730
on the ground.

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:22.201
AMNA NAWAZ: Deputy Chief Carl Landrum walked
us through the brush to show us where they

00:25:22.201 --> 00:25:23.201
crossed.

00:25:23.201 --> 00:25:26.430
The fact that people are willing to make a
crossing like this with little kids tells

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:29.230
you what people are willing to do to come
to the States.

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:35.450
CARL LANDRUM: It definitely -- it definitely
shows that people want to experience the American

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:36.450
dream.

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:40.210
And we would like for everybody that could
be a part of that legally to be a part of

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:41.210
it.

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:45.299
AMNA NAWAZ: But immigration attorney Laura
Belous of the Arizona-based Florence Project

00:25:45.299 --> 00:25:49.280
says resources should go to immigration courts,
not physical barriers.

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.370
LAURA BELOUS, Attorney, Florence Project:
If you look at the history the border over

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:56.919
the last 20 years, increased walls within
cities then pushed people into deserts.

00:25:56.919 --> 00:26:01.450
So, if there's walls and deserts, it is going
to push people into canyons and rivers, where

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:04.070
people are likely to have even more dangerous
crossing.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:06.540
Smuggling will be even more expensive.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.909
That then makes everyone along the border
less safe.

00:26:09.909 --> 00:26:15.389
AMNA NAWAZ: Chief Porvaznik says, whatever
the solution, the current situation is unsustainable.

00:26:15.389 --> 00:26:18.950
ANTHONY PORVAZNIK: Look, we can't arrest our
way out of the problem.

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:20.380
That's not going to solve the problem.

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:24.470
So we have to figure out -- and this is not
a Border Patrol solve.

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:27.940
This is -- this comes from legislation, updated
laws.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:33.820
AMNA NAWAZ: As the policy debate in Washington
drags on, there's little relief in sight for

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:38.260
both those patrolling this border and those
seeking to cross it.

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:43.529
Officials say the vast majority of those crossing
are families seeking stability or safety,

00:26:43.529 --> 00:26:48.220
though they also say background checks sometimes
reveal someone with a criminal history.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:52.929
Judy, it's worth noting that criminal history
often means an immigration violation, not

00:26:52.929 --> 00:26:54.429
necessarily a violent crime.

00:26:54.429 --> 00:26:58.320
But Border Patrol officials' bigger concern
is who they're missing while they're busy

00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.720
caring for these families and children.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.029
So they say they want everyone to cross legally.

00:27:02.029 --> 00:27:04.059
And that will be the focus of our piece tomorrow
evening.

00:27:04.059 --> 00:27:06.110
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we're very much looking
forward to that.

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:08.030
Thank you.

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:15.730
AMNA NAWAZ: Thanks, Judy.

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:23.419
JUDY WOODRUFF: Democratic presidential hopefuls
fanned out this weekend, courting voters from

00:27:23.419 --> 00:27:25.120
Iowa to Austin.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.549
John Yang has the story.

00:27:27.549 --> 00:27:31.600
JOHN YANG: In Keene, New Hampshire, Vermont
Senator Bernie Sanders made the case for his

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:32.970
presidential candidacy.

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:33.970
SEN.

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:37.270
BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), Presidential Candidate:
I don't have to tell anyone in this room we're

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:42.610
living in an unprecedented moment in American
history.

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:49.460
And when you live in an unprecedented moment,
you need to have an unprecedented response,

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.100
which is what this campaign is about.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.100
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:57.429
JOHN YANG: A self-proclaimed Democratic socialist,
Sanders' positions were labeled impractical

00:27:57.429 --> 00:27:59.870
in the 2016 campaign.

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:05.769
Now he seems to be setting the standard his
Democratic competitors are measured against.

00:28:05.769 --> 00:28:10.870
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a
progressive, on CBS News' "Face the Nation."

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:12.490
QUESTION: Do we describe you as a capitalist?

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:13.490
What's the best...

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:14.490
SEN.

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:15.490
ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), Presidential Candidate:
Yes.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:16.490
QUESTION: ... way to describe you?

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:17.490
SEN.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:18.490
ELIZABETH WARREN: I believe in markets, markets
that work.

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:19.490
QUESTION: So if you get labeled as a socialist?

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:20.490
SEN.

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:21.490
ELIZABETH WARREN: Well, it's just wrong.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:22.490
JOHN YANG: And former Colorado Governor John
Hickenlooper, a moderate.

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:25.919
JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D), Presidential Candidate:
I'm happy to say I'm a capitalist, but I think

00:28:25.919 --> 00:28:28.230
at a certain point the labels do nothing but
divide us.

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:34.649
JOHN YANG: A new Des Moines Register/CNN poll
finds 56 percent of likely Iowa Democratic

00:28:34.649 --> 00:28:40.019
caucus-goers say they would be satisfied with
a nominee who wants the country to be more

00:28:40.019 --> 00:28:48.000
socialist; 49 percent back Medicare-for-all;
36 percent support tuition-free college.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.080
This weekend, some candidates shed the winter
coats of Iowa and New Hampshire for sunglasses

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:58.019
to appear at the South by Southwest conference
in Austin, Texas.

00:28:58.019 --> 00:29:02.159
Thirty-seven-year-old South Bend, Indiana,
Mayor Pete Buttigieg took a swipe at Vice

00:29:02.159 --> 00:29:06.379
President Mike Pence for his steadfast support
of President Trump.

00:29:06.379 --> 00:29:10.700
PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), Mayor of South Bend, Indiana:
How would he allow himself to become the cheerleader

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.900
for the porn star presidency?

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:17.409
Is it that he stopped believing in Scripture
when he started believing in Donald Trump?

00:29:17.409 --> 00:29:22.450
JOHN YANG: A Republican presidential long
shot, former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld,

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:24.759
also made the rounds in Austin.

00:29:24.759 --> 00:29:27.880
He's exploring a primary challenge to the
president.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.450
And that brings us to Politics Monday.

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:35.820
And with that, here's Stu Rothenberg, senior
editor of Inside Elections, and Susan Page,

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:37.929
USA Today's Washington bureau chief.

00:29:37.929 --> 00:29:38.929
Susan, let me start with you.

00:29:38.929 --> 00:29:43.300
Let me start with something that Speaker Pelosi
told "The Washington Post" magazine last week,

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.769
that they posted it today.

00:29:44.769 --> 00:29:48.149
She was asked whether she supported impeaching
President Trump.

00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:53.750
She said: "Impeachment is so divisive to the
country that unless there's something so compelling

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:59.669
and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think
we should go down that path, because it divides

00:29:59.669 --> 00:30:02.590
the country, and he's just not worth it."

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:06.320
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau Chief, USA Today:
This is consistent with what she's been saying

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:07.649
in the past, although it's a little blunter.

00:30:07.649 --> 00:30:08.770
It goes a step further.

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:13.090
It's consistent with what Adam Schiff and
Jerry Nadler, two of the key Democratic committee

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:14.220
chairmen, have been saying.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:18.409
But it is going to make a lot of Democrats
unhappy who believe that the right thing is

00:30:18.409 --> 00:30:21.519
to move ahead with impeachment proceedings
against the president.

00:30:21.519 --> 00:30:24.769
Nancy Pelosi, I think, is speaking from the
perspective of someone who lived through the

00:30:24.769 --> 00:30:28.100
Bill Clinton impeachment, where the House
was able to convict.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.340
The Senate was -- the House was able to impeach.

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.139
The Senate wasn't able to convict.

00:30:32.139 --> 00:30:37.389
And the party that bore the burden of a backlash
was the party that impeached -- tried to impeach

00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:38.389
the president.

00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:39.870
So I think that is the perspective.

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:43.090
But there's -- the Democrats are going to
be divided on this issue.

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:45.600
JOHN YANG: And members of her caucus are going
to be unhappy.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.600
STUART ROTHENBERG, Inside Elections: Right.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.600
Right.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.600
I agree, John.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.759
I think, basically, what she is saying is,
do Democrats want to feel good or do they

00:30:51.759 --> 00:30:53.340
want to win?

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:59.509
Many of the younger Democrats, insurgents,
anti-establishment Democrats, just can't resist

00:30:59.509 --> 00:31:01.000
themselves.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.360
They really want to take on the president
immediately, and impeachment is the way, the

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.360
most immediate way.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.669
They just don't have any patience.

00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:13.630
I think the speaker has history on her side,
and I think she's right

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:16.269
SUSAN PAGE: But it's not -- it's only a matter
of being impatient.

00:31:16.269 --> 00:31:19.519
If you believe the president had done something
impeachable, you may feel that, even if we're

00:31:19.519 --> 00:31:21.919
not going to succeed, we have an obligation
to impeach him.

00:31:21.919 --> 00:31:25.810
And you could also make the point that, with
Richard Nixon's impeachment, you didn't start

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:28.000
out with a lot of Republicans in favor of
that.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.799
It was as evidence built over time through
the impeachment hearings that there was Republican

00:31:31.799 --> 00:31:32.799
and bipartisan support.

00:31:32.799 --> 00:31:35.529
STU ROTHENBERG: Yes, but, Susan, you know
the Republicans in the Senate are not going

00:31:35.529 --> 00:31:38.149
to go along with the conviction.

00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:43.529
So, impeachment would make Democrats feel
good, but I don't think it would accomplish

00:31:43.529 --> 00:31:44.529
anything.

00:31:44.529 --> 00:31:47.700
JOHN YANG: Susan, this morning, The Washington
Post had a look inside the Trump reelection

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:48.700
campaign.

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:54.249
And it sounds like a lot of what he was doing
in 2016, big rallies, a lot of data mining,

00:31:54.249 --> 00:31:56.909
and demonizing the opposition.

00:31:56.909 --> 00:32:02.121
We heard in that tape piece what the Democrats
are talking about, Medicare for all, free

00:32:02.121 --> 00:32:03.130
college tuition.

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:08.330
Are they in a way helping -- by talking this
debate about are you a socialist, are you

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:11.649
a capitalist, are they playing into that in
any way?

00:32:11.649 --> 00:32:14.550
SUSAN PAGE: The Democrats are going to have
to figure out what kind of coalition they

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:16.010
think will defeat Donald Trump.

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:17.899
And they are not in agreement on that.

00:32:17.899 --> 00:32:22.539
There are some Democrats, like Stacey Abrams,
who came pretty close to winning a race she

00:32:22.539 --> 00:32:27.160
wasn't supposed to win for governor of Georgia,
who thinks you do that by persuading and energizing

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:32.410
your core supporters, you get young people
and minorities excited about your candidacy

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:35.159
and your bold proposals and you get them to
the polls.

00:32:35.159 --> 00:32:38.950
But there are other Democrats who say, the
way we made big inroads in the midterms last

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:43.679
November was by swinging districts that are
purple, where you have to appeal to some voters

00:32:43.679 --> 00:32:46.749
who are independent-minded or even vote Republican
sometimes.

00:32:46.749 --> 00:32:50.559
I think this is one of the things this long
primary season is going to sort out.

00:32:50.559 --> 00:32:54.460
What kind of Democrat can make the best case
that they can defeat Donald Trump?

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:57.630
Because if you -- I'll tell you one thing
Democrats are not divided on, and that is

00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:00.980
their fervent desire to deny Donald Trump
a second term.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.490
STU ROTHENBERG: I think that's a choice Democrats
don't have to make.

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:08.899
I think they need swing voters and they need
to turn out core voters, younger voters, 18

00:33:08.899 --> 00:33:13.470
to 29, significant constituency that's entering
the electorate now that is really strongly

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:14.760
Democratic.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:20.620
Non-whites, they need to get more of those
voters, but they still need to hold onto suburban

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:25.360
voters, those swing voters and college -- college
-- white women with a college degree.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.639
So I think they -- I don't think they have
to choose one path or the other.

00:33:28.639 --> 00:33:29.639
They need to do both.

00:33:29.639 --> 00:33:33.019
JOHN YANG: This is a time when the Democrats,
a lot of the Democratic candidates are introducing

00:33:33.019 --> 00:33:34.940
themselves to the country.

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:39.169
One of them, Kirsten Gillibrand, has had a
little -- or has hit a little bit of a bump.

00:33:39.169 --> 00:33:43.860
She's -- one of her big issues has been dealing
with sexual assault and sexual harassment

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.519
in the military.

00:33:45.519 --> 00:33:50.250
And now it turns out, it's being reported
by Politico, that a young woman on her staff,

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:55.680
unhappy with how her complaints about sexual
harassment and intimidation were handled,

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.740
quit.

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.039
What do you make of this, Susan?

00:33:58.039 --> 00:34:01.909
SUSAN PAGE: We have had other Democratic candidates
have problems along the same lines.

00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:06.309
Bernie Sanders has as well about his handling
during his first presidential campaign about

00:34:06.309 --> 00:34:07.480
complaints of sexual harassment.

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.750
But I think this hurts Kirsten Gillibrand
more.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:12.730
And that's because it's been her signature
issue.

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:18.040
And for her to have responded inadequately
to complaints of sexual harassment by a staffer,

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:22.840
and moving to fire the staffer who was accused
only when it was about to become public, I

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:25.359
think, makes her look hypocritical.

00:34:25.359 --> 00:34:28.481
So I think it's an issue she's going to have
to address in a really forthright way if she's

00:34:28.481 --> 00:34:29.481
going to get over it.

00:34:29.481 --> 00:34:33.000
STU ROTHENBERG: I agree completely, but I
would add this.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.169
You only have one chance to make a first impression.

00:34:36.169 --> 00:34:38.340
And we know the senator.

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:39.710
You know the senator.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.960
But most voters don't know the senator.

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:45.000
And this could be a stumble that she could
recover from easily.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.530
Elizabeth Warren, I think, has recovered from
her Native American stumble, at least partially.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:53.310
Or else this could sink Gillibrand';s campaign.

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:54.330
We will see.

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:58.150
JOHN YANG: We have also seen some new polling
out of Iowa.

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:01.300
We're talking about the Democrats have to
decide what they want.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:07.110
It's interesting that the top two candidates
are Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, who are

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:10.230
-- and they're the second choice for each
first choice.

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:14.710
You can't think of some -- two candidates
who are more different in a lot of ways on

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:15.710
policy issues.

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:19.309
SUSAN PAGE: Yes, but I would just say we're
almost a year away from the Iowa caucuses.

00:35:19.309 --> 00:35:24.859
And so I don't take the lineup, the horse
race questions on the Iowa poll so seriously.

00:35:24.859 --> 00:35:31.089
What struck me about that was the policy questions
and how liberal that the Democratic coalition

00:35:31.089 --> 00:35:32.089
is.

00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:35.410
In Iowa, there was majority support for the
Green New Deal, which I bet most people couldn't

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:41.240
define, for Medicare for all, which is a really
far-reaching health care proposal.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.470
That surprised me.

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:46.900
And that indicated that maybe Stacey Abrams'
view of things, where you want to take bold

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:49.550
positions, that's certainly what looks like
it's going to resonate in Iowa.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:50.550
STU ROTHENBERG: Yes.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:52.730
I would say Democrats know two candidates,
Sanders and Biden.

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:55.089
If you pick Sanders, then Biden is your backup
choice.

00:35:55.089 --> 00:35:57.290
If you pick Biden, it's Sanders.

00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:03.099
JOHN YANG: Stuart Rothenberg, Susan Page,
thanks so much.

00:36:03.099 --> 00:36:05.680
SUSAN PAGE: Thank you.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.260
STU ROTHENBERG: Thanks, John.

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:15.300
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: a new fantasy novel, the
first in a forthcoming trilogy set in a mythic

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.660
Africa.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:20.040
Jeffrey Brown brings us the latest entry on
the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:24.030
It's part of our Canvas, our regular arts
and culture series.

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:30.570
JEFFREY BROWN: In the writer Marlon James'
Brooklyn apartment, African masks he's collected

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:34.260
over the years, superhero toys.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.319
So here, your love of comics.

00:36:36.319 --> 00:36:37.750
MARLON JAMES, Author, "Black Leopard, Red
Wolf": Yes.

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:42.290
When I was growing up, I gobbled up so many
comics and graphic novels.

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:48.900
JEFFREY BROWN: And lots of books, including
the comics and fantasy stories he's long loved.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:54.140
The Jamaican-born James is best known for
his literary fiction, including "A Brief History

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:58.930
of Seven Killings," winner of the prestigious
Man Booker Award.

00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:05.160
Now comes "Black Leopard, Red Wolf," a tale
of magic, shape-shifting characters, bloody

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:10.660
battles and fantastic adventures, familiar
in some ways, but through a less familiar

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:11.660
lens

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:17.329
MARLON JAMES: It's almost like an African
"Arabian Nights," in that it's a story about

00:37:17.329 --> 00:37:19.559
stories.

00:37:19.559 --> 00:37:20.559
What happened?

00:37:20.559 --> 00:37:25.632
This man is telling you what happened, and
he gets very digressive along the way, telling

00:37:25.632 --> 00:37:29.700
you all other sorts of stories, other sorts
of folktales, because, if you read stuff like

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:34.030
"Arabian Nights," a story leads into a story
leads into a story leads into a story.

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:38.099
JEFFREY BROWN: I have seen you describe yourself
as a fantasy nerd.

00:37:38.099 --> 00:37:39.390
What did that mean?

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:42.119
MARLON JAMES: It means I read everything.

00:37:42.119 --> 00:37:46.500
Even my vocabulary of sci-fi cinema, I realized,
wasn't even cinema.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:51.250
First time I saw "Return of the Jedi," I was
like, oh, my God, I have never seen this.

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:52.970
And I know everything about that film...

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:53.970
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:56.170
MARLON JAMES: ... because I have read the
books, I have read the movie tie-ins and I

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:57.170
read the comics.

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:00.940
So, even my cinematic language was books.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:02.819
It was reading whatever I could get my hands
on.

00:38:02.819 --> 00:38:08.001
And, usually, that's stuff like comics or,
again, "Dragonslayer," which, again, was a

00:38:08.001 --> 00:38:09.059
movie tie-in.

00:38:09.059 --> 00:38:10.090
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:15.119
MARLON JAMES: A lot of the crucial books,
like "Lord of the Rings" and "Dune," I read

00:38:15.119 --> 00:38:16.660
as an adult.

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:19.869
Whatever had words and I could get, I would
grab it and read it.

00:38:19.869 --> 00:38:24.950
JEFFREY BROWN: What was it and what is it
about the fantasy genre that grabbed you and

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:26.190
made you want to write one?

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:31.890
MARLON JAMES: I never took kindly to the idea
that you outgrow the magical and the surreal

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:33.120
and the fairy tale.

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.120
And I still don't.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:40.180
And I have always found it weird that you're
supposed to get the point where you mature

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.330
beyond Brothers Grimm.

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:43.330
I never did that.

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:44.330
I never...

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:45.330
JEFFREY BROWN: You're supposed to grow up,
right?

00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:46.330
MARLON JAMES: Yes.

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:47.330
JEFFREY BROWN: Grow out of it?

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:48.330
MARLON JAMES: I never had that literary puberty.

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:49.330
And I don't want it either.

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:53.520
And I think, because of that, I have always
still -- I never let go of that, always wanting

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.520
that fantastical.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.980
So, I mean, I will watch even bad fantasy
films.

00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:58.980
I don't care.

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.079
Just give me a sword and some sorcery.

00:39:01.079 --> 00:39:02.079
(LAUGHTER)

00:39:02.079 --> 00:39:07.390
MARLON JAMES: I think, at some point, though,
I did start to react to people that may being

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:08.599
not included or erased.

00:39:08.599 --> 00:39:09.599
JEFFREY BROWN: People like you?

00:39:09.599 --> 00:39:14.160
MARLON JAMES: You know, black people, people
of color being erased from those narrative

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.540
-- or not even being in them in the first
place.

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:23.339
And there's a part of me that always wanted
-- always wished to see just one, somebody

00:39:23.339 --> 00:39:29.630
like me in a story with dragons and elves
and so on.

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:35.490
There is a thrill, particularly when you are
young, to see somebody like yourself in a

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:37.100
story.

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:38.120
There is.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:41.790
And it's something you notice when there's
the absence of it.

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:48.349
JEFFREY BROWN: The stories that went into
this book from African mythology, from history,

00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:49.660
where did you find it all?

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:51.410
MARLON JAMES: Everywhere, including online.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:52.800
Thank God for the Internet.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.800
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:54.800
(LAUGHTER)

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:55.800
MARLON JAMES: Old folktales.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:00.341
I found recently translated epics, and historic
-- history books written now, and the recent

00:40:00.341 --> 00:40:02.480
archaeological finds, sources.

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:07.109
And as a novelist who has written historical
novels before, that's something that's just

00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:08.109
part of the work.

00:40:08.109 --> 00:40:09.940
I mean, I will read the ship logs.

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.660
I will read the tax records.

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:15.510
I want to read the original information and
inform my own story.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:19.020
JEFFREY BROWN: You're clearly playing with
language in many different ways.

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.640
So where does the language come from?

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.640
MARLON JAMES: It comes from everywhere.

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:24.119
A lot of it is being Jamaican.

00:40:24.119 --> 00:40:26.589
The thing is, I'm not -- I'm not from the
continent.

00:40:26.589 --> 00:40:28.230
I'm not from an African country.

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:33.440
And my literary sensibility is as much shaped
by Amos Tutuola as it is by Charles Dickens.

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.440
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.290
MARLON JAMES: And I wasn't going to lose that.

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:37.290
That's who I am.

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:38.290
And that's how I write.

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:47.410
At the same time, I'm writing a novel that
is trying, at least attempting to put forward

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:52.710
a vision that is not European and is not influenced
by European values, not even by a European

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:54.160
counting system.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:58.589
So the dilemma is, how do I use this language
I know, English -- that's what I write in,

00:40:58.589 --> 00:41:03.180
that's what I speak -- but try to come up
with something that is very foreign?

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:08.559
It has to read -- if anything, the novel has
to read almost like an English translation

00:41:08.559 --> 00:41:09.559
than English.

00:41:09.559 --> 00:41:10.559
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

00:41:10.559 --> 00:41:15.920
MARLON JAMES: So, for example, some characters
speak only in the present tense, even when

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:19.290
they're talking about the past, which is also
very Jamaican.

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:24.720
All our verbs in Jamaican English stay present
tense, regardless of tense.

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.329
I thought that was just bad English.

00:41:26.329 --> 00:41:27.329
(LAUGHTER)

00:41:27.329 --> 00:41:32.850
MARLON JAMES: And fantasy does give me the
freedom, the kind of playground, to mess with

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:40.880
-- not mess with -- to play with all of that,
but also to be true to the structure of languages.

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:46.210
JEFFREY BROWN: Did you think much about who
this is intended for, who the audience is?

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:52.030
I mean, you have mostly had a literary following,
I think, right?

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:55.829
So, is this for the -- is this fantasy for
the literary lovers?

00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:56.829
(LAUGHTER)

00:41:56.829 --> 00:41:58.839
JEFFREY BROWN: Or -- and what about fantasy
lovers?

00:41:58.839 --> 00:42:00.079
Will they think it's too literary?

00:42:00.079 --> 00:42:01.079
What...

00:42:01.079 --> 00:42:02.079
MARLON JAMES: You know what?

00:42:02.079 --> 00:42:03.750
I still think I write for everybody.

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:09.660
I put a lot of trust in the reader, which
is -- I will say, yes, there are parts where

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:11.319
you might feel you're out without a paddle.

00:42:11.319 --> 00:42:12.319
Don't worry.

00:42:12.319 --> 00:42:14.040
The current is coming.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:17.010
So, I still think I write for everybody.

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:20.970
JEFFREY BROWN: You are giving the world a
trilogy, right?

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:25.150
You think people still have the attention
span to read it, stay with it?

00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:28.180
MARLON JAMES: Well, my theory is that all
those kids who read "Harry Potter" are grown

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:31.820
up now, so they have already read 900-page
novels.

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:32.820
(LAUGHTER)

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:34.030
MARLON JAMES: So, it's an odyssey.

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:38.870
Of course it's episodic, but also something
that has a sort of a through-line.

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:44.079
And if nothing else, there are good battle
scenes.

00:42:44.079 --> 00:42:45.079
(LAUGHTER)

00:42:45.079 --> 00:42:46.079
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, "Black Leopard,
Red Wolf."

00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:47.079
Marlon James, thanks very much.

00:42:47.079 --> 00:42:54.020
MARLON JAMES: Thank you for having me.

00:42:54.020 --> 00:43:02.099
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will be back shortly
with look at how to thrive even in the face

00:43:02.099 --> 00:43:03.099
of failure.

00:43:03.099 --> 00:43:06.800
But, first, take a moment to hear from your
local PBS station.

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:14.359
It's a chance to offer your support, which
helps to keep programs like ours on the air.

00:43:14.359 --> 00:43:17.900
(BREAK)

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:29.280
JUDY WOODRUFF:For those stations staying with
us, a look at people who are saving early,

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:35.540
living frugally and retiring young.Our economics
correspondent, Paul Solman, has this encore

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:36.610
report.

00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:43.730
PAUL SOLMAN:Pete Adeney almost always leaves
his Longmont, Colorado, home on two wheels,

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:45.190
instead of four.

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:51.119
It's a lot cheaper.For seven years, Pete,
AKA Mr. Money Mustache, has been preaching

00:43:51.119 --> 00:43:53.210
parsimony on his popular blog.

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:57.020
And he sure practices what he preaches.How
much do you spend a year?

00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:02.920
PETE ADENEY:We don't budget, but it seems
to always end up around $25,000 to $27,000

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:04.460
per year for the family of three.

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:10.660
PAUL SOLMAN:Plus health insurance in the low
30s.Adeney and his followers, known as Mustachians,

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:18.980
are key players in the F.I.R.E., or FIRE,
movement, Financial Independence Retire Early.And

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:20.140
we do mean early.

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:23.440
Adeney and his wife left their engineering
jobs in 2005.

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:26.380
PETE ADENEY:So, we were 30 at the time.

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:31.319
PAUL SOLMAN:Mark and Sina Ebersole no longer
have to work either.And how old are you?

00:44:31.319 --> 00:44:32.319
MARK EBERSOLE:Thirty-seven.

00:44:32.319 --> 00:44:33.319
SINA EBERSOLE:Thirty-five.

00:44:33.319 --> 00:44:38.869
PAUL SOLMAN:Michael and Ellen Robinson, both
38, stopped working full-time two years ago.

00:44:38.869 --> 00:44:43.270
MICHAEL ROBINSON:I had this concept that saving
as much as we could as early as we could would

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:46.340
allow compound interest more time to do the
work.

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:47.340
PAUL SOLMAN:How do they all do it?

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:52.859
Adeney saved 50 to 75 percent of his income
over nine years as an engineer.

00:44:52.859 --> 00:44:53.859
PETE ADENEY:We just did a little bit less
than most people of our income level, and

00:44:53.859 --> 00:44:54.859
that was enough to save it.

00:44:54.859 --> 00:44:55.859
The U.S. tradition is to spend pretty much
everything we earn.

00:44:55.859 --> 00:44:56.859
We only have like a 3 percent savings rate.

00:44:56.859 --> 00:44:57.859
You just don't do that, and you always have
a choice.

00:44:57.859 --> 00:44:58.859
PAUL SOLMAN:How much did you wind up saving?

00:44:58.859 --> 00:44:59.859
PETE ADENEY:Today, it would be about $1.1
million or a little bit less.

00:44:59.859 --> 00:45:02.420
That was what we decided was enough to live
on forever.

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:08.049
PAUL SOLMAN:On his blog, Adeney espouses the
so-called 4 percent rule: If you salt away

00:45:08.049 --> 00:45:14.760
and invest 25 times your annual spending,
you can then withdraw 4 percent of your savings

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.220
each year of retirement.

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:18.290
But isn't the market risky?

00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:22.420
PETE ADENEY:Put the money in the broad economy
through index funds, where you own thousands

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:27.440
of companies, very conservative, and it's
going to fluctuate just because the stock

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.470
market fluctuates.

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:31.839
But if you're just taking a small amount each
year, you don't care at all about that.Like,

00:45:31.839 --> 00:45:35.360
the stock market crashes, you're still taking
your little 4 percent.

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:40.339
Your — the stock market goes up, you're
still only taking 4 percent, so that averages

00:45:40.339 --> 00:45:41.339
out over time.

00:45:41.339 --> 00:45:45.369
PAUL SOLMAN:Don't spend money on things you
don't actually need, he says.

00:45:45.369 --> 00:45:46.829
And don't drive so much.

00:45:46.829 --> 00:45:52.270
PETE ADENEY:That's my biggest winning secret
to a wealthy life, is just get out of the

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:54.000
car a little bit.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Driving is way, way more expensive than what
most people think.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000
Most people think about gasoline as the cost
of driving.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Really, it's about five times higher than
that.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000
So pretend gas is $15 a gallon.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000
Then you're starting to get an estimate of
how expensive driving really is to you.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000
PAUL SOLMAN:Due to depreciation, maintenance,
insurance.Adeney saves so much because he's

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000
also a do-it-yourselfer.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Take his house.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000
PETE ADENEY:The one that we live in now, I
built almost entirely from scratch.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000
PAUL SOLMAN:So you put in your own plumbing?

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000
PETE ADENEY:Yes.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.000
PAUL SOLMAN:You did your own flooring?

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000
PETE ADENEY:Yes, that's part of a house.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000
PAUL SOLMAN:You did your own electricity?

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000
PETE ADENEY:I would do my own heart surgery
if it was safe.(LAUGHTER)

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
PAUL SOLMAN:Last year, Adeney renovated a
dilapidated building on Longmont's main street

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000
to create a co-working space for fellow Mustachians,
and added a tiny house conference room.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000
PETE ADENEY:It was just $3,000 in materials,
partially from Craigslist, and then we get

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000
a dedicated office that's year-round, insulated.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000
PAUL SOLMAN:On top of the tiny house, nourishment
that costs even less.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000
PETE ADENEY:I'm not an apple expert, but I
just call these delicious free apples.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000
PAUL SOLMAN:Delicious free.(LAUGHTER)
PETE ADENEY:So, cheers.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.000
PAUL SOLMAN:Cheers.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000
ELLEN ROBINSON:One of the ways we save money
is by only shopping at thrift stores.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000
PAUL SOLMAN:Adeney has acolytes aplenty; 38-year-old
retired teacher Ellen Robinson's trick?

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000
Don't buy new anything.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000
ELLEN ROBINSON:This is from the Loft, and
you can buy that for closer to $8, instead

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.000
of buying it for $50.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000
PAUL SOLMAN:As for the furniture in the home
Ellen shares with husband Michael and their

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000
two young children?

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000
ELLEN ROBINSON:Pretty much all hand-me-downs.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000
The couch was a hand-me-down from my grandparents.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000
These pieces of furniture right here were
hand-me-downs from when the office that Michael

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000
worked in had to downsize.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000
The lamp, a friend from my work gave that
to me.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000
PAUL SOLMAN:The coffee table?

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000
ELLEN ROBINSON:This is something I bought
at a resale shop.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000
PAUL SOLMAN:By now, it will not surprise you
that the family car is also secondhand.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.000
ELLEN ROBINSON:We bought this 2007 Prius used
for $8,000 about four years ago.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000
And it's pushing about 195,000 miles, but
it still works just fine for our family.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000
PAUL SOLMAN:One common feature of the fire
movement, credit cards used strategically.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000
ELLEN ROBINSON:So, we get 6 percent on groceries
if we use this card, so 6 percent back, 3

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000
percent on gas, and 3 percent on department
stores.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000
PAUL SOLMAN:Michael, a former salesman who
still enjoys putting in one to two days a

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000
week as a consultant, says the family could
spend less than the $44,500 they spent last

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000
year.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000
MICHAEL ROBINSON:There's some cushion in our
budget.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.000
We're not down to the bone right now, by any
means.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000
PAUL SOLMAN:Do you feel at all deprived?

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000
ELLEN ROBINSON:No, I do not feel deprived.Do
you feel deprived?

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000
MICHAEL ROBINSON:No, we don't.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000
ELLEN ROBINSON:I am not above the temptation.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000
If I walk into the mall, I am just as drawn
to all those things as anybody else.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000
But I just have a dialogue in my head about
the decision to very intentionally not buy

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000
those things, and also just very intentionally
not going to the mall.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000
PAUL SOLMAN:Restaurant visits are rare.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Instead, the retired Robinsons spend their
ample free time cooking and eating at home

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000
with their kids.But wait a second.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Aren't there many Americans who simply don't
earn enough to save anything, let alone the

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000
amounts Pete Adeney promotes?

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000
PETE ADENEY:I'm sure there are, but I also
would say that almost everybody can do better.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.430
And the lower your income level, the greater
the benefit is of figuring out where your

00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:59.619
money is going.

00:46:59.619 --> 00:47:04.180
So the median income is $60,000 or whatever
in the U.S. for a household.And what's the

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:05.570
bestselling vehicle?

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:08.720
A $30,000-plus F-150 pickup truck.

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:09.720
That's the problem.

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:12.640
We all scale everything up just a bit more
than we can afford.

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:16.410
PAUL SOLMAN:But clearly not everyone can do
what Adeney has done.

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:20.869
Even in retirement, he has earned enough from
his blog that he doesn't need to stick to

00:47:20.869 --> 00:47:22.320
his $25,000-a-year budget.

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:28.800
But he does, because, he argues, cutting consumption
isn't just about cost-saving.

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:33.680
PETE ADENEY:I would say it's immoral to drive
like a six-wheel diesel pickup truck, compared

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:38.520
to riding a bike or just picking the most
practical car for whatever your needs are.

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.880
PAUL SOLMAN:Immoral because it's polluting
the atmosphere?

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:44.089
PETE ADENEY:Yes, it's because of your effect
on other people and other living things.

00:47:44.089 --> 00:47:48.180
So, like, you're going to consume a lot more
metal and a lot more fossil fuels just to

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:50.750
carry your tiny self around.

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:58.220
PAUL SOLMAN:Adeney does have followers who
can't afford to stash away at Mustachian levels.Michelle

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:04.190
Jackson turned out for a pop-up business school
held at Mr. Mustache's co-working space to

00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:08.940
learn how to earn more, so she could save
more and retire early-ish.

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:13.150
MICHELLE JACKSON:There are many people who
would like to attain that, but maybe they

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:20.170
have to pay off debt first in order to get
to the point to invest and focus on those

00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:21.170
kinds of things.

00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:22.170
PAUL SOLMAN:How much do you owe right now?

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:23.170
MICHELLE JACKSON:The amount that I'm focused
on now, minus the students loans, is about

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:24.170
$11,000.

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:25.610
PAUL SOLMAN:And even for debt-free higher
earners like Mark and Sina Ebersole, becoming

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:28.200
financially independent began as a heavy lift.

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.500
SINA EBERSOLE:It was pretty hard at the beginning
for me, paring it down, and saving, saving,

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:31.500
saving, saving.

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:32.500
That was a very foreign concept for me.

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:33.500
PAUL SOLMAN:Did you like it?

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:34.500
SINA EBERSOLE:No.

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:36.829
It felt a little bit like, are we wasting
away our good years?

00:48:36.829 --> 00:48:42.210
PAUL SOLMAN:Ten years later, the former dance
instructor is grateful that she and Mark,

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:44.320
an engineer, work only when they want to.

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:46.030
SINA EBERSOLE:We're working on opening a ballroom
dance hall.

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:47.829
MARK EBERSOLE:It's kind of like a dance — ballroom
dance studio, but more social-focused.

00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:52.030
PAUL SOLMAN:Ellen Robinson relishes the reward
of scrimping that drives the FIRE men and

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:54.290
women seeking financial independence.

00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:59.520
ELLEN ROBINSON:So, it's not necessarily about
not working, but it's the freedom that comes

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.569
with not having to work.

00:49:01.569 --> 00:49:06.650
Right now, my kids are 4 and 2, and I'm home
with them all day everyday, and not worrying

00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:09.430
about whether or not we can buy our groceries.

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:14.550
PAUL SOLMAN:As for Mr. Money Mustache himself,
PETE ADENEY:The goal is just to live a happy

00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:18.240
existence and maybe leave the world better
than when you started.

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:23.750
So I have done small businesses like carpentry,
and a lot of dad work has been my biggest

00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:29.940
occupation, a bit of writing, some music.So,
I still have, if I'm lucky, another 55 years

00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:32.789
of retirement to go.

00:49:32.789 --> 00:49:35.040
And I will let you know how that turns out.

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:42.339
PAUL SOLMAN:And for as long as I can, I will
be all ears.This is economics correspondent

00:49:42.339 --> 00:49:56.580
Paul Solman at Mr. Money Mustache headquarters
in Longmont, Colorado.

00:49:56.580 --> 00:50:02.130
(BREAK)

00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:18.950
JUDY WOODRUFF: New Coke, the Fire Phone, big
mistakes for Coca-Cola and Amazon, but their

00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:24.510
CEOs and those of many other companies have
worked the concept of failure into their corporate

00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:25.670
culture.

00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:31.900
Letting employees fail is seen as one way
of finding the next big thing that works.

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:37.180
Novelist and professor Elizabeth McCracken
also sees the value, but in her Humble Opinion,

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:41.100
it's the darker side of failure that ends
up pushing you to success.

00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:45.049
ELIZABETH MCCRACKEN, Author, "Bowlaway": Lately,
I have been thinking about failure.

00:50:45.049 --> 00:50:50.700
For instance, it's a pet peeve of mine when
people say that an honor has humbled them.

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:52.020
It hasn't.

00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:54.220
By what definition could that happen?

00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:58.030
You might mean that you think you should remain
humble in the face of an honor.

00:50:58.030 --> 00:50:59.599
And, sure, why not?

00:50:59.599 --> 00:51:02.230
But it doesn't actually humble you.

00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:08.700
Failure, on the other hand, tends to humble
people, which is right and also good, because

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:17.070
only when you fail can you stand up and assess
the damage and then, then get really furious,

00:51:17.070 --> 00:51:19.160
and vow revenge.

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:24.690
I teach creative writing, and I always tell
my students that revenge is great motivation.

00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:29.869
People who are afraid of failure tend to say,
I'm harder on myself than anyone else is.

00:51:29.869 --> 00:51:31.589
This is never true.

00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:37.790
Or else, my problem is that I'm a perfectionist,
to which I always say, oh, you don't like

00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:40.780
failing in public, unlike the rest of us?

00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:43.970
In order to succeed, you have to risk failing.

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:50.440
We all know that, but sometimes we forget
that failure is actually good for you.

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:54.670
Your immune system needs a bit of failure
in order to be inoculated against further

00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:56.040
failure.

00:51:56.040 --> 00:52:03.210
The antibodies that failure produces are not
pretty, but they are motivating, vengeance,

00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:04.580
hubris.

00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:07.589
My most successful students have already failed.

00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:11.309
Maybe they didn't get into graduate school
the first time.

00:52:11.309 --> 00:52:14.120
Maybe they were rejected by a bunch of agents.

00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:17.580
Maybe they started a completely different
career because their parents didn't want them

00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:19.430
to be writers.

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:25.390
And failure instilled in them a particular
feeling, not a commitment to their art or

00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:27.970
sense of peace about their fate.

00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:36.660
"I thought," one student of mine said just
before she sold her novel, "I will show them."

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:41.480
We often think that the best work comes from
a place of equilibrium and support, but the

00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:48.349
thing is, equilibrium is pretty static, whereas
a well-nourished, very private sense of revenge

00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:52.940
has enough heat and light to power a city,
never mind a novel.

00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:54.160
It's almost heartwarming.

00:52:54.160 --> 00:53:00.130
Sometimes, when you think, I will show them,
the them you end up showing is yourself.

00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:03.330
JUDY WOODRUFF: Elizabeth McCracken.

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:04.799
And that's the "NewsHour" for tonight.

00:53:04.799 --> 00:53:05.799
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:53:05.799 --> 00:53:08.490
Join us online and again right here tomorrow
evening.

00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:12.000
For all of us at the "PBS NewsHour," thank
you, and we'll see you soon.
