00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.860
There is going to be a focus on the military
fighting throughout this series, starting

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.130
next episode, but it’s worth explaining
the context of the Baltic States in World

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:17.390
War Two, so that we have a clear idea of the
area the Axis and Soviets are fighting over,

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.670
and understand what motivated some of the
Baltic units that were fighting on either

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.179
side.

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:29.249
Many of the books in English (some translated
from German) like to emphasise the Soviet

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:34.679
atrocities that took place during the fighting,
and don’t mention the German atrocities,

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:39.840
even though there were many. They also don’t
explain the context of the Baltic States in

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.589
this period very well, giving an impression
that everyone was pro-German. Ultimately,

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:51.230
they’re trying to justify the Wehrmacht
and National Socialism and whitewash them

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.440
of their crimes. Many of the books were written
during the Cold War, some by Germans, and

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.409
they’re playing on the anti-Marxist mentality
that the west has. So let’s try and strike

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.979
a balance in the narrative between the two
ideologies.

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:16.690
Now it is natural for human beings to favour
one side or another - team A vs team B - but

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:23.320
as you watch this series, remember this isn’t
a football game. We shouldn’t cheer either

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.150
side on the Axis-Soviet Front. Keeping the
fate of the Baltic States in the back of your

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.189
mind, as but one example of the horrors therein,
will ensure that you view the Axis and Soviets

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.920
with equal disgust.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.820
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania share a similar,
tragic story. Essentially, they were all dominated

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:02.679
by foreign powers for around 700 hundred years.
Then on the 16th of February 1918, Lithuania

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.939
became independent from Germany - although
wouldn’t be freed from German rule until

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:13.120
the November time. On the 18th of November
1918, Latvia declared her independence from

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:21.320
Russia. And Estonia did the same on the 24th.
Latvia and Estonia won the following wars

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.730
of independence and became democratic republics,
along with Lithuania.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.250
Skipping forward to 1939, all three states
had lost their democratic status, and were

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.640
replaced by dictatorships, mainly due to the
economic or political crises of the interwar

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.780
period. In all three cases, anti-Bolshevik
and anti-Soviet sentiments led directly or

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.520
indirectly to those dictatorships.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:59.310
Then at 0200 hours on the 24th of August 1939,
barely twenty years after their independence,

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:06.540
the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed. This
carved up the Baltic nations between National

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.550
Socialist Germany to the west, and the Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics (the USSR, or

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:19.640
Soviet Union) to the east. In order to protect
Leningrad from potential threats, the pact

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.560
secretly assigned the Baltic states to the
Soviet sphere of influence.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.180
“In the event of a territorial and political
rearrangement of the regions making up the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:37.340
Baltic States (Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania)
the northern frontier of Lithuania will simultaneously

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:45.760
serve as the frontier of the spheres of interest
of Germany and the USSR. In this, Lithuania’s

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.070
interest in connection with the Vilnius District
is recognised by both parties.”

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:59.080
Hitler invades Poland on the 1st of September
1939, and Stalin does the same on the 17th.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:06.420
But the Western Allies only declare war on
Germany, not the Soviet Union. This gives

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:14.629
the Soviets a free hand on their secret claims.
Hitler had also called for all Volksdeutsche

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:22.440
- the German people outside of Germany - to
come “Heims ins Reich” (Home to the Reich).

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.639
60,000 Volksdeutsche in the Baltic States
did move to Germany during this period, as

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:35.930
did some Jews, who apparently feared the Soviet
Union more than the National Socialists.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:44.380
On the 18th of September 1939, a Polish submarine
called the Orsel, which had docked in Estonia,

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:51.979
now decided to flee to Britain. Stalin used
this as proof that the Estonians were not

00:04:51.979 --> 00:05:00.000
neutral, and gathered 160,000 troops on the
Estonian border. On the 28th of September

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:08.090
1939, Estonia had no choice but to sign an
agreement allowing 25,000 Soviet troops into

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:17.190
their territory. This was bad, since the entire
Estonian army was just 16,000 men strong at

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.360
this time.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:27.759
Then on the 4th of October 1939 Latvia met
a similar fate, as Moscow forced Latvian politicians

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:34.550
to accept 30,000 Soviet troops into their
country. The Lithuanians were forced to give

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:40.460
Memel to the Germans, and found the rest of
their country occupied by Soviet troops as

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:49.100
well. Fearing total annexation by the Soviets,
the Lithuanian president, Antanas Smetona,

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:55.990
actually offered his country as a protectorate
to the Germans. But it was no use.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.689
Soviet troops in the Baltic countries were
ordered to keep a low profile at first. But

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:09.210
by the summer of 1940, the situation had changed.
On the 14th of June, Molotov demands the dissolution

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:16.900
of the Lithuanian government in order to set
up a pro-Soviet government in its place. The

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:25.370
Lithuanians bowed to Soviet pressure on the
15th. Similar ultimatums to Estonia and Latvia

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:33.021
were delivered on the 16th. They all considered
resistance, but without outside support, they

00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:40.639
knew they’d stand little chance. On the
17th of June 1940, as the west was distracted

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:47.930
by the Fall of France, the first Soviet troops
occupied Latvia and Estonia and took control

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.940
of everything - the government and the economy.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:58.680
Social ownership and control of the means
of production had arrived in the Baltics.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:04.279
And in order to make it seem that this was
a legitimate act - as though the Baltic peoples

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:10.560
wanted this to happen - the Soviets called
elections in the three Baltic States. Voter

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:17.801
turnout was remarkable - with one precinct
in Lithuania achieving 122 percent of voter

00:07:17.801 --> 00:07:23.789
turnout. Obviously it was all totally above
board. So enthusiastic were the people to

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:28.969
have everything they owned taken off them
and their countries dissolved, that the results

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:33.909
of the elections were announced in Moscow
before the vote had even finished. Once the

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:40.770
“people’s parliaments” were elected,
they voted themselves out of existence. The

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:47.319
three Baltic states were now assimilated into
the Soviet Union, each becoming Soviet Borg

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.600
republics.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:56.020
For some reason, the Baltic people weren’t
happy. Some even took to the forests to fight

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:05.349
against the Soviets. Others sung patriotic
songs in defiance. But resistance is futile.

00:08:05.349 --> 00:08:10.129
Patriotic songs would do little when your
property is seized, and you’re killed or

00:08:10.129 --> 00:08:17.449
deported to the Gulag slave labour camps in
the east. This is what happened to the Baltic

00:08:17.449 --> 00:08:26.720
peoples over the next 12 months - a period
known in Latvia as ‘The Year of Terror’.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:33.560
“Civilians branded ‘bourgeois nationalists’
or opposed to the Soviet takeover were deported

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:42.890
to the USSR, with 15,000 people sent to Siberia
on the night of 13-14 June 1941 in wooden

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:49.800
cattle wagons. The majority would not return.”

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:56.440
People were arbitrarily separated into social
groups - those deemed to be the owner class,

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:05.420
or anyone who might be a threat to the Marxist-Socialist-state, were to be either killed or enslaved. 60,000

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:15.070
Estonians, 35,000 Latvians, and 34,000 Lithuanians
would ‘disappear’ and the majority would

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:24.140
die on the journey to, or in, the Gulag. It
was the same in Poland, where 1.5 million

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:32.680
Poles would be enslaved and sent east. The
infants, the sick, and the elderly were hit

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:42.240
the hardest by poor conditions, poor rations,
cold and disease. More round-ups were planned

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:49.830
in the future. Fear gripped the entire Eastern
population. The police were disbanded and

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:57.020
replaced with communist militias. Individuals
were banned from owning anything and businesses

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:05.570
were seized to be controlled by central administrations.
Youth and student organizations were dissolved,

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:13.280
and new state-run organizations took their
place. Books were burned. The culture and

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:19.220
life of the Baltic peoples was suppressed.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:26.640
The workers did receive large pay rises, but
since production didn’t increase, this only

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:32.850
led to massive inflation. And now that trade
wasn’t allowed with the west, and there

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:38.080
wasn’t any incentive to work (which hurt
production levels further), there were fewer

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:44.000
goods in the shops, leading to fewer things
to buy. Money is worthless if you can’t

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.460
buy anything with it. So, despite wage increases,
the Baltic peoples soon became worse off than

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.900
they were before the occupation.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:11:00.280
Ironically, while a higher percentage of Jews
in the Baltics were deported than the rest

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:09.070
of the population, the Jews were seen as non-national
- international - and thus pro-Soviet (since

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:15.120
Marxist Socialism is international-socialism)
and thus were blamed for the situation that

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:23.230
the rest of the Baltic peoples were now in. Some Jewish workers did take jobs in the Soviet-imposed

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:29.030
administration. But, while they were the minority
in that administration, the number of Jews

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:36.190
in the administration formed a larger proportion
than the Latvian or Lithuanian populations.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:41.231
So there was resentment from the rest of the
Baltic peoples as it appeared to them that

00:11:41.231 --> 00:11:47.810
the Jews were being favoured more than them
by the socialist government. Latvians and

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:53.720
Lithuanians who had also joined the Soviet
administration wanted to distance themselves

00:11:53.720 --> 00:12:00.660
from their collaboration, and so they blamed
the Jews to divert attention from their own

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:08.240
failings. As a result, anti-Semitism actually
increased in Lithuania and Latvia because

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:14.250
of the Soviet occupation, which explains why
Lithuanians and Latvians initially assisted

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:22.810
the National Socialists when they launched
Operation Barbarossa on the 22nd of June 1941.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:28.810
Crushing all opposition, the Germans reached
Latvian territory by the end of the first

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:37.570
day. By July 1941 the Germans had taken Riga.
Lithuanians and Latvians celebrated the arrival

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:44.390
of the Germans as liberators. But, not all
of them. Instead of showering their liberators

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:50.840
with flowers, the Jewish communities locked
themselves into their homes and drew their

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.680
curtains.

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:58.870
When German troops marched into the Lithuanian
capital, Kaunas, a Lithuanian Provisional

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:04.730
Government had already taken control in the
vacuum of the Soviet collapse. They were now

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:11.180
trying to recreate an administration, and
were looking forward to Lithuanian independence.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:18.200
But the National Socialists would have none
of that. As Hitler makes clear in Mein Kampf

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:26.260
and in his second book - they wanted territory,
resources, and slaves for their People’s

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:33.100
State, not free independent states. The Germans
effectively blocked this Provisional Government

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:39.730
from implementing policies, and disbanded
them after six weeks. Instead, the National

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:45.680
Socialists established ‘General District
Lithuania’ and ruled over the country with

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.230
an iron fist.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:55.680
Similar events happened in Latvia and Estonia.
The National Socialists were not interested

00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:02.120
in allowing any concept of nationalism to
form in the Baltic states. Self-government

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:11.550
was not even on the cards, despite many Lithuanians,
Latvians and Estonians hoping it would be.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:19.880
Einsatzgruppe A and various security units
(including security divisions 207 and 281,

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:25.940
who we will be seeing later) accompanied the
forward German Army units into the capital

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:32.890
cities. They set up volunteer detachments
of local Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:37.680
to round up and deal with the Jews.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:44.610
And so the killings began. Stahlecker’s
Einsatzgruppe A shot at least 200 civilians

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:52.480
in cold blood in Garsden, Lithuania, although
the number may be as high as 800. Their crime

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:59.370
was being a Jew. German police encouraged
Lithuanians to take up arms against their

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:05.760
Jewish neighbours. Yes, neighbours were now
arbitrarily separated into different social

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:14.840
groups again, this time on racial grounds
rather than class. In the capital, Kaunas,

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:21.920
1,500 Jews were murdered and synagogues were
burned in an orgy of violence on the 25th

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:32.690
to 26th of June 1941. On the 4th of July,
Einsatzgruppe A shot another 500 Jews in Kaunas

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:44.090
as well. And another 2,514 on the 6th of July.
One source states that Einsatzgruppe A alone

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:53.250
ran up a total of 138,000 Jews killed by February
of 1942.

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:59.650
Ghettos were set up in places like Kaunas
and Riga. The town of Jelgava was an important

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:05.000
railway hub which we’ll see throughout this
series. It was also where Einsatzgruppe A

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:14.090
murdered 1,550 Jews. In Riga, 400 Jews were
killed as well. And the port of Liepāja

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:21.170
also saw more shootings on the 29th of June
and the 3rd of July. The number of murders

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:25.030
just keeps going up.

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:33.900
In 1942, Salaspils Concentration Camp was
set up southeast of Riga. Malnutrition, illness

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:42.680
and death in the camp cost the lives of 250-650
children. There was also a total of 2,000

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:51.880
dead out of 21,000 prisoners between May of
1942 and September of 1944. 1,000 of these

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:59.660
deaths were Jewish. 4,000 were then transferred
to Poland and Germany where many were killed.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:04.620
I should point out that the Soviets later
exaggerated the deaths to 100,000 and told

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:10.689
of medical experiments on children, which
were untrue, however there was great suffering

00:17:10.689 --> 00:17:14.499
and death in the camp.

00:17:14.499 --> 00:17:23.250
So yes, in time, the initial joy of being
freed from Soviet occupation disappeared in

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:30.460
Latvia. The Nazis pulled down Latvian flags,
outlawed the national anthem, disbanded their

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:39.580
attempt at self-governance, and murdered Jews.
15,900 Latvians alone were then sent to Germany

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:47.649
as forced labourers. It was a new reign of
terror similar to that which the Soviets wrought

00:17:47.649 --> 00:17:49.940
upon their county.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:56.360
Now, by the time 1944 rolls around, it looked
as though the Germans would be pushed back,

00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:04.710
and the Soviets would conquer the states once
more. This problem divided society. Some welcomed

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:12.100
the Soviets back, while others were afraid
of Soviet rule. Most hated both, but it was

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:18.240
like trying to decide the lesser of two evils.
With the hope that Hitler may still grant

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:24.799
them independence - even though they had never
been promised it - some fought with the Estonian

00:18:24.799 --> 00:18:32.279
and Latvian Legions; Waffen SS divisions made
up of Estonians and Latvians. Others, including

00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:40.490
Lithuanians, joined police and auxiliary forces.
When the Soviets rolled back into the Baltics,

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:46.380
many were then forcefully recruited into the
Red Army. During the course of this series,

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:54.060
we will see how Latvians fought Latvians at
Courland.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:19:00.840
It’s worth noting that animosity exists
because some fought for the Germans and others

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:07.779
fought for the Soviets. As Hunt points out
in the book “Blood in the Forest”, Russians

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:13.049
and Germans still to this day think that if
you point out that the Latvian Legionaries

00:19:13.049 --> 00:19:21.280
were just fighting for an independent Latvia,
they’ll accuse you of “glorifying Nazis”.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:31.159
Clearly emotions still run wild. So who is
right and who is wrong here? Well what’s

00:19:31.159 --> 00:19:36.150
interesting is that it is often said that
they were volunteers - willing to fight for

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:40.500
the Germans. But is that really the case?

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:46.790
“Legally, these were deemed volunteer units,
but in fact the Germans used the conscription

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:53.720
laws of the defunct Latvian Republic as a
pretext to compel young men to choose either

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.040
labor or military service.”

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:04.280
I guess we’re glorifying National Socialists
and Marxist-Socialists by saying the Baltic

00:20:04.299 --> 00:20:10.499
States were caught between two evil regimes
and were forced to fight for one state or

00:20:10.499 --> 00:20:16.299
the other. No. While it is very much up for
debate, it appears as though these soldiers

00:20:16.299 --> 00:20:22.450
fought in hope of freeing their own countries
- and this was recognized at the time by the

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:31.129
Western Allies at least. All they wanted was
independence - a notion which had been crushed

00:20:31.129 --> 00:20:37.659
by both totalitarian ideologies. Unfortunately,
they weren’t going to get it from either

00:20:37.659 --> 00:20:44.289
side. But they didn’t know this at the time.
It’s also worth noting that, with the exception

00:20:44.289 --> 00:20:52.690
of the Arājs Battalion, the rest of the Latvian
SS didn’t kill Jews. Does that mean we’re

00:20:52.690 --> 00:21:01.450
glorifying Nazis by stating this? As Hunt
makes clear, no, not in the slightest. Socialists

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:07.519
may see the world in groups and find people
guilty by association - because they were

00:21:07.519 --> 00:21:15.059
the same class, or gender, or race - but the
reality is that people are individuals. Individuals

00:21:15.059 --> 00:21:19.399
should not be found guilty just because someone
else was found guilty - because they were

00:21:19.399 --> 00:21:25.519
part of the same social group - that makes
no sense. This would be like saying “all

00:21:25.519 --> 00:21:30.549
Jews are bad”, or “all bourgeoisie are
bad”, or “all men are bad”, which would

00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:37.840
be incorrect. So judging everyone who fought
for the National Socialists or the Marxist

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:43.549
Socialists, and calling them all evil, would
be wrong. Only those that actually committed

00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:51.029
or encouraged the crimes are guilty. This
might be an uncomfortable truth for some,

00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:57.929
but the evidence - and reality - is clear.
The Baltic States were caught between two

00:21:57.929 --> 00:22:07.360
evil regimes, two evil ideologies, two evil
empires. This wasn’t their war, but they

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:15.799
were forced to fight within it. This is the
tragedy of the Baltic States.

00:22:15.799 --> 00:22:20.799
In the next episode, we’ll get into the
fighting itself, looking at the period between

00:22:20.799 --> 00:22:27.750
the Soviet summer offensives and the end of
August 1944. This will show the events prior

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:34.110
to Army Group North falling back into the
Courland Pocket. We’ll be looking at the

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:41.620
Soviet advance to the Gulf of Riga, which
traps Army Group North in Estonia and northern

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:49.179
Latvia. And Operation Doppelkopf - the German
panzer counter-attack designed to free Army

00:22:49.179 --> 00:22:58.049
Group North from that trap. Operation Doppelkopf
is a very interesting battle in itself, especially

00:22:58.049 --> 00:23:05.900
for the year 1944, since it used 5 panzer
divisions, one panzergrenadier division, and

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:13.559
more panzer and Sturmgeschutz units as well.
That’s a huge force of armour and motorized

00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:22.470
units all in one operation, which somehow
didn’t guarantee success. Yes, the elite

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:31.129
divisions of the German Army were massed together,
but the Red Army is ready for them. The National

00:23:31.129 --> 00:23:38.510
Socialists are on the run. Can they weather
the Soviet summer storm? Thank you to my Patrons

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:43.549
for supporting me - you’ve made this series
possible. And thank you all for watching,

00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:44.280
by for now.
