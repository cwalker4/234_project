00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.310
Well, we're back with Channing
Tatum and LeBron James,

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.750
and here's what
we're going to do.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.790
Because LeBron just
opened up a school

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.970
called I Promise in Akron,
Ohio, and we're partnering

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.110
with Walmart this season.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.420
They have a program called
Associate Education, which

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.480
allows their employees to not
only get their college degrees,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.212
but Walmart actually
pays for it.

00:00:17.212 --> 00:00:19.170
And they'd like to give
your school some money,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.669
but you're going
to have to earn it.

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:22.440
And you have a
Facebook show where

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.984
you dare celebrities
to do things,

00:00:23.984 --> 00:00:25.400
and you raise money
for charities.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.950
So we're going to do
some dares, and Walmart

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.430
is going to donate $10,000 for
each dare that you actually

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.040
complete.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.540
All right.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.378
OK, so.

00:00:34.378 --> 00:00:34.878
All right.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:38.920
It's always something.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.560
Always.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.300
Always something.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.850
Always, always.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.766
Always something here.

To the blue dots we go.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.600
Step on your little blue dots.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.240
I'm going to start with LeBron.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.250
LeBron, I would like you
to drink a shot of tequila

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.000
with no hands.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.620
For-- for-- for $10,000?

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.994
Yeah, come back here.

00:00:54.994 --> 00:00:55.660
We're going to--

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.340

This is a--

That's a shot.

00:01:26.408 --> 00:01:27.390
That was real.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.740
(CHOKING) Yeah, that's real.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.080

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.850

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.610
You're going to
put on a blindfold,

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.290
and you're going to
lick a mystery item

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.081
and you're going to
let me know what it is.

00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:17.060
Ooh.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.427
It's like-- it's like kiwi.

00:02:54.427 --> 00:02:54.926
It is!

00:02:54.926 --> 00:02:55.858

How did you know that?

00:02:59.586 --> 00:03:00.382
Wow!

00:03:00.382 --> 00:03:01.548
You've licked a kiwi before.

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:03.230
Well, I thought--
no, I-- no, listen,

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.120
the first thing that came to
mind, I thought it was a ass.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.121
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:08.995
And I was like, Ellen
wouldn't do that to me,

00:03:08.995 --> 00:03:10.877
so I thought [INAUDIBLE] kiwi.

00:03:10.877 --> 00:03:11.376
No.

00:03:11.376 --> 00:03:12.302
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:12.302 --> 00:03:15.710
Also-- also, Channing would have
had to be standing on the table

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.710
for you to lick his ass.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.495
Oh my goodness.

00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:19.070
So we're going to
do one more later.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.250
If you needed something
that-- to cleanse the palate.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.170
All right.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.675
So far we have raised $30,000
for LeBron's new school--

[APPLAUSE]

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.580
--which is-- So two more dares.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.410
So that would bring it
up to $50,000, which

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.618
would be wonderful, and,
uh, but you'd have to do it,

00:03:36.618 --> 00:03:37.600
you'd have to earn it.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.591
So LeBron, what you will
do-- do you like ice cream?

00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:42.090
I do.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.750
I love ice cream.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.110
Oh good.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.620
Who doesn't?

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.119
Good.

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:45.916
Do you like hot sauce?

00:03:45.916 --> 00:03:49.521
Um-- I love hot sauce.

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:50.020
OK.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.990
Well then you're going
to get double pleasure.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.190
You're going to eat ice
cream with hot sauce on it.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.990
Oh my--

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.760
I believe it's Tabasco and
some vanilla ice cream,

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.640
which is a neutral flavor.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.340
Listen kids back home.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.150

Yes, I will.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.440

Oh.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.240
That's the combination?

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.740
Yup.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.910
I got to eat all of this?

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:18.700
No, no.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.352

Is it as good as it looks?

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.171
It's wonderful.

I feel like--

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.530
All right, that's enough.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.450
You did two big ones.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.920

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.247

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:42.038
You can keep going.

00:04:42.038 --> 00:04:44.881
You can going so I can
procrastinate on my own

00:04:44.881 --> 00:04:45.630
a little bit more.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.690

be really fun.
