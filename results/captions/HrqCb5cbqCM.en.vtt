Imprisoned without trial in Bubai's Waterfront

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.100
It's a middle eastern patch of sand that promises the best of everything.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.680
From hotels and shopping, to vibrant night life

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.020
In one generation, Dubai has transformed itself from an arab fishing village

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.020
into an international travel hub for business and pleasure

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.740
If you fly in to Dubai today, it looks like the Middle Eastern version of Las Vegas or Surfers Paradise.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.320
The behind the flashing facade has some brutal traps for the unsuspected.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.880
Qantas

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.080
is now diverting hundreds of thousands of Australians

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.400
Through Dubai on their way to Europe,but what you don't see in the Qantas Brochures is an explaination

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.580
of...

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.420

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.920
A young Australian couple um...sharing a hotel room

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.840
um...

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160
can be arrested for Adultery.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.080
If that couple are homosexuals, the consequences are even more severe

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.000
There have been women who have been gang raped there who have then been convicted

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.200
of engaging in Adultery and had prison terms imposed upon them.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.320
It might look like a middle eastern version of Las Vegas, but it's very far from that.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.920
The glittering miracle city has a legal system and has in a dark edges
