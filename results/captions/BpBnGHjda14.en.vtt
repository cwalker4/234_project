Oprah: WHEN I FIRST READ

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.980
GLENNON DOYLE MELTON'S BOOK "LOVE WARRIOR"...

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.810
[ CHEERS ]

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.050
...I FELT LIKE I KNEW THIS GIRL.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.890
SHE WAS FUNNY, AND SHE WAS WISE,

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.690
AND SHE FELT LIKE A FRIEND.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.260
TO ME, GLENNON SPOKE FOR SO MANY PEOPLE

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.160
WHO DON'T FEEL BRAVE ENOUGH TO SPEAK THEIR OWN TRUTH,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.030
AND AFTER SITTING DOWN WITH HER

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.500
ON "SUPER SOUL SUNDAY,"

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.800
I NOW CALL HER

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.770
A "SUPER SOUL VISIONARY," SHE IS.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.510
GLENNON DOYLE MELTON'S SESSION IS TITLED

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:45.080
"FIRST THE PAIN, THEN THE RISING."

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.420
HEY, BABIES!

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.890
[ SMOOCHES ]

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.660
HELLO, SUPER SOULERS!

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.590
HOLY COW, HERE WE ARE.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.330
OKAY, SO I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR US TODAY.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.970
THE FIRST ONE IS THIS --

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.000
HOW WOULD OUR LIVES AND OUR RELATIONSHIPS

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.370
AND OUR WORLD TRANSFORM

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.610
IF WE STOPPED BEING SO AFRAID OF PAIN?

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.810
WHAT IF WE JUST ONCE AND FOR ALL DECIDED

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.320
THAT WE WERE STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE PAIN IN OUR LIVES,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.650
SO INSTEAD OF HIDING FROM IT,

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.890
WE JUST RUSHED STRAIGHT TOWARD IT

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.620
AND ALLOWED OUR PAIN

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.090
TO BECOME OUR POWER.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.920
SO, I'M A PERSON WHO HID FROM PAIN

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.260
FOR THE FIRST HALF OF MY LIFE.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.660
WHEN I WAS 10 YEARS OLD,

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.100
I LOOKED OUT AT THE SCARY WORLD

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.430
AND I DECIDED THAT I WAS TOO WEAK FOR IT.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.130
SO, I DROPPED OUT OF LIFE

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.100
AND INTO BULIMIA, AND THEN ALCOHOLISM,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.740
UNTIL I WAS 25 AND FOUND MYSELF ON THAT BATHROOM FLOOR,

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.050
SHAKING AND HOLDING THAT POSITIVE PREGNANCY TEST

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.820
AND FINDING MYSELF DECIDE THAT I WANTED TO BE A MOTHER.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.520
BUT AT THAT POINT, I'D BEEN AN ADDICT FOR 15 YEARS,

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.290
SO I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO BE A HUMAN BEING.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.160
SO I DECIDED THAT MY BEST BET WOULD BE TO FAKE IT --

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.000
TO JUST LOOK AROUND FOR OTHER WOMEN

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.800
WHO SEEMED TO BE "ADULTING" SUCCESSFULLY

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.170
AND JUST COPY THEM.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.610
SO, MY CRITERIA

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.640
WAS THAT I LOOKED FOR WOMEN

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.180
WHO WERE WEARING SCARVES.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.780
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.680
RIGHT, BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.150
IF YOU ARE THE TYPE OF WOMAN

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.050
WHO GETS UP EARLY ENOUGH TO, LIKE, STOP

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.050
AND LOOK IN THE MIRROR

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.020
AND BE LIKE, "SELF,

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.890
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS OUTFIT NEEDS, IS A SCARF."

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.330
AND THEN YOU HAVE BOUGHT A SCARF AT SOME POINT,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.000
AND YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND SAID SCARF,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.530
AND ONCE YOU FIND THE SCARF,

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.230
YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THAT TYING THING,

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.300
THEN YOU ARE JUST CRUSHING LIFE, YOU KNOW?

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.410
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.310
SO, I BECAME A SCARF WEARER,

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.050
AND I BECAME A WIFE AND A MOTHER AND A WRITER

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.180
AND AN ACTIVIST BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.020
GROWING UP MEANT BECOMING THINGS, RIGHT?

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.190
AND THEN 12 YEARS LATER, MY HUSBAND TOLD ME

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.090
THAT HE'D BEEN UNFAITHFUL TO ME OUR ENTIRE MARRIAGE.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.930
AND THAT'S WHEN MY UN-BECOMING BEGAN.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.330
SO, I WENT BACK TO THERAPY

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.900
AND I SAT WITH MY THERAPIST AND I SAID,

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.040
"LOOK, I'VE NEVER BEEN IN THIS MUCH PAIN IN MY LIFE,

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.940
AND I NEED YOU TO HELP ME FIGURE OUT

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.540
HOW NOT TO WASTE IT.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.680
I HAVE TO USE THIS PAIN SOMEHOW."

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.880
AND SO, I STARTED WORKING REALLY HARD IN THERAPY

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.880
AND I LET MY THERAPIST TAKE ME BACK

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.050
ALL THE WAY TILL I WAS 10 YEARS OLD,

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.020
AND I DROPPED INTO BULIMIA.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.420
AND HERE'S WHAT WE DISCOVERED TOGETHER.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.660
SO, WE'RE ALL BORN WHOLE, RIGHT?

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.460
WE'RE TRINITIES, JUST LIKE GOD --

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.130
BODY, MIND, AND SPIRIT.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.930
AND THE HEALTHIEST OF US

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.400
LIVE OUT LIVES OF THE BODY, PHYSICAL LIVES,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.470
LIVES OF THE MIND, INTELLECTUAL LIVES,

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.570
AND LIVES OF THE SOUL, SPIRITUAL LIVES.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.640
BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ME SO YOUNG

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.710
IS THAT OUR CULTURE

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.310
GAVE ME SO MANY CONFUSING

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.980
AND OBJECTIFYING MESSAGES

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.910
ABOUT MY BODY

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.550
THAT I JUST STARTED DISASSOCIATING FROM MY BODY.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.620
RIGHT?

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.920
BECAUSE GOOD GIRLS DON'T DESIRE,

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.690
GOOD GIRLS DON'T HUNGER, GOOD GIRLS DON'T EVEN GROW.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.090
BUT I DID HUNGER, AND I DID DESIRE,

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.390
AND I DID GROW.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.800
AND SO I STARTED TO BECOME ASHAMED OF MY BODY,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.730
AND YOU CAN'T LOVE AND CLAIM

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.640
ANYTHING THAT YOU'RE ASHAMED OF.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.400
SO, I JUST VOTED MY BODY

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.140
OFF THE ISLAND OF MY SELF.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.110
RIGHT?

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.810
AND THEN, A SIMILAR THING HAPPENED

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.340
TO MY THEN-HUSBAND CRAIG --

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.840
WHEN HE WAS 10 YEARS OLD --

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.610
WELL, WHEN HE WAS BORN, HE WAS WHOLE TOO --

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.120
BODY, MIND, AND SPIRIT.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.450
BUT WHILE THE WORLD TELLS GIRLS

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.520
THAT GOOD GIRLS DON'T HUNGRY,

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.020
DON'T DESIRE,

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.260
THE WORLD TELLS LITTLE BOYS THAT BRAVE BOYS

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.230
DON'T FEEL, DON'T CRY,

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.830
DON'T MAKE THEMSELVES VULNERABLE IN ANY WAY,

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.370
AND SO CRAIG DID CRY, AND HE DID FEEL.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.230
AND SO HE STARTED TO BECOME ASHAMED OF HIS EMOTIONS,

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.810
SO HE VOTED HIS EMOTIONAL SELF OFF THE ISLAND.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.140
RIGHT?

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.280
SO, YOU SEE, WE'VE GOT WOMEN

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.110
TRYING TO LOVE MEN WITH OUR MINDS,

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.480
BUT THEY DON'T LIVE THERE,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.120
AND WE'VE GOT MEN TRYING TO LOVE WOMEN WITH THEIR BODIES,

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.750
BUT WE DON'T LIVE THERE.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.850
AND IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE LEARNED

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.320
ABOUT FEMININITY AND MASCULINITY

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.820
MAKES IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.760
FOR REAL MEN AND REAL WOMEN

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.660
TO BE FULLY HUMAN WITH EACH OTHER.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.660
WHICH MAKES IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO REALLY SEE EACH OTHER,

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.770
WHICH, OF COURSE, MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.570
TO REALLY LOVE EACH OTHER.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.700
AND I KNOW THESE THINGS ARE HUGE GENERALIZATIONS,

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.740
BUT I'M JUST SAYING THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS TRUE.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.940
OKAY?

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.280
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.890
SO, MY THERAPIST SAID, "LISTEN, GLENNON,

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.120
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA SAVE YOUR MARRIAGE,

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.390
BUT WE'VE GOT TO SAVE YOU.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.160
WE'VE GOT TO HOST A REUNION FOR YOU.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.290
WE'VE GOT TO, LIKE, VOTE YOUR BODY BACK ON THE ISLAND."

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.060
AND I SAID, "THAT SOUNDS REALLY HARD.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.300
DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE PILLS?"

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.130
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.970
AND SHE SAID, "NO MORE PILLS, GLENNON.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.170
WE'RE GOING TO DO THE WORK."

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.870
[ Mockingly ] WE'RE GONNA DO THE WORK, GLENNON.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.340
SO...

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.810
HATE THE WORK.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.750
SO, FOR ME,

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.650
PART OF THE WORK WAS TO GO TO YOGA, OKAY?

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.780
SO, YOGA ENDED UP SAVING ME,

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.950
BUT I HATED IT AT FIRST

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.450
'CAUSE IT WAS SO WOO, WOO, YOU KNOW?

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.120
SO, ONE MORNING, DURING THE SEPARATION,

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.330
I WAS JUST IN SO MUCH DESPAIR

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.700
THAT I WAS ACTUALLY SCARED OF MYSELF.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.700
LIKE, I FELT LIKE IF I STARTED CRYING AGAIN,

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.530
I JUST MIGHT NEVER STOP, RIGHT?

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.200
SO I PICKED MYSELF UP OFF THE BED

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.600
AND I WENT TO YOGA,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.870
AND I WALKED INTO THE YOGA STUDIO,

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.980
AND MY INSTRUCTOR -- MY REGULAR INSTRUCTOR --

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.310
WASN'T THERE.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.780
SO, THE RECEPTIONIST POINTED ME

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.680
TOWARDS THIS NEW ROOM.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.520
AND I SAT DOWN IN THE ROOM,

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.480
AND, YOU GUYS, IT WAS ONE MILLION,

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.090
BILLION DEGREES IN THE ROOM.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.290
AND I WAS SO ANNOYED BECAUSE MY LIFE WAS SO HARD ALREADY,

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.930
AND NOW I DIDN'T HAVE ANY AIR-CONDITIONING, RIGHT?

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.530
AND THEN, THE INSTRUCTOR WALKS IN

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.830
AND SHE SAYS...

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.170
"WELCOME TO HOT YOGA."

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.770
AND I WAS LIKE, "HOLY HELL, THIS IS ON PURPOSE."

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.710
LIKE, THEY'RE DOING THIS ON PURPOSE.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.310
AND THEN SHE SAYS THE FOLLOWING, LIKE OPRAH,

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:21.480
"NOW WE ARE GOING TO SET OUR INTENTIONS FOR THE CLASS."

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.920
AND I'M LIKE, "OKAY."

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.990
SO, THE FIRST LADY, OKAY,

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.720
ON THE MOST NO-GOOD, VERY BAD,

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.190
TERRIBLE DAY OF MY LIFE,

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.490
HAS THE NERVE TO SAY THIS SENTENCE --

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.470
"MY INTENTION IS TO RADIATE SUNLIGHT

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:45.770
TO ALL SENTIENT BEINGS."

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.880
AND EVERYBODY ELSE HAD SOME CRAP LIKE THAT,

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.010
AND ALL I COULD DO IS GLARE AT THEM AND THINK,

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.850
"WELL, MY INTENTION IS NOT STAB ALL OF YOU TO DEATH."

00:07:53.850 --> 00:08:00.460
TO DEATH!

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.190
BUT WHEN THEY GOT AROUND TO ME,

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.190
I WAS ALREADY CRYING, AND I SAID, "LOOK,

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.400
MY INTENTION IS JUST TO STAY ON THIS MAT

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.430
AND TRY TO HANDLE WHATEVER IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN HERE

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:14.440
WITHOUT RUNNING OUT THE DOOR."

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.870
AND THE ROOM GOT REALLY QUIET.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.740
AND THE INSTRUCTOR LOOKED DIRECTLY AT ME

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.750
AND SHE SAID, "OKAY, HONEY.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:25.580
YOU JUST BE STILL."

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.520
AND I WAS LIKE, ALL RIGHT, WELL, THAT SOUNDS EASY.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.020
I CAN DO THAT, RIGHT?

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.260
BUT, YOU GUYS, IT WASN'T EASY.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.590
IT WAS ACTUALLY 90 OF THE HARDEST MINUTES OF MY LIFE

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.090
BECAUSE WHAT I FOUND OUT,

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:40.800
AS I SAT THERE,

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.000
IS THAT I'D BEEN RUNNING SO HARD

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.670
AND SO FAST TO AVOID

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.870
THE CONFUSION AND PAIN OF MY PAST

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.870
AND THE WHITE-HOT RAGE

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:52.310
AND SHAME OF MY BETRAYAL

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.640
AND MY TERROR

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.480
FOR THE FUTURE OF MY BABIES

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.250
AND MY FAMILY AND MYSELF,

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.850
THAT HADN'T LET...

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.020
I HADN'T FELT ANY OF IT, RIGHT?

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.420
AND SO, FOR THIS 90 MINUTES,

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.520
I JUST HAD TO SIT THERE AND SURRENDER

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.190
TO ALL OF THE PAIN AND FEAR OF ALL OF IT,

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.160
AND I THINK IT WAS THE FIRST 90 MINUTES

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.560
IN WHICH I ALLOWED MYSELF TO FEEL WHAT IT MEANS

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.160
TO BE FULLY HUMAN

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.200
WITHOUT RUNNING OUT THE DOOR.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.100
IT FELT LIKE IT MIGHT KILL ME.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.440
BUT IT DIDN'T.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.070
AND WE GOT TO THE END OF THE YOGA CLASS

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.470
AND I WAS JUST LAYING ON MY MAT

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:26.710
AND I WAS JUST SOAKING WET FROM TEARS AND SWEAT, LIKE --

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:29.380
LIKE IT HAD BEEN SOME KIND OF ORGANIC BAPTISM.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.380
AND THE INSTRUCTOR WALKS OVER TO ME

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.250
AND SHE LEANS OVER INTO MY EAR

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:38.760
AND SHE SAYS, "HONEY, WHAT YOU JUST SURVIVED...

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:45.300
THAT WAS THE JOURNEY OF THE WARRIOR."

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.930
AND I THOUGHT, "OH, MY GOD. YOGA IS SO WEIRD.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:50.470
WHAT? LIKE, GOD.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.440
UGH! WHATEVER."

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.840
SO, I JUST, LIKE, GOT MY MAT

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.640
AND I GOT INTO MY VAN, AND I DROVE HOME,

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.010
AND ON THE WAY HOME,

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.010
YOU GUYS HAVE THESE CRAZY DEJA VU MOMENTS.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.650
SO, I PICKED UP THIS BOOK OFF MY COFFEE TABLE

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:05.980
THAT I'D READING,

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.250
AND IT FLIPPED OPEN TO THIS PAGE --

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.120
IT WAS A BOOK CALLED "WHEN THINGS FALL APART"

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.790
BY PEMA CHODRON --

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.420
AND I OPENED UP TO THIS PAGE AND READ THIS PARAGRAPH --

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.290
"IF YOU CAN SIT WITH THE HOT LONELINESS

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:22.800
FOR 1.6 SECONDS TODAY,

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.900
WHEN YESTERDAY, YOU COULD ONLY SIT WITH IT FOR ONE,

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:33.140
THEN THAT IS THE JOURNEY OF THE WARRIOR."

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.810
[ LIGHT APPLAUSE ]

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.010
AND I JUST SAT ON THE FLOOR

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.480
AND READ THAT AND READ THAT AND READ THAT,

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.950
AND I THOUGHT, "OH, MY GOD.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.720
THAT IS WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING SINCE I WAS 10 YEARS OLD --

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.590
TRYING TO OUTRUN THE HOT LONELINESS."

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.160
SO, WHEN I WAS 10 YEARS OLD WAS

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:53.000
WHEN I FIRST STARTED HAVING PAINFUL HUMAN FEELINGS,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.660
LIKE FEAR AND ANGER

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.540
AND UNWORTHINESS AND DOUBT AND UNBELONGING.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.100
BUT SINCE IN OUR CULTURE,

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:04.840
WE ONLY TALK ABOUT THE VALUE OF HAPPY, SHINY FEELINGS.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.180
I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.910
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THESE WERE JUST NORMAL HUMAN FEELINGS

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.110
THAT EVERYBODY HAD

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.150
AND THAT THEY HAD SOMETHING TO TEACH ME.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:16.790
I THOUGHT THEY WERE SOMETHING TO HIDE OR GET RID OF.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:20.660
AND THE AMAZING THING ABOUT OUR WORLD

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.460
IS THAT THE SECOND YOU START FEELING

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.630
YOUR HOT LONELINESS,

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.060
THE WORLD STARTS SHOWING YOU "EASY" BUTTONS

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.660
TO GET OUT OF IT.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.230
SO, DO YOU GUYS REMEMBER THOSE STAPLES COMMERCIALS

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.570
WHERE THINGS WOULD GET STRESSFUL

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:35.370
AND THEN A RED "EASY" BUTTON WOULD POP UP

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.210
AND YOU COULD HIT IT AND BE TRANSPORTED OUT OF YOUR PAIN

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.680
INTO THIS STRESS-FREE PLACE?

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.650
WELL, WE ALL LOVE "EASY" BUTTONS, RIGHT?

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:47.080
WE ALL HAVE THEM -- FOOD, BOOZE, SEX,

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.620
SHOPPING, SNARK, DENIAL.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.620
NOW, EVERYBODY'S IS SCROLL,

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.660
SCROLL, SCROLL, RIGHT?

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.530
THE SECOND WE START FEELING OUR HOT LONELINESS,

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.360
WE'RE LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED TO DO?

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.930
I NEED TO CHECK ON THAT GUY I KNEW IN SECOND GRADE

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:06.770
AND SEE HOW HIS TRIP TO BERMUDA IS GOING."

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:08.170
AND WE FEEL SO MUCH BETTER, RIGHT?

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.040
WE'RE NUMB, BUT THE PROBLEM IS,

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.370
WHEN WE TRANSPORT OURSELVES

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:12.910
OUT OF OUR HOT LONELINESS,

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:16.080
WE MISS ALL OF OUR TRANSFORMATION

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.350
BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED TO BECOME THE PEOPLE

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.820
WE ARE MEANT TO BECOME NEXT

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.290
IS ACTUALLY INSIDE

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:26.220
THE HOT LONELINESS OF NOW, RIGHT?

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.190
SO, WHEN WE "EASY" BUTTON OUR WAY OUT,

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.860
WE ARE LIKE CATERPILLARS WHO JUMP OUT OF THE COCOON

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.300
RIGHT BEFORE WE WOULD'VE BECOME BUTTERFLIES.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.130
BECAUSE PAIN IS ACTUALLY NOT A HOT POTATO.

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:38.900
IT'S A TRAVELING PROFESSOR,

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.940
AND IT KNOCKS ON EVERYBODY'S DOOR

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.140
AND THE WISEST ONES SAY,

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.380
"COME IN AND SIT DOWN AND DON'T LEAVE

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:49.380
UNTIL YOU'VE TAUGHT ME WHAT I NEED TO KNOW."

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.810
WE HAVE IT ALL WRONG.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.980
WE ARE AFRAID OF PAIN, BUT WE WERE MADE FOR PAIN.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.820
WE NEED TO BE AFRAID OF THE "EASY" BUTTONS, RIGHT,

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.460
BECAUSE THE JOURNEY OF THE LOVE WARRIOR

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.860
IS TO RUSH TOWARDS HER PAIN

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:06.030
AND ALLOW HER PAIN TO BECOME HER POWER.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.170
IF WE STOPPED FEARING PAIN, YOU GUYS,

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.870
WE WOULD BECOME SUCH BETTER PARENTS.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.110
SO, I WAS AT THIS PARENTING CONVENTION RECENTLY,

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:13.910
AND THIS WOMAN RAISED HER HAND

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.880
AND SHE SAID, "GLENNON...

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.910
MY FAMILY IS BROKEN

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:20.010
AND THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO TO FIX IT.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:21.680
IT'S DONE.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.280
AND MY LITTLE BOY IS IN SO MUCH PAIN,

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.790
AND EVERY DAY, I LOOK AT HIM

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:29.620
AND I THINK, 'OH, MY GOD, I HAD ONE JOB.'

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.860
MY ONE JOB WAS TO PROTECT HIM FROM PAIN,

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.700
AND I COULDN'T DO IT.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:38.200
AND I FEEL LIKE SUCH A FAILURE."

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.770
AND I SAID, "OKAY, HOLD ON A SECOND.

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.200
CAN YOU GIVE ME THREE WORDS

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.810
THAT YOU WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE THE KIND OF MAN

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.610
YOU'RE TRYING TO RAISE?"

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:50.040
AND SHE SAID, "I WANT HIM TO BE KIND,

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.080
AND I WANT HIM TO BE WISE,

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.920
AND I WANT HIM TO BE RESILIENT."

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.220
I SAID, "OKAY, THEN. WHAT IS IT IN A HUMAN LIFE

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:02.090
THAT CREATES KINDNESS AND WISDOM AND RESILIENCE.

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:03.960
IT'S PAIN."

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.960
THAT'S IT. IT'S THE STRUGGLE.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.330
IT'S NOT HAVING NOTHING TO OVERCOME --

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:13.000
IT'S OVERCOMING AND OVERCOMING AND OVERCOMING.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.070
SO, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE ARE TRYING

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.470
TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.940
FROM THE ONE THING THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO BECOME

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.270
THE PEOPLE WE DREAM THEY'LL BE?

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:27.080
[ APPLAUSE, CHEERS ]

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.350
AND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE ALL FEEL LIKE FAILURES

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.190
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE WRONG JOB DESCRIPTION?

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:35.290
BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER OUR JOB, NOR OUR RIGHT,

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.560
TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN FROM THEIR PAIN.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.860
OUR JOB IS TO POINT THEM DIRECTLY TOWARDS IT

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.130
AND SAY, "BABY, THAT WAS MEANT FOR YOU.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:45.570
AND I SEE YOUR FEAR, AND IT'S REAL, AND IT'S BIG,

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:50.410
BUT I SEE YOUR COURAGE AND IT'S BIGGER," RIGHT?

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:51.910
AND, YOU GUYS,

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.440
IF WE STOPPED FEARING PAIN,

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.240
WE WOULD BECOME SUCH BETTER FRIENDS.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.010
EVERY DAY, I HEAR FROM A WOMAN

00:14:58.010 --> 00:14:59.580
TO WHOM THE WORST HAS HAPPENED.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.550
SHE'S LOST A SPOUSE, SHE'S LOST A BABY,

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:04.750
SHE'S LOST, SHE'S LOST.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.820
AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT LOSS,

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.660
INEVITABLY, COMES A SECOND LOSS,

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.590
WHICH IS THAT SHE LOSES ALL OF HER FRIENDS.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:16.660
HER FRIENDS JUST FALL AWAY, ONE AT A TIME.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.530
AND I'VE COME TO BELIEVE THAT THAT IS NOT

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.270
BECAUSE HER FRIENDS WERE BAD PEOPLE.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.770
IT'S BECAUSE HER FRIENDS HAVE THE WRONG JOB DESCRIPTION.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:25.170
BECAUSE IF YOU ASK ANY OF THEM

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:26.810
WHY THEY STOPPED SHOWING UP,

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.380
THEY'LL SAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS --

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.780
"I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO FIX IT."

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.580
AS IF GRIEF IS SOMETHING TO BE FIXED!

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.590
RIGHT?

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.620
GRIEF IS HOLY, JUST LIKE JOY IS.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.320
GRIEF IS JUST THE PRICE OF LOVE.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.660
RIGHT?

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.460
IT'S THE RECEIPT WE HOLD IN THE AIR

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:49.330
TO SAY TO THE WORLD, "LOOK, I PAID THE PRICE...

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.200
FOR LOVE."

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.870
AND IT'S OFTEN THE ONLY THING

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:55.840
A WOMAN HAS LEFT TO PROVE SHE LOVED.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.940
AND THE LAST THING SHE WANTS IS FOR SOMEBODY TO COME IN

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.010
AND TRY TO SNATCH IT FROM HER.

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:03.080
RIGHT?

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.950
WE DON'T NEED FRIENDS WHO CAN FIX OUR PAIN.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.550
WE NEED FRIENDS WHO ARE BRAVE ENOUGH

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.120
TO BE STILL WITH PAIN --

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.790
TO LET US HAVE IT, RIGHT?

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.290
BECAUSE FRIENDSHIP -- FRIENDSHIP IS JUST TWO PEOPLE

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.690
NOT BEING GOD TOGETHER, RIGHT?

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:22.560
THIS IS FRIENDSHIP.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.730
THAT'S IT.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.300
AND, YOU GUYS, IF WE STOP FEARING OUR PAIN,

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:30.000
WE WOULD FINALLY FIND OUR PURPOSE IN OUR TRIBE.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.940
SO, THIS IS WHAT I HEAR EVERY DAY --

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.840
"I CAN'T GO THERE. IT'LL BREAK MY HEART.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.710
I CAN'T MEET HER. IT'LL BREAK MY HEART.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:38.680
I CAN'T READ THAT. IT'LL BREAK MY HEART."

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.850
BUT HEARTBREAK IS NOT SOMETHING TO BE AVOIDED.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:47.820
HEARTBREAK IS THE GREATEST CLUE OF OUR LIVES, RIGHT,

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:48.990
BECAUSE WHAT BREAKS YOUR HEART

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:50.730
IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT BREAKS YOUR HEART.

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:53.130
FOR YOU, IT'S RACISM,

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:55.160
AND FOR YOU, IT'S HUNGER, AND FOR YOU, IT'S WAR,

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.860
AND FOR YOU, IT'S ANIMAL CRUELTY.

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.070
AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FIND THAT THING

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:01.600
THAT BREAKS YOUR HEART OPEN AND MAKES YOU --

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.740
MAKES IT HARD TO BREATHE,

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.610
AND YOU DON'T "EASY" BUTTON YOUR WAY OUT

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:07.840
BUT YOU LET IT BE YOUR PROFESSOR,

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.480
IT GUIDES YOU TOWARDS THE PEOPLE

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.910
WHO ARE DOING THAT WORLD-HEALING WORK

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:14.680
IN THE WORLD, RIGHT?

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.350
AND THERE YOU FIND YOUR PURPOSE,

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:19.920
AND THEN THE BONUS IS, THAT THERE YOU FIND YOUR TRIBE.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.390
BECAUSE THERE'S NO BOND GREATER THAN THE BOND THAT HAPPENS

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:28.160
BETWEEN PEOPLE DOING THE SAME WORLD-HEALING WORK TOGETHER.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.370
YOU GUYS AND GIRLS AND WOMEN,

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:33.530
IF WE STOPPED FEARING OUR PAIN,

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:36.740
WE WOULD HEAL OUR NATION, OKAY?

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:40.880
WE ARE IN A SWEATY-ASS YOGA CLASS RIGHT NOW...

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.510
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:47.810
...AND WE HAVE GOT TO COMMIT TO STAYING ON OUR MAT

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:49.350
BECAUSE EVERYTHING WE NEED

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:51.690
TO BECOME THE COUNTRY WE WERE MEANT TO BE,

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:54.750
TO BECOME GREAT FOR THE FIRST TIME

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:57.160
FOR ALL OF US, RIGHT,

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.390
IS INSIDE THE HOT LONELINESS

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:01.560
OF OUR COLLECTIVE PAIN RIGHT NOW.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.730
OKAY?

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.100
SO, I NEED TO TALK TO THE WHITE WOMEN

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.870
FOR A MINUTE, OKAY?

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.540
WE'RE GOING TO TALK, OKAY?

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.110
SO, I KNOW THAT MANY OF US

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:14.610
ARE FEELING ALONE AND IGNORED

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.140
AND THREATENED AND ABUSED,

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.380
AND WE'RE FEELING LIKE OUR BODIES ARE BEING THREATENED

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.080
AND THAT OUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION IS AT RISK

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.320
AND WE CAN BE GRABBED AT ANY MINUTE

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.590
AND OUR DEGRADATION

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:29.320
AND OUR OBJECTIFICATION AND OUR DISCRIMINATION

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.760
HAS BECOME NORMALIZED AND ACCEPTED

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.300
IN WAYS THAT ARE CHILLING.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.630
AND THIS IS PAINFUL.

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.100
BUT WHAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.370
IS THAT THIS IS JUST A TOUCH

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:41.970
OF THE PAIN THAT SO MANY

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:43.800
MARGINALIZED PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:48.270
HAVE BEEN FEELING FOR AGES, RIGHT?

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.110
FOR BLACK PEOPLE AND BROWN PEOPLE

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:51.110
AND TRANS PEOPLE

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:52.850
AND GAY PEOPLE AND MUSLIM PEOPLE

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:56.020
AND NATIVE AMERICANS AND POOR PEOPLE, RIGHT?

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.850
THIS IS JUST A TOUCH

00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.350
OF WHAT THEY'VE BEEN FEELING.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:01.720
AND WHAT SUCKS IS THAT IT TOOK US

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.060
BEING PERSONALLY AFFECTED TO FINALLY SHOW UP.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.190
RIGHT?

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:10.230
AND SO, WE CANNOT SHOW UP FOR THE MOVEMENT

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.330
AND SAY "HERE WE ARE" UNTIL WE SAY

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:15.400
"WE ARE SO DAMN SORRY IT TOOK US SO LONG."

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.870
RIGHT?

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:20.440
AND THEN, WHEN WE ARE SPEAKING AGAI--

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.840
WE BETTER NOT SPEAK AGAINST MISOGYNY

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.480
IF IN THE SAME BREATH WE'RE NOT ALSO SPEAKING

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:28.120
AGAINST TRANSPHOBIA AND HOMOPHOBIA

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.950
AND RACISM AND CLASSISM

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:32.890
AND POVERTY IN THE SAME BREATH

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.620
BECAUSE THIS IS ONE FIGHT. IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.120
AND SO, WHEN WOMEN SAY TO ME -- WHEN WHITE WOMEN SAY TO ME,

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.730
"HOW DO I LEAD? WHERE DO I BEGIN?"

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:43.560
I SAY, "YOU DO NOT LEAD, AND YOU DON'T BEGIN ANYTHING!"

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.600
THE FIGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS IS NOT NEW.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.130
WE'RE JUST NEW TO IT, RIGHT?

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.500
AND THE GENERALS OF JUSTICE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.410
AND WILL ALWAYS BE THE WOMEN OF COLOR, RIGHT?

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:56.610
SO, WHAT YOU DO IS,

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.110
YOU LEARN ABOUT SHIRLEY CHISHOLM

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:00.310
AND YOU LEARN ABOUT MAYA ANGELOU

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.350
AND YOU LEARN, AND YOU LEARN, AND YOU LEARN,

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:04.790
AND THEN YOU LEARN ABOUT AND FOLLOW AVA DUVERNAY

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:06.550
AND ALICIA GARZA

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:09.190
AND CARMEN PEREZ AND LINDA SARSOUR --

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:10.690
YOU LOOK AT HOW THEY'RE FIGHTING,

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:13.160
AND THEN YOU FIGHT LIKE THEY'RE FIGHTING. RIGHT?

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.930
BECAUSE IF OUR WHITE FEMINISM DOES NOT BECOME INTERSECTIONAL,

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:19.130
THEN IT WILL BE NOTHING.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:22.700
BUT THE BEAUTY OF THIS MOMENT,

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.470
YOU GUYS, IS THAT WE WERE ASLEEP AND SEPARATE,

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:28.440
AND NOW WE'RE AWAKE AND UNITED.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:32.910
AND OUR COLLECTIVE PAIN CAN BECOME OUR COLLECTIVE POWER.

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:34.550
IT ALREADY IS!

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:36.050
LOOK AROUND, LOOK AROUND,

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:40.790
HOW LUCKY WE ARE TO BE ALIVE RIGHT NOW!

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.190
OKAY.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:44.390
I'M ALMOST DONE. I'M EIGHT MINUTES OVER.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:47.800
SO!

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.100
LISTEN.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.530
THE JOURNEY OF THE LOVE WARRIOR

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.130
IS TO STOP HIDING FROM HER PAIN

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:54.240
AND INSTEAD TURN DIRECTLY TOWARDS IT,

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.740
RIGHT, AND MARCH RIGHT INTO IT.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.570
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO TRUST ME THAT THAT WORKS

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:00.710
BECAUSE EVERY GREAT SPIRITUAL LEADER

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:03.010
WHO HAS EVER GRACED OUR EARTH

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.310
HAS TAUGHT THE SAME THING --

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:07.550
THAT YOU NEED YOU PAIN, RIGHT?

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:09.150
WHETHER IT WAS BUDDHA, WHOSE FATHER TRIED

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.720
TO PROTECT HIM FROM ALL SUFFERING,

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.890
BUT HE HAD TO LEAVE AND EXPERIENCE ALL OF IT

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:15.890
BEFORE HE COULD FIND ENLIGHTENMENT.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:18.990
OR MY FAVORITE, JOAN OF ARC WHO, AT 14,

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:22.700
LED HER PEOPLE STRAIGHT INTO THE BATTLE

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:24.930
TO FIND VICTORY, RIGHT?

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.470
OR WESTLEY FROM "THE PRINCESS BRIDE,"

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:31.270
WHO SAID...

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:32.440
..."LIFE IS PAIN, HIGHNESS,

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.040
AND ANYONE WHO TELLS YOU DIFFERENTLY

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.810
IS SELLING YOU SOMETHING."

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:44.450
OR JESUS, YOU GUYS -- I, LIKE, WORSHIP THE GUY, OKAY.

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:46.020
AND THE NIGHT BEFORE THE CRUCIFIXION,

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.820
SO HE HAD LIKE THESE 12 FRIENDS

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.260
AND ONE OF THEM WAS LIKE REALLY SLOW, OKAY --

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.060
HIS NAME WAS PETER. I LIKE PETER.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.500
AND HE NEVER KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON,

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.360
BUT HE FINALLY FIGURED OUT THE NIGHT

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.770
BEFORE THE CRUCIFIXION WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:01.440
SO, HE GOES UP TO JESUS AND HE'S LIKE,

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.500
"DUDE, UM...

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.210
SO HERE'S WHAT I HEARD --

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:07.210
THEY'RE GOING TO KILL YOU TOMORROW.

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:10.180
YOU'RE GOD, SO EXNAY ON THE RUSIFIXIONKAY.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.880
I FEEL LIKE...

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.480
LET'S JUST RUN. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE," OKAY?

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.650
SO, BASICALLY PETER IS LIKE "EASY" BUTTON.

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:19.450
DENIAL, RIGHT? AND WHAT DID JESUS SAY?

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:22.960
HE SAID, "NO, GET BEHIND ME.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.830
THAT PAIN WAS MEANT FOR ME."

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.600
THERE IS NO GLORY

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.430
EXCEPT STRAIGHT THROUGH YOUR STORY.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.970
AND THERE IS NO RESURRECTION

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:38.070
WITHOUT THE CRUCIFIXION FIRST.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:41.710
ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS COME FROM TRYING TO RISE

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:45.610
BEFORE WE SURRENDER TO OUR OWN CRUCIFIXION.

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:47.210
FOR US, IN OUR PERSONAL LIVES,

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:49.650
FOR OUR RELATIONSHIPS, FOR OUR WORLD,

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:51.650
THE PATTERN IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:53.420
FIRST, THE PAIN,

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:56.190
THEN THE RISING.

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:58.260
FIRST OUR PAIN,

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.430
THEN OUR RISING.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.130
OKAY, I'M DONE. [ SIGHS ]
