00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:39.359
Top 10 Most Misunderstood Lines in Literary
History

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.579
10. Robert Frost, The Road Not Taken

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.050
Famous Quote: “I took the one less traveled
by, and that has made all the difference.”

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.440
The United States’ most famous poet’s
most famous poem is a timeless ode to the

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.969
American ideals of “individuality” and
“forging your own path.” It’s one of

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.440
those poems that’s so famous, even people
who hate poetry can quote it. These are the

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.660
reasons it appears on The Academy of American
Poets’ list of top poems for college graduation.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.040
Except aside from that last part, everything
we just said isn’t true. Frost is actually

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.570
using an old technique known as the “unreliable
narrator,” and he isn’t even being all

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.110
that subtle about it: in spite of the famous
quote’s insistence that one road is “less

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.160
traveled by,” the second stanza of the poem
clarifies that both roads are “worn… really

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.280
about the same.” Oh, and also, Frost himself
admitted that he was actually mocking the

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.380
idea that single decisions would change your
life, and specifically making fun of a friend

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.110
of his who had a tendency to over-think things
that really weren’t that big a deal.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.060
So what you thought was life-affirming was
really just another poet/hipster condescendingly

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.880
saying “you think you’re an individual,
when really you’re just a cog in the machine,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.880
man!”

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.240
9. William Shakespeare, Romeo &amp; Juliet

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.720
Famous Quote: “Star-Crossed Lovers”

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.060
Aww, Romeo &amp; Juliet: two teenagers in the
throes of what could possibly be the most

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.750
pure love in literary history. This is why
when a magazine wants to comment on, say,

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.400
Justin Bieber’s love life or the relationship
between a little boy and his horse, they’re

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.709
likely to reference the sonnet that opens
Shakespeare’s most famous play by calling

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.069
them “Star-Crossed Lovers.”

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.510
And sure, this is totally appropriate, if
you’re expecting these people to die. “Star-Crossed”

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.219
doesn’t mean “brought together by fate,”
it means “fated to die,” because the stars

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:27.709
(fate) have “crossed” you. Shakespeare
is intentionally reminding everyone at the

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.879
beginning of his play that this is a frickin’
tragedy, you guys, and you’re in for a miserable

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:33.879
ride.

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.439
8. Lewis Carrol, Alice in Wonderland

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:42.189
Famous Quote: “Oh, ’tis love, ’tis love
that makes the world go round.”

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:47.510
This is an amazingly misunderstood line from
an amazingly misunderstood writer. Pretty

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.519
much everything about the life of Lewis Carroll
(real name Charles Dodgson) is shrouded in

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.180
confusion and slander; rather than being about
drugs, Alice in Wonderland is most likely

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.889
a criticism of then-new forms of mathematics
that were becoming popular at Dodgson’s

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:06.980
own Oxford College. In addition, though he
was commonly accused of pedophilia, The Annotated

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.040
Alice and The Carroll Myth makes the argument
that Dodgson was actually asexual, and preferred

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.640
the company of children because he was extremely
uncomfortable with courting and any form of

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.860
sexual innuendo.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.550
Finally, and perhaps fittingly, his most famous
quote is the one here about love making the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.390
world go ’round, and it is directly contrary
to all of his pessimistic and strictly logical

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.209
real-world values. In context, this quote
is said by The Duchess, a character who is

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.900
introduced as a potential child murderer.
Hardly the kind of character a writer would

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.200
want to speak the moral of his story.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.939
Finally, need we remind you that Dodgson was
a mathematician? Almost every detail of his

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:50.090
biography — as well as the actual context
of this story — show that this idea of love

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.739
as a geo-revolutionary repellant is supposed
to be scoffed at, not adored.

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.349
So it’s true that you might believe this
to be true, but if that’s the case then

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.079
it’s also true that one of history’s greatest
writers is making fun of you.

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.269
7. William Shakespeare, Hamlet

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.590
Famous Quote: “This above all: to thine
own self be true.”

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.669
No, this is not the last time Shakespeare
is appearing on this list. You can probably

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:20.829
guess why this line has become popular: it’s
a simple platitude, and it’s attractive

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.740
because it deals with individuality (just
like the Frost example). However, if you look

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.020
at who’s saying it and really analyze the
content of the play, it becomes quickly obvious

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.280
that Willy Shakes is making fun of this whole
concept.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.919
As anyone who’s read Shakespeare knows,
the English language has evolved quite a bit

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.660
since these plays were first performed, and
what now seems like new-agey self-acceptance

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.310
actually meant something quite different in
Elizabethan times: Polonius is telling his

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.930
son to work for himself, and only for himself,
and to put everyone else he encounters second.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.190
He’s not encouraging individuality, he’s
encouraging selfishness.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.970
Furthermore, Polonius spends the whole play
being a complete nitwit, and even Wikipedia’s

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.560
basic description of him includes pointing
out that he is “wrong in all the judgments

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.930
that he makes during the play.” In most
versions, Laertes (Polonius’s son,and the

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.620
character he’s talking to) isn’t even
listening — lots of stage directors will

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.180
have the character roll his eyes and scamper
off quickly to avoid the avalanche of clichés

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.960
his father is dumping on him.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.750
So what sounds like the kind of cutesy nonsense
you’d roll your eyes at is really just bad

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.569
advice given by a dumb character to someone
who isn’t even listening.

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:36.139
6. John Keats, Ode to a Grecian Urn

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.830
Famous Quote: “Beauty is truth, truth beauty.”

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.580
Of all the examples on this list, this is
probably the most likely to be misunderstood.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.039
After all, whether or not Keats was being
serious when he said that, beauty = truth

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:55.350
is basically the Kirk v Picard of classic
English Literature. Unlike that controversy,

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.699
there has actually emerged a begrudging consensus,
and that is “that Keats did not, in fact,

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:02.479
believe that beauty is truth.”

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:06.949
The controversy boils down to whether Keats
thought art was a) supposed to represent the

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:11.379
real world, or b) was better than the real
world, with most scholars eventually deciding

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:15.629
that Keats believed the latter. Not only does
this cast a strange shadow over the rest of

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:19.860
Keats’ work, which is described here as
being “way over on the idealistic side of

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.830
the sliding scale of idealism versus cynicism,”
but it’s also just kinda fun and quirky

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.600
that the most stereotypically pretentious
comment in English Literary History was actually

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.659
a sarcastic quip.

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:35.419
5. William Shakespeare, Romeo &amp; Juliet

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:38.909
Famous Quote: “Wherefore art thou, Romeo?”

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:43.750
“Wherefore” means “why,” as in, “why
is your name Romeo?” The central conflict

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.950
of the play is that R &amp; J can’t be together
because they are members of feuding families.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.479
Juliet isn’t asking where Romeo is — that’d
be stupid. He’s standing right in front

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:54.479
of her.

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:57.160
Also, we told you Shakespeare would show up
on this list again.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.360
4. Rudyard Kipling, The Ballad of East and
West

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:07.509
Famous Quote: “Oh East is East and West
is West and never the twain shall meet.”

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:11.639
It’s usually just the last couple lines
here that are quoted, usually to describe

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:16.310
two things that, you know, won’t ever meet.
Memorable instances are from Raising Arizona

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.660
(“There’s what’s right and there’s
what’s right and never the twain shall meet,”)

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:25.289
and the first episode of Secret Diary of a
Call Girl, if anyone cares at all about that.

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:29.250
The problem is that Kipling isn’t just being
sarcastic here — it’s blatantly obvious

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:33.669
that within the context of the poem this is
just a straw man argument, and only stated

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:37.780
at all so he can immediately point out why
that statement doesn’t apply.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:42.280
“Oh, East is East and West is West, and
never the twain shall meet,

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:47.090
Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God’s
great judgment Seat;

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.470
But there is neither East nor West, Border,
nor Breed, nor Birth,

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:57.479
When two strong men stand face to face, though
they come from the ends of the earth!”

00:07:57.479 --> 00:08:02.419
In addition to having some confusions about
how capitalization works (silly nineteenth

00:08:02.419 --> 00:08:06.940
century, amirite?), Kipling is taking the
blatant stance that colonialism pretty much

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:12.520
rules and East and West are going to meet
pretty hard despite all that physics stuff.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.340
3. Robert Frost, Mending Wall

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.090
Famous Quote: “Good fences make good neighbors.”

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:23.660
Hey Robby Frost, good to see you on this list
again. Privacy is the theme this time, and

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.849
while the phrase “good fences make good
neighbors” is not quite so famous as some

00:08:27.849 --> 00:08:32.090
others (though you’ve certainly heard it),
Mending Wall gets launched up to number 3

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:37.159
on this list for one simple reason: it’s
misunderstood by federal law.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:42.130
“Separation of powers, a distinctively American
political doctrine, profits from the advice

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:46.920
authored by a distinctively American poet:
Good fences make good neighbors.”

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:52.890
That’s United States Supreme Court Justice
Antonin Scalia, literally creating hard law

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.690
from thin air, and not understanding the thing
he’s talking about.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:00.000
Mending Wall does include the line “good
fences make good neighbors,” but it also

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.990
paints the character speaking that line as
a bit of a twit. “Something there is that

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.630
doesn’t love a wall… (nature) sends the
frozen groundswell under it.” The poem tells

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:12.639
a story of two neighbors with a wall between
them, but every winter the wall falls apart,

00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:16.190
so the neighbors have to meet and mend the
wall, spending more time together than they

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:20.250
otherwise would have and growing increasingly
frustrated with the each other.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.400
Remember that the Supreme Court has nine justices,
and at least one (Stephen Breyer) actually

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.279
pointed out the error in his concurring opinion,
but Scalia decided to leave the mistake in

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:30.389
anyway.

00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:34.839
2. Friedrich Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zarathustra

00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:39.610
Famous Quote: …at the bottom of all these
noble races the beast of prey, the splendid

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:43.920
blond beast, prowling about avidly in search
of spoil and victory…”

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.450
We’re not going to put the whole quote up
there because Nietzsche was a philosopher

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:51.240
and therefore pretty longwinded, but we’ve
highlighted the important parts. Or rather,

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.910
we’ve highlighted the parts that the Nazis
thought were important, when they were all

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:59.399
Nazi-ing around and committing the first ever
industrialized genocide, trying to live up

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:02.350
to the standards that Nietzsche, apparently,
set for them.

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:06.910
The problem is that’s not what Nietzsche
meant at all. The original quote ends like

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:12.440
this: “the Roman, Arabian, Germanic, Japanese
nobility, the Homeric heroes, the Scandinavian

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:17.690
Vikings — they all shared this need.”
Everyone’s a blond beast because blond beasts

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.320
are a metaphor for lions.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.920
So if you’re going to use a philosopher
as the backbone of your political movement,

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.449
you might want to make sure you finish reading
his sentence before you get the war machine

00:10:28.449 --> 00:10:33.300
up and running. Also, the fact that you thought
he was advocating genocide was probably a

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.290
pretty good hint that you shouldn’t have
been listening to him anyway.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:37.899
You stupid Nazis.

00:10:37.899 --> 00:10:41.570
1. William Shakespeare, Sonnet 18

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:45.529
Famous Quote: “Shall I compare thee to a
summer’s day?”

00:10:45.529 --> 00:10:49.540
This is definitely the most quoted line in
all of English literature, so much so that

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.440
you’ve probably seen it as a parody more
often that you’ve seen it written out straight

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.600
— for example, “Shall I compare thee to
a bale of hay.” It’s one of the few poems

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:03.639
that is just so cliché that, if a guy recited
it to his girlfriend on a date, even the most

00:11:03.639 --> 00:11:06.740
love-sick of recipients would roll their eyes
in disgust.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.529
But when Shakespeare’s talking about “love,”
he’s not talking about romantic love or

00:11:10.529 --> 00:11:15.770
feminine beauty– the first 126 sonnets in
Shakespeare’s work are generally understood

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:20.920
to be addressed towards a man, and many of
the surrounding pieces are actually encouraging

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.550
procreation. Shakespeare isn’t wooing a
beautiful woman; he’s telling a wealthy

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:29.140
young ponz exactly what he wants to hear:
that he’s just so damn sexy that it’d

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.690
be pretty much the worst thing in the world
if he didn’t have kids.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:36.279
So if you’re a lady reading this, if any
guy offers to compare you to a summer’s

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:41.170
day, say “no, ’cause I’m not a dude.”
If you’re a guy, don’t offer to compare

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.589
your lady to a summer’s day. If you’re
a man whose wife is trying to convince you

00:11:44.589 --> 00:12:06.140
that it’s time to have kids then…uh, that’s
actually fine. Nicely done.
