00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.520
It's Lee.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.960
Ha-ha!

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.840
I was genuinely invited to Harry
and Meghan's wedding today,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.120
but I said no, because
I had to come here and do this.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.120
David's team.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.720
Why were you invited?

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.400
Well, that, David,
is as much of a shock to me

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.840
as it is to you. I'm on the telly.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.440
Do you know, for example,
Prince Harry?

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.320
Or Meghan Markle? Well...

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.400
I've met Prince Harry
and he was very nice and he did say

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.640
that he was a fan of this show.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.640
So he's definitely seen me,
because I'm on this show.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.160
If this is true,
it's a bit of a blow to me

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.680
and Rob, because...
Well, this is...

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.480
Well, I wasn't invited.
Maybe Rob was as well...

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.840
I really can't say.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.120
I think we know if Rob was invited,
he would be able to say.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.600
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.360
Well, this is interesting,
because I want to know

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.840
if you were invited,
because as soon as I got the invite,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.040
I've met Prince Harry and I know
he's a fan of the show

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.880
so I immediately assumed that you
two had been invited as well.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.440
So I went to phone you, and I phoned
you first and I put the phone down.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.920
Because I didn't want to ask in
case you hadn't been invited.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.520
I thought it wouldn't
be a good idea...

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.400
It would be a horrible thing
to let slip, wouldn't it? Yes.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.680
It would be a horrible thing to do
to someone under any circumstances,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.280
even if it wasn't in public.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.440
So you think he's going, "OK,
George Clooney, David Beckham,

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.920
"Oprah Winfrey, Lee."

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.480
They didn't even know my surname!

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.360
I should point out to people
watching at home that it is

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.720
the Royal Wedding day today.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.680
As we record this,
it happened today, didn't it?

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.400
And it was a lovely wedding as well.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.040
It brought people
together, didn't it?

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.920
And you know what I'm glad about?
I'm glad he wasn't there.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.680
Yes. That would have spoiled it for
me.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.640
Oh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.920
Did it come through the post?

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.280
It went through my agent.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.560
So it's more like a booking.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.360
Were they expecting you to do some
of your silly humour or something?

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.360
Did you have a plus one as well?
Yes, I did.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.320
And so your wife was happy
for you to come and do this instead

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.880
of going to the Royal Wedding?

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.360
Well, actually, my wife...
My wife couldn't go anyway.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.480
So that was the other
problem as well.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.480
And then I thought,
well, "Who would I take?"

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.640
And I did actually think of

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.360
one of you two, and I thought,
"That's going to be more awkward."

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.600
So... But then I thought, "Maybe
it's not awkward if David's

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.960
"been invited," as I suspected,
"and Rob hasn't. I'll take Rob."

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.240
Then we're all going.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.920
There was a lot of social etiquette,
I was all... I was a mess.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.720
That is the other question,
why didn't...

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.120
Because the wedding finished...

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.000
This is the irritating thing.
..at about one.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.400
Yes. And then there was a lunch.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.640
I got the invite that said
the wedding is going

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.920
to be at 12 o'clock.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.640
And I thought, in my head,
no-one would say 12 o'clock meaning

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.040
that's when the wedding is.
That would mean, you know,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.600
you turn up at 12 o'clock and then
you go through all the rigmarole

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.040
of security, blah-blah-blah.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.160
And, actually, the wedding
will be at about two.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.720
Then you've got the actual ceremony,
then you've got the meal,

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.920
I wasn't going to get here...

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.880
It's like when you buy
theatre tickets, the time

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.760
is just when they think
you should leave home.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.480
Lads, I appreciate you're angry.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.240
Yeah. Very angry.
I did... I don't...

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.920
I didn't write the invites.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.960
Very angry and very hurt
and very bruised,

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.120
whether this is true or not.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.560
That's the terrible thing,
because my thought processes

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.760
have gone down the lines
of it being true, and it feels

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.360
like I've been through it
emotionally, even if I haven't.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.480
OK, time to decide. OK, well...

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.160
I mean, I think it's...

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.280
I'd love it to be true,
but I think it's unlikely.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.080
I wouldn't. This has been...

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.040
This has been one of the most
psychologically damaging thought

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.320
experiments I've ever gone through.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.280
And, so, I couldn't...

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.920
I don't think I could pronounce
the words "I think this is true."

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.160
Oh, I just did...

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.360
You think it's true?

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.440
Are we going to say lie?
I think lie.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.120
Lie, we're going to say lie.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.720
I've a horrible feeling
in the pit of my stomach...

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.400
that it's true.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.920
It's like waiting with a
specialist for a result.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.480
Yeah.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.720
Ironically, if this is true,
when that moment comes for both

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.800
of us, it'll just be a mercy.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.600
APPLAUSE

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.200
So, Lee, tell us.
They think it's a lie.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.560
I pray it's a lie.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.920
It is in fact...

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.280
true.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.240
AUDIENCE GASPS

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.560
Terrible.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.120
Well, I hope that's the last
question of the evening.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.920
How did you keep that a secret?
Thank you for watching...

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.200
That's it.
I mean, thank you for watching.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.360
Oh, actually, there's something
else as well.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.040
Sorry, I've got to tell you this as
well, which is quite important.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.040
This is a true story as well.
I was lying.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.200
GASPING AND APPLAUSE

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.400
Look at the smile
on his little face!

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.040
Look at the little happy face!

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.360
You're OK, it's all right,
all right.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.760
Yes, praise be, it was a lie!

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.480
Of course it was a lie.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.880
Lee wasn't invited,
of course he wasn't,

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.880
to Harry and Meghan's wedding.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.440
Do you know what I think?
I think the producers of this show

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.480
are just trying to turn us against
each other.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.720
They're doing a good job!

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.160
BUZZER
