00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.270
Consider the ingredients in the following
low carb high fat recipe.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.780
“Two pounds of de-boned white fish, one-half
cup butter and two-thirds pint or more of

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.660
cream, two tablespoon of flour, the juice
of one half lemon, salt and pepper to taste.”

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.300
Excluding the fish and lemon, this recipe’s
saturated-fat-packed dairy to carbohydrate

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.039
ratio is 19:1.

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.210
Low carb or ketogenic cookbooks with recipes
like this may sound like a delicious way to

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.600
lose weight, but what about cholesterol and
heart disease?

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.380
What’s interesting about this saturated
fat heavy recipe is that it isn’t recent

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.380
at all.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.020
It came from an 1895 cookbook, a time when
heart disease rates were at an all time low.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.620
Almost every single recipe in The Baptist
Ladies’ Cook Book contains butter, eggs,

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.130
cream or lard.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.530
And, if you rewind to ninety nine years earlier
in 1796 when “The First American Cookbook”

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.440
came out, you find plenty of recipes using
plenty of lard and fat pork, and a majority

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.420
of the recipes call for butter, usually by
the pound or half pound.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.710
Before 1910, people in the United States almost
exclusively used saturated fat heavy butter

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.580
and animal fats for cooking and baking.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.030
At the time, cooking with vegetable oils was
almost unheard of.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.880
But as the process of hulling and pressing
seeds and beans was mechanized, vegetable

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.090
oils became cheaper than butter or animal
fat.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.731
From 1909 to 1999, consumption of soybean
oil in the United States increased by more

00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:38.280
than 1,000-fold per person, margarine consumption
increased 12-fold, but consumption of butter

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.310
and lard decreased by about four-fold each.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.201
Sometime after 1910, there was concern about
the growing rates of heart disease, and president

00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:52.210
Eisenhower’s heart attack in 1955 really
got the ball rolling on figuring out what

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.640
causes heart disease.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.799
There were a couple places to look: for example,
smoking rates were on the rise along with

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.920
the rise of heart disease:

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.700
President Eisenhower by the way, had been
a four-pack-a-day chainsmoker a couple years

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.850
before his heart attack.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.590
Despite this, and the fact that the president’s
attack occurred right in the middle of the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.590
rapid decline of animal fat consumption and
rapid rise of vegetable oil consumption, saturated

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.670
fat took the blame.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.069
You probably know the rest: it was found that
cholesterol is contained in the plaques that

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.800
clog arteries, and saturated fat increases
your cholesterol.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.830
Thus, “artery clogging saturated fat”
became a common phrase.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.500
But before we get into whether having high
cholesterol from eating too much saturated

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.319
fat causes heart disease, let’s look at
cholesterol itself.

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.000
What is it for?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.840
Well, first off, it’s very important for
maintaining the integrity of cells in your

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.840
body.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.910
Without it, your cells would turn to mush.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.890
A huge function of cholesterol is making and
metabolizing hormones.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.930
Hence, cholesterol levels naturally rise throughout
pregnancy, a time in which the body is producing

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.110
all sorts of hormones to manufacture a fresh
human.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.420
A 1997 study of university students found
that cholesterol levels rose “proportional

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.000
to the degree of examination stress.”

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.150
When the body is under stress, it produces
cholesterol to make hormones that help deal

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.180
with the stress.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.950
If you are awakened by a burglar trying to
break into your home at 4AM, but have a checkup

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.520
later in the day, you can expect your cholesterol
levels to be sky high and for your doctor

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.129
to prescribe you a statin - a cholesterol
lowering drug.

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:35.220
Cholesterol’s importance in hormone production
also explains why men taking statins have

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.140
been found to have lower testosterone.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.590
So, I hope we can agree that we need some
cholesterol.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.959
But just how good is less cholesterol?

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:50.870
A 2001 paper documents the changes in 3572
elderly people’s serum cholesterol concentrations

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.819
over 20 years, and compared them with rates
of death.

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:00.099
They found that the group with the lowest
cholesterol had the lowest rate of survival.

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:01.260
The author’s interpretation?

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.860
“We have been unable to explain our results”

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.810
You may have heard of the “French Paradox”
- a term coined in the late 1980’s that

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.590
refers to the particularly low obesity and
heart disease rate in France despite people

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.939
getting as much as 40% of their energy intake
from fat with 16% of it being saturated fat

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:26.289
- this is three times the amount of Saturated
Fat the American Heart Association recommends.

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:30.979
One theory is that red wine is what allows
French people to eat so much butter, cheese,

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.129
cream, foie gras, and pate yet stay so healthy.

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:40.370
So maybe if French people lowered their dietary
saturated fat and therefore cholesterol and

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.689
drank the wine, they’d be even healthier.

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:48.000
Well, a 1989 paper tracking the mortality
rates of 92 elderly women in a nursing home

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.629
in Paris found that rate of death was 5.2
times higher in those with the lowest cholesterol.

00:04:55.629 --> 00:05:00.509
But we know total cholesterol is somewhat
outdated, and now the concern is about LDL

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:03.449
- the so called “bad” cholesterol.

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:08.280
As shown in a review written by multiple doctors
in departments like Cell Biology, Chemistry,

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.490
Endocrinology and Nutrition science, compared
to other diets, when you go on a low carbohydrate

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:19.590
diet, many biomarkers improve: your weight
goes down, your hemoglobin A1c goes down,

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.449
glucose is down, triglycerides are way down,
but this small increase in LDL may have some

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.229
people worrying.

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:33.360
In this talk by Peter Attia, he explains:
"We were taught that LDL cholesterol is the

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.479
big risk, right?

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.629
If your LDL cholesterol is high, you are at
risk for heart disease.

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:46.909
This is a study that looked at 136,000 patients
admitted to the hospital for a coronary artery

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:52.289
event and in these patients they looked at
LDL cholesterol level and you can see that

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:58.470
nearly 50% of them had what you would consider
a low LDL cholesterol level."

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.339
Many scientists believe oxidized cholesterol
to be the real problem as it initiates the

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:06.940
process leading to the buildup of plaque in
the arteries.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.060
So then, how does it become oxidized?

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.759
One way is, ironically, through the effects
of consuming so called “heart healthy”

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:16.659
vegetable oils.

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:20.749
The problem with the polyunsaturated fatty
acids in vegetable oils is that because of

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:22.819
their structure, they are unstable.

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:28.819
Meaning, when exposed to oxygen or heat, they
can form toxic byproducts and free radicals.

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:34.129
Free radicals which can oxidize cholesterol
and thus lead to heart disease.

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:39.639
So when you heat vegetable oils, free radicals
as well as small lipid fragments called aldehydes

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.460
can form.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.169
Aldehydes are well known to be toxic.

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:50.169
A hangover is suspected to be the result of
alcohol being metabolized into acetaldehyde.

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:54.430
Research by Martin Grootveld, a professor
of bioanalytical chemistry and chemical pathology,

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:59.240
showed that “a typical meal of fish and
chips”, fried in vegetable oil, contained

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:06.240
as much as 100 to 200 times more toxic aldehydes
than the WHO safe daily limit.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:12.969
In contrast, frying butter, olive oil, coconut
oil and lardproduced far lower levels of aldehydes.

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:17.409
Maybe McDonald’s ought to switch back to
making their fries in beef tallow, as they

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:18.889
did before the early 90’s.

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:23.310
"And I thought when they first started out
the french fries were very good.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:30.770
And then the nutritionists got at them and
it turned out to be erroneous that beef, tallow,

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.369
fat was bad and..."

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:37.250
But, vegetable oils, for example corn oil,
do an excellent job of lowering cholesterol.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.479
We’ve known this since the 1960’s.

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:43.259
Here’s Dr. David Diamond explaining a study
on this from 1965: "They had one group that

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:49.209
was put on a low cholesterol, low fat diet
and they had a couple tablespoons of corn

00:07:49.209 --> 00:07:50.209
oil per day.

00:07:50.209 --> 00:07:55.089
The other group as you see here, it says no
advice was given to the control patients.

00:07:55.089 --> 00:07:59.110
And the outcome was quite nice as far as the
cholesterol.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:03.469
So the study was a success as far as reducing
cholestero.

00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:04.939
But then, when you look at the outcome.

00:08:04.939 --> 00:08:06.340
The outcome is very straightforward.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.479
To stay in the study you have to stay alive.

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:12.219
So now when you look at these two groups and
look at whose still in the study.

00:08:12.219 --> 00:08:18.219
And so, the people on the low fat low cholesterol
corn oil diet, only half of them were left.

00:08:18.219 --> 00:08:24.659
So twice as many people had heart attacks
and died in those that had the corn oil."

00:08:24.659 --> 00:08:29.710
Another tragic consequence of replacing saturated
fats with polyunsaturated vegetable oils is

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:35.720
losing out on the heart protective effects
of the fat soluble Vitamin K2 found in animal

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.030
fats.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:41.840
The importance of vitamin K2 in heart health
is shown by research on vitamin K2-dependent

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.190
reactions.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:47.670
For example, gamma carboxylation, requires
vitamin K as a cofactor.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:53.590
And, if the glutamic acid residues of gla-containing
proteins are not carboxylated, calcium cannot

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:54.870
be properly bound.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:09:00.020
You don’t need to remember all that, but
it simply means that Vitamin K2 is necessary

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:04.500
to take the calcium out of your heart and
put it into your bones.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.320
Calcium deposition in the vascular system
is a consistent feature of heart disease.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:15.500
Interestingly, as this 2004 paper shows, vitamin
K2 intake reduced mortality rates from heart

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:22.280
disease and all causes, but vitamin K1 (found
in soybean and canola oil) did not.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:26.270
And, more recently we’re seeing articles
like this:

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:31.970
Let’s take a brief moment to review how
our eating patterns have changed following

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.310
dietary recommendations.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:39.620
Less Whole Milk, More Skim Milk, A little
less butter, Way more polyunsaturated oils,

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.320
Less eggs and Beef, and More lean Chicken
and Turkey.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.330
Top it all off with a gigantic increase in
sweet syrup.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.900
You might still be wondering, “if it’s
not the cholesterol, then what causes heart

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:51.900
disease?”

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:57.900
Let’s take a look at a study of patients
that have a condition called “familial hypercholesterolaemia”

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.430
that causes them to have abnormally high cholesterol.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:05.390
We’re supposed to keep our LDL below 100
to be healthy, but in these people, it was

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:06.420
nearing 250.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.810
But, a portion of them had heart disease and
the others did not.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.930
There’s no significant difference between
total cholesterol, or the so called good or

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:17.570
bad cholesterols.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.250
So what was different?

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:21.810
Clotting factors.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:26.560
Those diagnosed with heart disease had significantly
greater baseline clotting factors.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.390
Here’s a study showing that Cardiovascular
disease clearly increases with an increase

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.090
in the clotting factor fibrinogen.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:38.310
As Dr. David Diamond Points out: if we take
a look at the primary risk factors for heart

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:45.300
disease: Obesity, Diabetes, High Blood Sugar,
Smoking, Aging, Inflammation, Stress and Hypertension,

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.370
these are all linked to platelet activation
and clotting.

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:53.270
The point I want to make is that at the very
least, there are much better places to look

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:57.050
than cholesterol in trying to prevent heart
disease.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:01.300
For example, Dr. Mann Kummerow suspected trans-fats
to be the problem.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:06.530
Among other unhealthy effects, trans fats
inhibit Vitamin K2 dependent processes, promoting

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.200
calcium build up in the heart.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.740
Biochemist and two time Nobel Prize Winner
Linus Pauling suspected Vitamin C deficiency

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.400
to play a role as low Vitamin C stimulates
the production of the heart disease promoting

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.340
Lipoprotein (a).

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.570
Another big suspect is chronic inflammation

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:28.740
There are many factors that play into this
very complex condition, and more and more

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:33.630
data is showing that saturated fat in the
context of a low carbohydrate diet is not

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.520
one of them.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.700
Despite some data like this on 1998 Europe
suggesting that more saturated fat results

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:45.640
in less heart disease, the theory that saturated
fat causes heart disease has prevailed for

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:53.990
quite a while and radically changed the way
we eat.
