Reviewer: Nadine Hennig

00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:09.277
Ladies and gentleman, I see dead people.

00:00:09.282 --> 00:00:10.498
What may be a punch line

00:00:10.506 --> 00:00:13.430
from the film, the movie,
"The Sixth Sense" for you,

00:00:13.431 --> 00:00:15.830
is dire reality for me.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.820
As an emergency physician,

00:00:17.824 --> 00:00:20.531
I took care of thousands of people

00:00:20.537 --> 00:00:23.746
when they approached the line
between life and death.

00:00:24.397 --> 00:00:26.813
Many I could rescue from dying,

00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.613
many I could bring back,

00:00:28.613 --> 00:00:32.006
but I stood next to more than 2,000 humans

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:35.398
when they finally crossed the line
between life and death,

00:00:35.828 --> 00:00:37.229
and died.

00:00:37.513 --> 00:00:39.783
What I would like to do with you today

00:00:39.783 --> 00:00:41.662
is I walk with you the path

00:00:41.662 --> 00:00:43.923
from perfect well being in life

00:00:43.923 --> 00:00:45.589
till death.

00:00:45.594 --> 00:00:49.196
And then we try to look
a little bit beyond death.

00:00:49.196 --> 00:00:52.432
Don't be scared,
I'll be with you all the time.

00:00:52.432 --> 00:00:53.802
(Laughter)

00:00:53.802 --> 00:00:58.703
I promise you I will bring you
safely back to life.

00:00:58.703 --> 00:01:00.753
There are many illnesses
and many injuries,

00:01:00.753 --> 00:01:04.143
but, actually, there are
just four ways to die,

00:01:04.143 --> 00:01:07.182
just four ways to leave this planet.

00:01:07.182 --> 00:01:09.084
What you see [are some little] lines,

00:01:09.084 --> 00:01:11.783
[these little lines]
on the [right-hand] side

00:01:11.783 --> 00:01:14.293
are the activity level.

00:01:14.293 --> 00:01:17.014
This is a perfectly normal activity level.

00:01:17.014 --> 00:01:19.814
This person is alive and kicking.

00:01:19.814 --> 00:01:22.374
And then an injury or illness sets in,

00:01:22.385 --> 00:01:25.851
and this person suddenly dies
from one minute to the other.

00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:30.524
This may happen with a heart attack,
and this may happen with a car crash.

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:32.165
The second way of dying is:

00:01:32.178 --> 00:01:34.667
Someone is perfectly healthy again,

00:01:34.702 --> 00:01:37.730
and then a real bad illness sets in,

00:01:37.893 --> 00:01:42.931
and the health condition of this person
rapidly and constantly deteriorates.

00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:46.384
This is the case
with fast progressing tumours,

00:01:46.384 --> 00:01:49.455
for example, with leukaemia,
with lung cancer,

00:01:49.455 --> 00:01:51.492
or with pancreatic cancer.

00:01:51.508 --> 00:01:53.773
The third way of dying is:

00:01:53.777 --> 00:01:56.253
A person is once again perfectly healthy,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.938
and then another illness sets in,
and the health deteriorates.

00:02:00.943 --> 00:02:02.664
Then our therapy starts,

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.858
and we get this person
a little bit better,

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:08.235
but not to the baseline
this person had before.

00:02:08.235 --> 00:02:12.246
And then the illness gets stronger again,
and the health deteriorates.

00:02:12.246 --> 00:02:17.114
Once again we try
to help this person, to treat him,

00:02:17.114 --> 00:02:19.116
and he gets a little bit better,

00:02:19.116 --> 00:02:21.995
but once again
he will not reach his baseline,

00:02:21.995 --> 00:02:25.406
not even the baseline he had
before the last deterioration.

00:02:25.406 --> 00:02:29.376
And so the circle repeats,
and this person approaches death.

00:02:29.376 --> 00:02:32.361
This is the case, for example,
with heart failure.

00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:34.375
This is the case with liver disease,

00:02:34.375 --> 00:02:36.124
or with kidney diseases,

00:02:36.124 --> 00:02:38.814
and some, quite many, tumours.

00:02:38.814 --> 00:02:40.895
The fourth way of dying is different.

00:02:40.895 --> 00:02:43.524
The activity level is very low.

00:02:43.524 --> 00:02:46.845
This may mean
that this person is immobile,

00:02:46.845 --> 00:02:49.567
is bedridden, is in a nursing home,

00:02:49.567 --> 00:02:51.539
may be incontinent,

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.935
and probably suffers from dementia.

00:02:54.206 --> 00:02:58.739
This person slowly, slowly,
slowly progresses towards death.

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.237
Now, let's have a look.

00:03:01.395 --> 00:03:03.920
When you proceed
a little bit closer to death,

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:05.998
what are the signs and symptoms

00:03:06.025 --> 00:03:09.060
of those people
who will die within two days?

00:03:09.073 --> 00:03:11.103
There is scientific evidence for that.

00:03:11.406 --> 00:03:15.483
And you see those signs
which appear two days before death

00:03:15.483 --> 00:03:17.261
are very unspecific.

00:03:17.272 --> 00:03:20.557
At present, we cannot predict correctly

00:03:20.563 --> 00:03:23.286
which person will die
within the next two days,

00:03:23.297 --> 00:03:25.001
or not, so will recover.

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:27.041
We probably can in the future.

00:03:27.046 --> 00:03:28.581
We can do this,

00:03:28.584 --> 00:03:31.614
not by one single symptom,
but by a set of symptoms,

00:03:31.622 --> 00:03:33.352
or even by a lab test.

00:03:34.402 --> 00:03:38.751
And I leave it up to you
whether this is desirable or not.

00:03:39.816 --> 00:03:41.931
What are the signs and symptoms

00:03:41.941 --> 00:03:48.652
of those people who, allegedly,
die suddenly two hours before their death?

00:03:48.908 --> 00:03:54.179
75% of all those
who allegedly die suddenly

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:57.188
show signs and symptoms
before their death.

00:03:57.188 --> 00:04:00.758
Only 25% of those who die suddenly

00:04:00.758 --> 00:04:04.047
do not show signs
and symptoms before their death.

00:04:04.047 --> 00:04:06.958
So that means that,
at the present once again,

00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:11.448
we cannot predict who will die
within the next two hours or not.

00:04:11.457 --> 00:04:13.098
Those are the ways to die.

00:04:13.108 --> 00:04:17.188
Let's make a short survey,
let's make an opinion poll here.

00:04:17.204 --> 00:04:19.017
I would like to see your hands.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:23.700
Who of you would like
to die No.1, way No.1?

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.948
I'm not surprised, I quite often see that.

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:30.559
Who of you would like to die way No.4?

00:04:31.626 --> 00:04:33.573
Not so many.

00:04:33.587 --> 00:04:40.478
Now, problem is,
by far most people die this way,

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.242
by far.

00:04:42.246 --> 00:04:48.570
The most rapidly progressing
kind of way to die is No.4.

00:04:49.515 --> 00:04:54.482
Not even 10% of us will die No.1.

00:04:54.991 --> 00:04:59.019
Not even 10% of us will die No.1.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:07.054
So, how we would like to die,
and how we will die, is very different.

00:05:08.071 --> 00:05:12.643
We all have different genders,
we have different ages,

00:05:12.658 --> 00:05:17.202
we have different personalities,
and we have different lives.

00:05:17.215 --> 00:05:22.208
There is only one thing
we all have in common:

00:05:22.208 --> 00:05:23.950
we will die.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:29.416
For everyone of us, the moment will come
when our heart stops beating,

00:05:29.416 --> 00:05:34.549
when our lungs stop breathing,
when our brain activity ceases.

00:05:34.558 --> 00:05:36.453
We are now dead.

00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:44.110
Can we look what's happening
to us beyond death?

00:05:44.357 --> 00:05:50.429
Can we have a glance what happens to us,
what we will experience,

00:05:50.701 --> 00:05:53.341
shortly after we have died?

00:05:53.732 --> 00:05:55.258
Actually we can.

00:05:55.267 --> 00:05:57.267
We can look beyond death,

00:05:57.572 --> 00:06:01.972
because, of all those people
we bring back successfully,

00:06:01.972 --> 00:06:03.652
we resuscitate successfully,

00:06:03.664 --> 00:06:05.874
20% in the Western countries,

00:06:05.882 --> 00:06:09.309
and more than 30%
in the Eastern countries,

00:06:09.317 --> 00:06:15.242
report something to us
which we call near-death experiences.

00:06:15.242 --> 00:06:19.653
Those near-death experiences
are reported all over the world,

00:06:19.678 --> 00:06:23.602
and those reports
show striking similarities,

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:25.655
and reveal a pattern.

00:06:26.045 --> 00:06:29.370
This means death sets in,

00:06:29.986 --> 00:06:33.206
and those people who have
a near-death experience,

00:06:33.217 --> 00:06:34.744
the first phase is:

00:06:34.756 --> 00:06:36.756
There is a sudden change.

00:06:37.065 --> 00:06:39.377
And from one instant to the other,

00:06:39.386 --> 00:06:43.456
all pain is gone, all anxiety is gone,

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.849
all fear is gone, all noises are gone.

00:06:48.304 --> 00:06:53.342
There's just peace,
calmness and tranquillity.

00:06:54.154 --> 00:06:56.028
Some report joy.

00:06:57.492 --> 00:07:02.268
Quite a number report
something startling: there's an insight.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.282
The insight, I am dead now.

00:07:05.805 --> 00:07:08.152
This is what we call death.

00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:12.214
This insight is there without any anxiety.

00:07:12.874 --> 00:07:15.202
The second phase
of the near-death experiences

00:07:15.202 --> 00:07:17.813
is again a sudden change,

00:07:17.825 --> 00:07:22.176
and those people report
that they're floating above themselves.

00:07:22.184 --> 00:07:24.522
They're floating above themselves,

00:07:24.522 --> 00:07:28.672
see themselves
lying down on the stretcher,

00:07:28.692 --> 00:07:32.083
see us emergency physicians
and emergency nurses

00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:34.586
trying everything to bring them back.

00:07:35.375 --> 00:07:42.054
They see from above what we are doing,
and they can listen to what we say.

00:07:42.075 --> 00:07:46.507
The personality of the person
who is gone is still the same,

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.006
but they have left their body.

00:07:48.011 --> 00:07:50.046
We call this out-of-body experience.

00:07:50.062 --> 00:07:52.237
And what is annoying to us

00:07:52.237 --> 00:07:57.662
is that those people actually
can describe what we did,

00:07:57.671 --> 00:08:01.541
and can report what we said
when they come back.

00:08:01.546 --> 00:08:04.504
We have no explanation for this,

00:08:04.523 --> 00:08:11.405
and I cannot offer any explanation to you
because there is no brain activity at all.

00:08:11.432 --> 00:08:14.158
We all feel to build a memory,

00:08:14.168 --> 00:08:17.417
there has to be at least
a little bit of brain activity,

00:08:17.427 --> 00:08:19.736
but there is no brain activity.

00:08:19.743 --> 00:08:22.533
We do not have
a scientific explanation for this,

00:08:23.417 --> 00:08:25.668
but we know this phenomenon is there.

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:29.442
In the next phase,
there's again a sudden change.

00:08:29.452 --> 00:08:31.021
In the third phase,

00:08:31.409 --> 00:08:33.657
those people who have
a near-death experience

00:08:33.664 --> 00:08:38.306
describe that they are
in a dark, confined space.

00:08:38.655 --> 00:08:41.285
There is complete blackness.

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:48.246
98% to 99% of all those people
who have a near-death experience

00:08:48.562 --> 00:08:52.505
describe this being
in a dark, confined space

00:08:52.527 --> 00:08:57.930
as comfortable, as pleasant,
as warm, and soothing.

00:08:58.247 --> 00:09:03.112
But 1-2% of all those

00:09:03.117 --> 00:09:05.851
who have this near-death
experience in this stage

00:09:05.853 --> 00:09:07.223
describe it as frightening.

00:09:08.158 --> 00:09:15.076
1-2% say there are terrible noises,
terrible smells, and terrible creatures.

00:09:15.407 --> 00:09:19.338
And what those 1-2% tell us

00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:24.888
resembles strongly the pictures
by the medieval artist Hieronymus Bosch.

00:09:25.189 --> 00:09:30.184
One might suggest that Hieronymus Bosch
had a near-death experience,

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.828
or a vision of a near-death experience.

00:09:32.848 --> 00:09:36.399
But once again this is only 1-2%;

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:40.448
98-99% describe it as pleasant.

00:09:40.456 --> 00:09:41.912
And what is maybe comforting,

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:48.007
is that a certain proportion of those 1-2%
who describe it as unpleasancy

00:09:48.011 --> 00:09:50.839
[say] it later turns
into a pleasant event.

00:09:50.839 --> 00:09:57.742
These unpleasant, near-death experiences
in this third phase of the experience

00:09:57.758 --> 00:10:02.651
are not linked to any personality
or to any religion.

00:10:02.657 --> 00:10:04.098
I used to say,

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:05.976
if we could show

00:10:05.977 --> 00:10:12.484
that, let's say, Catholic people
have no unpleasant near-death experiences,

00:10:12.489 --> 00:10:13.946
and protestants [do],

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:17.750
then we would have billions
for our research in near-death events,

00:10:17.769 --> 00:10:20.969
but this is not the case -
we [cannot] predict [any] of this.

00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:23.770
Now comes the fourth stage.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:25.589
The fourth stage means:

00:10:25.595 --> 00:10:30.955
Out of this complete blackness,
a light begins to shine.

00:10:30.965 --> 00:10:32.719
This light is far away.

00:10:32.719 --> 00:10:37.088
This light is very warm,
very bright, very attractive.

00:10:38.027 --> 00:10:43.079
Towards this light, out of the blackness,
a tunnel is starting to form.

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:46.331
Those people are strongly
attracted towards this light,

00:10:46.337 --> 00:10:49.101
and start to fly towards this light.

00:10:49.108 --> 00:10:52.238
This light gets lighter
and brighter and closer.

00:10:52.244 --> 00:10:56.163
Then comes the last phase
of the near-death experience.

00:10:56.241 --> 00:11:00.779
Only 10% of those
who have a near-death experience

00:11:00.787 --> 00:11:02.453
reach this last phase.

00:11:02.464 --> 00:11:05.581
In this last phase,
once again there's a sudden change,

00:11:05.585 --> 00:11:07.927
and there's a beautiful surrounding,

00:11:08.141 --> 00:11:12.211
beautiful colours,
some say beautiful music,

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.059
and a feeling of unconditional love.

00:11:16.648 --> 00:11:18.234
In this last phase,

00:11:18.248 --> 00:11:22.159
it may happen that those people
who have a near-death experience

00:11:22.165 --> 00:11:25.065
have a flash forward
through their whole life,

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.240
starting from their birth,

00:11:27.251 --> 00:11:31.659
over all major events in their life
till their death.

00:11:32.236 --> 00:11:34.757
Not everyone has this,
but some describe it.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.715
Some describe that they meet,
in this last phase,

00:11:37.726 --> 00:11:40.994
relatives who have died before,

00:11:40.995 --> 00:11:42.678
and are greeted by them.

00:11:43.219 --> 00:11:50.015
Not all of them, but some of them,
report a being made out of light.

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:56.942
And this being made out of light
oozes out unconditional love to them,

00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:02.626
and they feel very, very warm
and happy to be in this place.

00:12:02.645 --> 00:12:05.822
But half of those

00:12:05.851 --> 00:12:10.722
who are in this last stage
of the near-death experience

00:12:10.734 --> 00:12:14.475
say that, at this point,
they decided to come back,

00:12:14.475 --> 00:12:18.072
mainly because they feel
that there is a task in their life

00:12:18.072 --> 00:12:21.823
which is not fulfilled yet,
and has to be fulfilled.

00:12:21.823 --> 00:12:23.634
The other half tells

00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:27.658
that either the relative,
or the being out of light,

00:12:27.662 --> 00:12:29.839
tells them to go back

00:12:29.843 --> 00:12:33.944
because there is something
which has to be done still in life.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:38.118
Once again, I do not have
any scientific explanation for that,

00:12:38.127 --> 00:12:41.538
we just know that it is there.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:45.885
All these phases, all these experiences,
are well described,

00:12:45.916 --> 00:12:48.632
and occur all over the world.

00:12:48.651 --> 00:12:50.830
While this is happening,

00:12:50.845 --> 00:12:54.325
we emergency physicians
and emergency nurses

00:12:54.325 --> 00:12:58.615
do everything we can
to bring these people back,

00:12:58.615 --> 00:13:01.473
we do everything we can
to bring these people back.

00:13:01.473 --> 00:13:04.664
Resuscitation by live people is easy:

00:13:04.664 --> 00:13:06.233
call for help,

00:13:06.247 --> 00:13:09.179
and push hard, push fast,
in the centre of the chest.

00:13:09.186 --> 00:13:10.396
That's all.

00:13:10.404 --> 00:13:13.014
Do that until the ambulance is there.

00:13:13.014 --> 00:13:15.185
For us emergency physicians,

00:13:15.185 --> 00:13:19.396
resuscitation is a very complex
and complicated task.

00:13:19.408 --> 00:13:23.287
You have to know a lot
to resuscitate people properly.

00:13:23.695 --> 00:13:29.579
At the present, we can bring back
7% of those we try to bring back,

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.522
hopefully, more in the future.

00:13:32.233 --> 00:13:34.384
Now comes something very interesting.

00:13:34.392 --> 00:13:40.501
Those people whom we bring back
and had a near-[death] experience

00:13:40.777 --> 00:13:44.783
reveal certain personality
changes after that.

00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:49.626
And those we bring back,
and have not had a near-death experience,

00:13:49.626 --> 00:13:52.457
do not show these personality changes.

00:13:53.687 --> 00:13:55.595
The difference is very significant.

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:58.302
The personality changes are,

00:13:58.308 --> 00:14:01.124
people who have
a near-death experience are,

00:14:01.126 --> 00:14:03.506
after these near-death experiences,

00:14:03.506 --> 00:14:05.400
more empathic,

00:14:05.438 --> 00:14:07.667
they are more social oriented,

00:14:07.674 --> 00:14:10.103
they lose their interest,
may lose their interest,

00:14:10.104 --> 00:14:12.104
in materialistic values.

00:14:12.344 --> 00:14:16.236
They are more spiritual,
not more religious, but more spiritual.

00:14:16.439 --> 00:14:18.559
And what is very, very interesting,

00:14:18.567 --> 00:14:22.240
they completely lose their fear of dying.

00:14:23.147 --> 00:14:27.757
98-100%, [according]
to the different studies,

00:14:27.757 --> 00:14:30.745
of all those who had
a near-death experience

00:14:30.748 --> 00:14:34.116
completely lost their fear of dying.

00:14:34.716 --> 00:14:39.287
How do I dare to talk to you
about this topic?

00:14:40.732 --> 00:14:43.403
I'm not an expert in dying,
I'm still alive.

00:14:44.762 --> 00:14:46.753
I'm not an expert in near -

00:14:46.756 --> 00:14:49.364
Now, I may be called an expert
in bringing people back:

00:14:49.367 --> 00:14:52.915
this is my job for many years now.

00:14:53.136 --> 00:14:57.097
I have never had
a near-death experience of my own,

00:14:57.097 --> 00:15:01.498
but when I started
to study near-death experiences,

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.760
what happened to me
is that I found everything familiar.

00:15:06.328 --> 00:15:07.701
Everything.

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:12.117
Each phase, each twist,
each turn sounded very familiar to me.

00:15:12.997 --> 00:15:19.008
So, if I had known this all before,
there might be an explanation for this.

00:15:19.027 --> 00:15:20.487
Science knows a phenomenon

00:15:20.487 --> 00:15:23.489
which is called
"empathic near-death event".

00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:26.016
Empathic near-death event occurs

00:15:26.016 --> 00:15:32.917
if someone is there at the moment of death
of a very close, beloved family member,

00:15:33.441 --> 00:15:35.240
or a relative.

00:15:35.598 --> 00:15:39.208
If someone is there
at the moment of death,

00:15:39.208 --> 00:15:41.800
or someone who is very close to him dies,

00:15:41.814 --> 00:15:48.750
one might suggest that this person
shares his near-death experience

00:15:48.751 --> 00:15:51.313
with a person who sits next to him.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.001
Now, I told you at the beginning,

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.670
I was with more than 2,000 humans

00:15:57.692 --> 00:16:01.035
when they crossed the line
from life to death, and died.

00:16:01.049 --> 00:16:05.933
And maybe, over the years,
at any point in time,

00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:11.640
those started to share
their near-death experiences with me.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:18.028
Over the years, I developed exactly
the same personality changes

00:16:18.074 --> 00:16:20.563
as those who had a near-death event,

00:16:20.586 --> 00:16:22.586
though I never had one myself.

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:28.880
This includes that I completely
lost every fear of dying,

00:16:29.484 --> 00:16:33.355
I know, it's nothing
to be afraid of, not at all.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:38.125
And this, my dear friends, is a message
I would like to share with you today.

00:16:39.012 --> 00:16:43.444
And maybe sometime,
when we meet on the other side,

00:16:44.376 --> 00:16:48.587
then tell me whether
I told you wrong today or right.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.110
(Applause)

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:53.751
Thank you.

00:16:53.751 --> 00:16:56.241
(Applause)
