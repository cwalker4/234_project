00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.760
In every century, there's war.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.640
In every century people get married.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.480
In every century people make a living.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.560
In every century people are surprised
that it still goes on the same way.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.720
We keep waiting
for some radical transformation

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.640
of the human condition,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.960
it is not going to come.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.200
We will still fight,
we will still love, will still eat.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.400
How we do that, that may change,

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.920
but we must always focus
on what is the permanent.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.480
In the 20th century, there was a great war;

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.800
It began in 1914, it ended in 1945.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.800
It transformed the map of the world

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.840
and transformed
the Arab world in particular.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.000
It created borders that may not be there,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.000
it created cities that hadn't been there,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.640
it was a tremendous change in human history.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.840
It has now been 70 years
since the end of that war,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.160
and we cannot understand this moment

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.400
unless we understand the end of the war

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.480
and what it gave us.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.720
At the end of the war,
Europe faced a moral abyss.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.640
It had done something unthinkable.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.640
Between 1914 and 1945.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.160
100 million people dead,
100 million people dead.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.120
And it confronted itself
and asked the question:

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.920
How could this be?

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.760
How could we, the most civilized
part of the world, have done this?

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.720
They thought of themselves that way.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.240
And they drew
two conclusions from the war:

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.520
the first...

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.560
was that there had to be multinational
organizations, that this war occurred

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.160
because the League of Nations had failed,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.000
because at Munich we had been weak,
it is because we hadn't stuck together.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.440
The second conclusion they drew
is that the problem was nationalism.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.680
That somehow we must control nationalism,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.640
before it destroys us.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.240
And for 70 years

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.400
the primary moral political economic
project of the world

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.320
has been to create a world
in which the nation-state

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.840
cannot do what it did from 1914 to 1945.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.240
To create a world
in which the nation-state

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.120
was brought under control.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.240
And many of the things we look at:
NATO, the European Union,

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.640
the various entities that came out
of the Bretton Woods Agreement

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.160
like the IMF and the World Bank

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.520
these institutions worked,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.720
we know it worked because during that
time there was no Great War,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.360
during that time
there was relative prosperity,

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.520
during that time,
it was not a bad time to live.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.480
there are very... not very complicated
measures about such matters.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.920
But the problem that it posed is that it
challenged

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.920
the fundamental moral principle
that had been with us

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.080
since the French Revolution. 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.080
The right to national
self-determination.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.720
And it challenged it
in an interesting way,

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.720
it created NATO and it created the EU
and it created everything else

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.320
but also created a class
we will call technocrats;

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.640
A group of people whose right to rule

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.720
derived from some sort of expertise.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.520
They were not elected,
they were not answerable in many ways,

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.200
in some ways they were,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.000
but throughout the EU,
throughout NATO,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.800
through out the various
multinational entities that it had created,

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.600
there was this class of expert,

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.080
and they were supposed
to deliver us from our worst impulses.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.160
The problem with this class is there's
only one justification for them:

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.120
they work.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.640
They have no justification
as representing anyone,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.040
they have no justification in terms of
moral rights,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.160
The only justification for
the technocrats is they do a good job.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.120
And the problem that happened

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.520
began in two weeks,
in seven weeks I should say

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.440
in 2008.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.840
On august eighth,

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.120
Russia went to war with Georgia.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.440
And we suddenly discovered
that all of the assumptions

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.640
about what the world would look like,

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.760
what geopolitics would look like
after 1991 were false.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.920
Russia was back, it made war,

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.240
and the entire international community
did nothing to stop them.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.840
Could not stop them.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.920
The second thing happened
seven weeks later,

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.080
Lehman Brothers collapsed.
And with this we discovered 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.600
that for all the technocrats

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.640
who were overseeing the financial
industry, for all the technocrats

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.320
that were monitoring,
for all of the financial engineers

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.520
that were being produced

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.680
by the Wharton School
or for Harvard Business,

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.760
they were trading things
they didn't understand.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:29.920
In 1825, there was a great
financial crash in Britain.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.200
It occurred because they were buying
bonds from Latin American countries

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.960
that didn't exist.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.080
but it didn't matter because they
traded them back and forth

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.640
and they were quite happy.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.920
Until one day they realized
it wasn't there.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.200
This is what happened
with Lehman Brothers,

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:59.760
Everyone knew that the price
of real estate could only go up.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.880
Just as they knew that the third world
debt crisis could not occur,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.200
Or anything else.
And what came out of that crisis

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:17.320
was this. The United States on the whole
handled it fairly well.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.880
On a Sunday,
the head of the Federal Reserve.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.880
Secretary of Treasury, the bankers
went into room,

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.760
broke several laws I'm sure,

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.280
And came up with a solution that opened
the banks the the next day.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.600
No room was large enough
to hold all the Technocrats of Europe.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.080
Eight years after the collapse

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.680
of Lehman Brothers,
Europe still has not come to terms 

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.040
with a solution to the crisis.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.320
Eight years after the Russian attack
on Georgia,

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.400
the great multinational institution
still have not come to terms

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.680
with what to do about Russia.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.200
But it was more than that, it's really
in Europe that we see this,

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.920
that when it became important

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.040
the Germans didn't want
to help the Greeks,

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.560
The Greeks didn't want
to pay back to the Germans,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.600
Why? Because we're Germans,
they're Greeks.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.400
And then the great fantasy broke.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.400
The idea that a European civilization
was being born,

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.080
in which borders didn't matter,
suddenly it mattered very much.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.160
Whether you were Greek or Spanish,
because in your country

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.400
the unemployment rate
was above twenty percent.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.600
Or if you're a German because in
your country

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.480
unemployment rates were
well below five percent.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.320
Suddenly the statement, it doesn't
matter, we're all Europeans,

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.160
was falsified.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.360
And what happened in Europe,

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:16.600
in a slow and unfolding process,
was the emergence of nationalism,

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.960
out of self-defence.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.440
it had never gone away,

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.360
the European Union had never figured
out a way

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.280
to actually abolish it,
it was always there.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.800
But if you were a citizen of a nation,

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.960
you understood something,
the fate of Europe is not your fate,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.320
in other words,
there is not a European outcome,

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.000
there is a German outcome,
there is a Greek outcome,

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.280
there is a Danish outcome.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.120
It was not that people decided
to become nationalists,

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.800
it is that the reality was...

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.240
there were nations, and where you live
determined what you did.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.600
And technocrats said on the whole
we're doing okay.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
There's an old American story:
if you put a man head in the oven,

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.880
a man's feet in ice,

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.960
on average, he's doing okay.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
But unfortunately, not living very well.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.720
But it went deeper than that,

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.440
because it was not nearly
a difference between countries,

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.720
it was within countries.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.640
The effect of 2008,

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.840
was not the same for everyone.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.800
There was one effect for the technocrats,

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.520
and now I'll use this badly,
this name badly, to...

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.560
describe this entire class
who manage things,

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.480
from finance to governments,
who did fairly well

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:10.120
and there were those who absorbed
the twenty percent unemployment.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.200
And they saw Europe
in a very different way,

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.440
and they saw each other
in a very different way.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.160
They saw Europe
as you usuping their future.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.080
If you're a Greek
and you're 45 years old

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.240
and you lose your job,
you will never get another one like it.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.840
The devastation...
that was drawn in Europe...

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.600
was stunning.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.480
It was stunning
because it was so unequally balanced

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.560
and it was stunning because
the technocratic elite was oblivious

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.760
to the price
that was being paid by others.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.600
What does that leave you?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.440
To demand for the right
for national self-determination.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.000
If you live in one of these countries

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.280
and you realize that your generation
has been destroyed,

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.840
or a class in a generation
has been destroyed,

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.600
what is there left to you?
Your nation

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.480
And what is your Prime Minister
going to?

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.000
He is going to protect your nation.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.200
And what is the elite going to do?
Attack the Prime Ministers

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.480
who protect their nation.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.800
Victor Orban of Hungary,

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.640
who is disliked deeply
by the aristocrats,

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.400
or technocrats, I should say,

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.840
was face with a situation

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.400
that in the 1990s, mortgages were sold
to Hungarians,

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.200
denominated in euros, yen,

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.840
Swiss francs, everything.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.920
the Forint, the Hungarian currency,
went down.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:16.200
Orban went to the EU and said:
"Look"

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.520
"We're going to pay you back in Forints,

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.480
and we're going to pay you back sixty
percent on the dollar,

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.560
or will pay you nothing,
go home, think about it

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.720
let me know in the morning."

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.160
Orban represented the Hungarian people.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.120
He was overwhelmingly elected,

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.520
And the European Union
tried to delegitimize him. Why?

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:51.440
Both because he believed more
in national self-determination

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.040
than in the liberal ideology
of the country,

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.160
and because of the Europeans,

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.800
and because he challenged
the basic assumptions

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.520
which is that you may not protect
your people

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.760
at the expense of the Union, but he did.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.760
It was a great moment in European
history that will be remembered,

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.480
for better or worse,

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:21.440
what we now have of course
is a tremendous division, 

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.280
not only in Europe
but in the United States and elsewhere

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.360
between those who have
absorbed the price

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.800
of national and international policies,

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.120
and those who've benefited.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:39.280
the level of hatred is profound,
the anger is overwhelming,

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.240
any attempt to say:
"look, this had to happen,

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.360
this anger this rage"
is rejected out of hand.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.320
But it's there, it is an empirical fact
that we have to deal with.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:58.280
And in terms of thinking
of the next hundred years,

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:05.960
think of this, think of a world which is
more like the 19th century 

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.000
than like the 20th century.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.200
For 70 years, it was one way.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.760
And now it's going in other way and this
will be the rest of the century.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.600
In the end, the French Revolution
and the Enlightenment was right.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:29.160
In the end, there has to be
a community that binds us together,

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:34.000
in language and religion and history
and this is our nation.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.800
And in the end you must be allowed
to control your faith

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:45.640
In a democratic way, and in the end
your job is not to satisfy anyone else,

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.880
but yourself.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.560
This is not to say that trade
will not take place,

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.880
of course a trade will take place.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.320
This does not mean that alliances
will not take place,

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.440
of course they will take place.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.600
It does not mean that any of our
basic relations will not take place

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.960
but they will not be hardwired,

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.120
they will not be automatically
part of the system.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.400
I think the United States
will have a close relationship

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.480
of the United Arab Emirates.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.040
It does not mean that it's eternal,

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.960
it's permanent or inviolable.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:28.320
we will have leaders who challenge
the basic norms of past 70 years 

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.520
for a very simple reason,

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.040
what was true 70 years ago
is no longer true.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.320
And the pain that trying to live
that way

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.280
is extreme.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.080
During the Brexit crisis,

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.840
I remember many people saying:
"I don't know who these people are.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.520
I've never met
the people who voted for Brexit."

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.480
And therein lies the problem,

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.920
there was a time when

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.280
you would know people
from different classes,

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.840
it's very difficult to think of a time
like this one.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:14.040
That there's so little interchange
between the two.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.080
In the United States
those who hate Donald Trump

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.280
don't know those who love him.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:26.960
It's like I live in two countries,
since I dislike him and don't hate him.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.280
And I travel between the two countries
and it is inappropriate

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.560
to criticize him in one,

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.000
that means... or praise in the other,

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:41.800
and that means that there will be
substantial internal instability

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.400
in countries.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.480
I think it won't rip the countries apart

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.880
but it will be substantial instability.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.600
Certainly, countries will rise
and countries will fall.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.600
The United States' is twenty-five
percent of the world's economy.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.000
One dollar in four
is produced by the United States.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.520
No matter how stupid we are,
that is a fact.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.280
No matter how stupid we are
we control the oceans.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.480
No matter how stupid we are,
we can send forces

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.120
throughout the world.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.320
No matter how stupid we are,
we can make mistakes,

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.280
because we have so much.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.120
Some countries that declined,

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.760
we are seeing the second act
of the collapse of the Soviet Union now.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:35.160
Russia heavily dependent on oil,
can't survive in this price.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.440
China is doing what Japan did,

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.360
Becoming a normal country,
growing at a normal rate,

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:48.800
but unlike China, it has a billion
people living an extraordinary poverty.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:56.520
Germany, derives fifty percent
of its GDP from exports.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:02.080
In a world in stagnation, in recession,
I don't know how you keep that up

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.040
except by cutting prices,
which they did.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.800
Countries will emerge.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.440
The great power of East Asia for me
is at Japan.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.400
The third-largest economy
and those are actually true numbers.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.680
The third largest economy

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:25.840
socially stable society
and a substantial Navy.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.080
Turkey, when I said this 10 years ago,

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.640
that Turkey would be a great power,
they laughed uncontrollably.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.760
now the laughter is controlled.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.080
Russia faces Turkey as an equal.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.440
Turkey faces Russia as an equal.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.080
And tries to decide what it will do,

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.960
and hopes that it will not have to do
anything,

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.280
but it will have to do something.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:55.320
And Poland as Russia weakens,
and Germany weakens 

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.920
take a look at the numbers,
what is the fastest growing economy

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.480
in Europe? Poland.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:06.440
So this is what remains the same,
there will be rising powers,

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.360
there will be declining powers,

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.960
there will be powers
that remain in place.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:16.320
They will be different.
But what we have seen I think

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.040
is the end of the myth of two things:

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:25.560
the multilateral institutions will solve
all of our problems.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.920
The second myth that is if you get
somebody from Harvard

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.520
to manage it,

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.800
it's far more difficult than that.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:41.200
And the second myth is
do not look at the GDP.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.880
Look at how the GDP is distributed,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.600
because that will tell you
what your future looks like.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.800
The world will not change,

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.800
there will be nations,
there will be wars,

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:56.640
there will be money, there will be love,
there will be all these things.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.320
The names of the players will be different.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.920
They're changing before our eyes.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:08.120
But the thing to understand
is that the period that began in 1945,

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:13.000
is coming to an end, and seventy
years is a very long time for any period.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:19.880
The idea that the solution is "let us all
go back to what was" would be nice.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.880
But the price has been too high
and the cost unsupportable.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:30.280
So what I would urge you to think about
here in the Emirates,

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.040
and you are in a unique position,

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:39.800
and you have maintained in many ways
your independence, your options,

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:44.760
your rights, is how you manage this
in the next 70 years. 

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:51.240
Because it is an enormously complex issue
to be responsible for your sovereignty.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.720
It is far easy to give it to someone,

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.360
and very difficult to take it back.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:02.280
Let me end here and let me urge you
to consider

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
that I mourn the past 70 years.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.160
It was a good time,

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.600
but no matter how much I would mourn it,
it's done, now we move on.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.080
Thank you
