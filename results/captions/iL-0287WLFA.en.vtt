00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.680
So I bought this this morning, I made 1 spliff
out of this and it was a really big spliff

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.829
because it was my morning one and it knocked
me out, but that's it, that's it there.

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.530
It's not much but thats ranging round about
5 pound but you're only going to need about

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.920
probably that little tiny bit there to knock
you out.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.520
He couldn't sleep one night and someone offered
him a bit of a joint

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.380
and that got him to sleep one night.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.000
The next night he thought it was a good idea,
you know what I mean, and that's how these

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.240
addictions start.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.720
I get a couple of joints out of it, 3 or 4
joints out of it and that does me, that'll

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.890
do me until about 6 in the morning.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.320
Every morning my stomach hurts, sometimes
I can be sick, depends on what stuff I've

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.280
been smoking.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.580
So sometimes after 2 drags I can wake up with
burns in my jacket, because I passed out with

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.740
a joint.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.560
I put that in a joint and I'll probably take
a knock on that.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.120
That little tiny bit, but that does it, that
stops the stomach cramps, it stops everything.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.460
It's like it's just taken over, seriously
took over.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.880
People will see it as an easy answer to living
life easy on the streets.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.070
You don't feel nothing, you don't see nothing,
you don't feel nothing.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.940
You know what yeah...

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.140
Do you think that's why people take it?

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.620
Yeah because it blocks everything on these
streets out, everything.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.480
If I blew it in your face, it'll probably
knock you out, like get you stoned.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.560
It's lethal really.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.400
You're awake, you're aware but you're not
in control something takes over you and you're

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.520
just stuck, you can't move.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.239
Makes everything go away, you're just floating,
you know what I mean, you just shut your eyes,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.240
just calm, you feel relaxed, you feel comfortable.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.760
I like it, because it gets you proper stoned.

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:00.409
I think it is, it's horrible the way it's
made but every drug is horrible. I think

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:07.000
people just are very judgmental, no one goes
I want belly ache in the morning, I want to

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.959
throw up in the morning.

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.470
No human wants that, they don't want to be
in pain but when they smoke it and are comfy,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.680
time flies absolutely flies.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.080
It seems like this place is very hectic as
well.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.760
It is very hectic and I've just been speaking
to the guys then, the reason why it's so hectic

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.720
is because we don't close the door on anyone.

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.859
You know if somebody comes, we're a crisis
led service, somebody comes to the front door

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:16.400
and they need help because you can't, we have
a drop in Tuesday, Friday 2 until 4 but you

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.080
can't say to somebody "have a crisis at 2
o'clock on Tuesday and we'll help you."

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.090
Has the situation in Manchester got worse
since it's been criminalised?

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.630
Yep, a lot worse because now you're not getting
sealed packets so you don't know what's in

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.080
them, some spice that you buy on Deansgate
is different to what you might buy on Piccadilly Gardens

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.760
It's now kind of, every man for himself, it
can be tampered with a lot more because it's

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.630
now being sold in the snap bags, and it's
turned a sort of community of people against

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.419
each other now because one may not smoke spice
anymore but they'll sell it and they're getting

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.640
people to go out and beg for it and they're
actually making people, "I'll give you some

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.919
spice but you need to go out and beg for it
and then give me the money that you get from

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.490
begging" so it's a hundred, million times
worse than it was before the ban.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.540
So why, why do they need to get themselves
into such a state that they're on a different

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.460
planet and not being able to deal with their
day to day life, if we can get to the root

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.480
cause of that problem and the reason why they
feel that way, then we can tackle it.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.320
Criminalising it makes absolutely no difference
whatsoever.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.720
I'd pay double for a packet of it if I can
get it in a packet rather than what I showed

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.210
you last night in a bag off the street, I'd
rather get it in a packet.When it says it

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.200
on a packet, it says what's in it, exactly
what's in it on the back of it.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.110
Do you know when I first smoked spice?

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.280
In Strangeways there, that's where I first
smoked spice.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:51.560
In cell 21 on the fours, me and Sitch it was,
we bought a joint on the yard for a fiver.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.759
This is Bury New Road, this is where the legalised
shop was in the first place, I guarantee if

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.920
we walked on that side, and yous didn't have
them cameras out we would get offered spice.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.520
I was buying packets from the shop and it
was like you could get a gram for a fiver,

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.080
you could get half an ounce for £15.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.680
It was a lot cheaper and it had on the packets
what was in it.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.000
You could get black chronic, green chronic,
erm, clockwork orange.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.630
When you were getting it in the packets from
the shop behind us, right, if you were getting

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.460
it in the packets from there you knew what
was in it.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.229
It said everything that was in it and it also
said not for human consumption, and believe

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:38.159
me I don't know what's in it, nobody knows
what's in spice right now.

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:43.180
The other day I smoked a joint, and when I
came round I've got 2 paramedics with me and

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.680
I didn't even know and they were saying to
me, "come on shaun, get in the ambulance"

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.960
and I was saying "what are you on about, I
don't need an ambulance" and they're saying

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.889
"you do, you're out cold on the floor near
the road" and I don't know anything about

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:59.040
it and that's because I don't know what's
in spice, the spice that's about now because

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.960
you just don't know what's in it.

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:05.210
I don't care how much spice I've got to smoke,
I'll smoke as much as it takes, that way I

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.760
don't feel it, I don't feel like my baby died
last year, I don't feel like my mum's dying,

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.830
I don't remember any of it, I don't want to
remember any of it, that's why I do it, that's

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:18.740
why I won't go home, that's why I'm carrying
it on and I will carry it on until my mum's

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.680
gone because I can't sit there watching it,
I'm not like my brothers and my sisters I

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.699
can't sit there and watch her die, I can't
do that, so I've put myself on the street,

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:32.200
I'll stay on the street and be out here rather
than watching my mum die.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.360
People smoke it because it's cheap and easy,
when they smoke spice it makes you forget

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.630
about your problems, like if you smoke that
you're not going to think where am I staying

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.560
tonight, where am I gonna have a wash, where
am I gonna get food from, you don't think nothing.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.640
You wake up, you have a drag, spiced out of
your head, all you're thinking now is

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.120
where am I going to get my next bag? Where am I going to get my next bag?

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.840
Kids are just getting origami or like chopped
up marshmallows plants, soaking it in acetone,

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:09.330
nail varnish remover, liquid cleaner for your
alloys, soaking it and because it's got chemicals

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.060
soaked into it, smoking it's dangerous.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:17.479
It's stronger now than it ever was before,
so it's more of a dangerous situation now

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.280
than it was back then, do you know what I
mean.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:27.750
The way that spice is generally manufactured
is that the chemical is purchased, usually

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:35.219
through the dark web, and it's imported illegally
and then what will happen is is it's a powder

00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:41.550
which is then dissolved up in an appropriate
solvent something like nail varnish remover,

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:48.240
something like that, it's them mixed within
a plant material and then dried and then separated

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.480
into the small bags that we see on the street.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:09:00.160
I was smoking upwards of 58 gram a day to
try and kill myself, to get rid of the pain

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.720
of losing my sister, my nan and so many friends.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:09.320
I ended up, there is no other way to describe
it other than drug induced psychosis, I was

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.360
seeing things that weren't really there, police
officers approached me one morning and I've

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.290
lashed out because I didn't see a police officer,
I've just seen a shape coming at me and I've

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:23.550
ended up in prison for 6 months for ABH, which
after my release, I started smoking spice

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:29.220
again, it was about 3 weeks after my release
I smoked a large spliff of spice, and I ended

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:34.220
up vomiting uncontrollably and I ended up
rupturing my stomach to the point where I

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:38.410
was vomiting blood, I threw up a pint and
a half of my own blood and ended up in a 14

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:41.720
day coma in St Thomas' hospital.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.670
Absolutely destroyed me, I ruined my life
with it, I ended up homeless, I ended up walking

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:50.290
away from my friends, my job, my home, everything
all because of spice.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.950
It's like I'd never go near it again and I'd
warn any one of my friends to stay away from

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.240
it, because it kills people and it ruins your
life.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.920
They'll typically say you know, "I know it
sounds daft but when you smoke it on the streets,

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:06.089
it makes you feel warm, it's like you've got
a warm blanket around you" that is exactly

00:10:06.089 --> 00:10:11.750
how a heroin user would talk about using heroin,
feeling warm, feeling enclosed, or again they

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:16.350
say it's the only thing that gets me to sleep,
you've been trying to get to sleep in a car

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:21.250
park, you're worried about being attacked,
feeling very vulnerable, if I smoke a joint

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.320
of spice, it gets me to sleep.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:29.400
So it seems to have this ability to condense
time whether it's to make 3, 4,5 hours pass,

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.920
make a long period of time feel shorter, so
again you speak to homeless people and they'll

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.760
say "I've been on the streets for 2 years,
it feels like 2 months."

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.040
How bad is spice when it come to addictiveness?

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.680
Horrific, it's you know, we've had people
that we know of sort of anecdotally that they've

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.850
swapped from heroin onto spice because it's
cheaper and then they've found it's harder

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.560
to get off spice than it is to get off heroin.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.440
How long would it be until I can pick up spice,
if I wanted too?

00:10:57.459 --> 00:11:02.500
10 minutes, and 7 minutes of that is walking
up the street, so it's very, it's easy and

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.290
if you see people in a certain way, you'd
approach them and ask them where they get

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.600
it from, or if you're around the city centre
long enough somebody will probably ask you

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.640
if you want to buy some.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.320
I could take you right now to the centre of
Piccadilly Gardens and just stand there on

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.840
1 spot like this and you'll watch people coming
to me saying "do you want to buy spice?"

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.360
that's the worse thing, that's how horrible
it is in Manchester now, spice is too easy

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.000
to get hold of, you can stand in 1 spot like
this, and someone will say do you want something,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.400
do you want weed? Do you want spice?

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.120
Do you want crack? Do you want heroin?

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.680
It's flooded,
the town is horrible.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.600
Every homeless person around the city centre
are all spice heads.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.280
Manchester's fucked through spice, spice has
fucked it.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.760
When the police made it illegal, that's when
they made it worse, if they had kept it legal

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.250
and drive everybody off it properly there
wouldn't be half the crime there is now, there

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:57.550
wouldn't be half the people on it now, because
obviously these police have just snapped it

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.360
off, shut the shops down, people are still
addicted to it.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.600
It's that bad that they're killing each other
for it, someone's gone in someones pocket

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.160
and because he's gone in someones pocket they've
then said you're coming picking an ounce up

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.270
with me, so when he were going for spice,
there weren't no fucking spice it was a stitch

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.610
up, they were just taking him to the canal
to kill him.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:21.440
They battered him, and then they've gone too
far and they've killed him, now he's been

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:26.840
killed, all through spice, that's the second
one, out of my mates that I know have been

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:31.880
killed over spice, 1 of them got burnt in
his tent, it was because he had spice and

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:36.520
the rest of them didn't, so they battered
him for his spice, that kid was only 19, 19

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:42.880
and he got killed, in a tent because of spice,
just because he had a few spliffs and they

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.139
didn't have a spliff, but because they wanted
a spliff and he had a spliff they killed that

00:12:47.139 --> 00:12:50.100
poor kid for that spice.

00:13:43.139 --> 00:13:49.600
So post ban, we've been seeing spice in this
sort of form here, so it's a very nondescript

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:55.699
green plant material, now if you actually
bought the cannabinoid on the market and then

00:13:55.699 --> 00:14:00.480
manufactured that you'd probably be spending
a couple of pounds to actually import the

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:06.730
cannabinoids so a gram of that, that would
produce 500 bags of half a gram in weight

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:10.960
and you'd probably get a markup of about £2500.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.560
You've sort of got a catch 22 there, all the
drug dealers now like the people who used

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:21.269
to deal cocaine, heroin, crack, all the big
time drug dealers now have sort of moved away

00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:25.350
from that, they still do that on the sidelines
but now they've got spice as a main avenue

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:27.820
because it's such a moneymaker.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:32.550
It's quite basic and quite easy to do, you
can go online now and you can search how to

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:38.410
make spice, how to make synthetic cannabinoids
and there's been a step-by-step set of instructions

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.110
about how you would actually do that.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.200
So if you think how many homeless people are
in Manchester city centre, say as a rough

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:54.480
number, say 5000, as a rough number, 5000
people get 10 or 20 pound a day, 5000 times

00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:01.230
10 or 20, that's 50 grand, that's a lot of
money, that's a lot of income to be getting,

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:05.240
just from people begging off others on the
streets, never mind people have got jobs,

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:12.240
who get a wage and pay for it like that, it's
such stupidly easy money that people, they

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.240
just think they're stupid to turn away from
it.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.160
People that are on it, it's hard for them
to get off though, you know it's hard to actually

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.240
realise I want to stop and I need help, we
can't tell them to stop smoking it, they've

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.920
got to want the change themselves.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.839
You know there's death involved but you still
take that chance, 50-50 chance, every drag

00:15:42.839 --> 00:15:45.420
is a 50-50 chance if you're gonna live or
die.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.640
Basically is, because 1 drag could kill somebody.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:54.360
It's kind of like a heroin withdrawal in a
way because you start, your stomach starts

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.280
cramping, you start sweating when you're freezing,
you know you're cold, so you're wrapped up

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:01.840
in a big coat but you start sweating and sweating,
you start shaking, physically shaking like

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.480
that, you'd be sick, I had blood coming out
of me, here there and everywhere.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.509
How easy is it to get addicted too?

00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:10.899
It's like that.

00:16:10.899 --> 00:16:16.620
I know people that have been on the streets
for 30, 40 years, they've been heavy heroin

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:21.420
and crack users for those 30 or 40 years and
even they won't go anywhere near spice.

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:26.050
I mean I've physically seen it with my own
eyes, people who have woken up thinking that

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:29.850
they're gonna have the sweats and the runs
from a heroin withdrawal and really they're

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:33.630
shaking from a spice withdrawal and they haven't
even noticed that they haven't done gear for

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.800
like 4 weeks and they've just been smoking
spice.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:47.120
The spice yeah, when it used to be in the
packets they never knocked you out like that,

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:52.040
it would knock you out yeah, but not like
that, like now you can take 2 or 3 pulls of it, out.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:56.190
I thought I'd go from heroin to spice but
I haven't, I've ended up still having a heroin

00:16:56.190 --> 00:17:01.360
habit, a spice habit and a crack habit, so
instead of getting rid of a smack habit and

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.790
getting a spice habit I've ended up commandeering
all 3.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:10.130
So every morning, I do go for 3 bits, a bag
of spice, a bag of smack and a piece of crack

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:16.810
and that's breakfast, that's my breakfast,
I won't eat or anything until I've done that,

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:21.000
when I've done that, that's me good to go,
I'm good for everything then when I've had

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.400
that, so until I've had that, I'm just the
nastiest bastard under the sun.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:41.400
Spice to me it's a whole new class, you get
your class B, C, A, I think spice is another

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:46.800
class above A anything man made with chemicals
now they're calling it a new form of spice,

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.640
like crystallised MDMA they're saying it's
crystallised spice, because it's the new man

00:17:51.659 --> 00:17:52.690
made chemical drug.

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:58.160
It can kill you instantly, instantly man,
1 little dab of that can end you.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:11.840
The concentrations have, the potencies have
been around 2 to 7% prior to the ban, post

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:18.200
ban we saw a massive spike specifically in
Manchester and that was associated with a

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:25.080
significant rise in potency by about 10 times
the normal dose, so we're looking at between

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:33.320
about 17 to 20% and that was directly linked
to about 53 emergency call outs that were

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.880
received one weekend.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:42.360
Originally we'd say compared to cannabis,
you could buy a gram for £10 and you

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:48.320
could get 30 to 40 joints from 1 gram so people
talk about just needing a tiny pin head or

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.640
like the equivalent to a grain of rice and
put that in a joint, then people would talk

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.780
about in a matter of months the tolerance
builds up to such a degree that they're then

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:01.990
smoking 5, 6, 7, 8 grams a day and it's quite
common when we've been doing the research

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:05.690
to see somebody put a half gram pack into
1 joint.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:11.610
So they go from getting 30 to 40 joints out
of 1 gram to just getting 1 or 2 joints out

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:12.760
of a pack.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.840
Not even a gram...

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.080
How long will that last you?

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:21.780
About 2 hours, I'll get a couple of joints
out of it, about 3 or 4 joints out of it and

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:26.160
that does me, that will do me until about
6 in the morning.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.400
Have you ever seen anything like this?

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:37.880
Never, never, and I'm old school, I remember
the Hacienda days of pills and MDMA and all

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:42.160
those kind of things, I'd call it an epidemic,
I've never seen anything like it.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.320
Just because you're in a shit place and you've
got nowhere else to go and you've got nothing

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.390
else to do, does not mean that you have to
sit there and smoke spice and obliterate yourself,

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:53.931
I reckon if you put any one of the politicians
that sit in the Houses of Parliament now,

00:19:53.931 --> 00:19:57.723
put them on the streets, go here you are, here's
a spliff of spice I'm going to come back to

00:19:57.723 --> 00:20:01.460
you in a months time and see how bad you are,
I guarantee they'll be sat there with no fucking

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.120
shoes on in a foil blanket begging for spice.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.920
That's what it does to everyone, it just strips
you of your humanity, everything you are as

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.470
a person.

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:12.950
If anything it's just a thousand times more
dangerous, because when it was still legal

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:18.120
it was being made by companies that were being
regulated, there was a certain amount of regulation

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:22.940
in the actual product itself, certain chemicals
weren't added, they were measured properly

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:28.330
but now people are buying the formulas online,
making it at home so people are making their

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:32.570
own mixtures up and editing the recipes in
different ways and that's why people are dying

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:34.500
so quickly now.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:38.549
So you don't know where the products come
from, you don't know how powerful it is, you

00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:42.200
don't know what's been added to it, what's
been taken away from it, basically it's a

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:46.440
game of roulette, if you go and buy spice
from a dealer in the city now you're playing

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.419
a game of roulette because 1 drag could kill
you.

00:20:48.419 --> 00:20:52.200
1 drag will drop you dead, because it could
have been laced.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:17.960
They could kill you for a fiver, just for
a £5 bag of spice, they could take your life

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:21.710
and they're not bothered because they've made
the money off it, now it's your family that

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:25.120
deals with everything after your spice use.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.680
It needs to stop doesn't it, spice is just
killing people, if the government carried

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.920
on selling it in the shop you wouldn't have
half of the problems you have now, I promise

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.400
you, it's a billion of pounds industry when
it was legal, so what's it going to be like

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.360
now it's illegal.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.120
It's a bad game man, bad.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:56.190
Now whether it's legal, class A, B or C it's
not really going to have any impact on people's

00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:01.150
decision making, whether to use it or not
and I think the focus as always should be

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:05.620
targeting the dealers and in terms of the
users it's about trying to engage them in

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.040
treatment.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:13.430
What we need to look at is reducing the onset,
most people that you speak too, they'll say

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:18.529
they were first introduced to spice in the
prison system so we need to do more work in

00:22:18.529 --> 00:22:22.960
the prison system to stop people using it,
because the prison system is basically churning

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:28.460
out spice users into the community, so if
you criminalise uses, you put them into prison,

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:32.840
then you know that's just self-perpetuating
this kind of cycle.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:40.680
Same place it is, smack and crack, a phone
call and it's fucking there, within 5, 10 minutes.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:45.520
If you don't want to do that, you walk to
Piccadilly Gardens or walk to fucking Deansgate

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.760
and you get it straight away, walk to Chinatown
you'll get it.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.360
Manchester city centre is full of spice.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:10.000
I'm a little bit stoned now, I feel alright.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:20.320
*inaudible*
