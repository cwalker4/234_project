00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.000
Over the long, graded hills of Chihuahua,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.490
Mexico, tucked deep within the Sierra

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.780
Madre Occidental, live people shrouded in

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.250
mystery -- and I went to find them. So I

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.139
drove five and a half hours from

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.730
Chihuahua to Guachochi to find out

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.140
why this elusive and indigenous

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:27.420
community are some of the best

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:30.000
long-distance runners in the world.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.669
Their name, Raramuri, means "those who run fast,"

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.290
and some historians say they've been

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.300
running deeper into these canyons for

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.340
centuries. When Cortes and his

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.440
conquistadors invaded and conquered the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.290
Aztec, they found refuge in this harsh

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.690
landscape. And today, they're the last

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.160
Native Americans in North America to

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.789
live the same lifestyle they did

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.129
centuries ago. So yeah, being an outsider,

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.469
how did I expect to meet them?

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.379
Well, there's a 100K ultra-marathon

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:03.420
in their hometown, and last year, 
a 22-year-old Raramuri named Lorena

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.189
Ramirez won the 50k in just a skirt and

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.100
plastic sandals, and she became an
overnight sensation.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.790
 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.040
 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:21.960
 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.430
 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.560
And she started doing some press, which gave me

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.460
an opportunity to meet 
these fascinating people.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.000
 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:35.380
I met Lorena at her cabin to see how she

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.350
prepared. She didn't eat anything except

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.000
a banana and a bite of croissant.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.610
She sipped on something called pinole, which

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.720
is milled corn, a few herbs, water, and

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.119
sometimes brown sugar.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.740
She didn't stretch, she didn't run up and

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.610
down the stairs or run up and down the

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:55.390
hall, but she was focused. When I asked

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.580
her why she ran, she said, "Because I'm

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.200
good at it."

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.400
To get a better understanding of how

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.950
they're different,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.690
I talked to Dr. Andres De Leon, who

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.049
conducted a study in collaboration
 with Copenhagen University.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:39.379
 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:44.080
 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:46.640
 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.560
 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.790
And their heart rate is slower, which is

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.790
common in other athletes

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:11.510
 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.520
 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.740
After running hundreds of miles in hard sandals in

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.080
this terrain, their feet become wider,

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:23.480
with thicker calluses, making them less

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:27.020
prone to injuries. She's in like 46-something

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.080
kilometers, and she's sprinting

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.760
up these f... these hills.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.700
Lorena's father, Santiago,
 was a part of these studies in 2012.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.450
 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.970
 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.530
 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:50.450
 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.560
 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:57.050
 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.890
 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:05.350
 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:08.000
 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:11.450
 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.720
 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:18.680
 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:23.050
 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.310
 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:31.070
 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:32.630
 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.060
When living their traditional lifestyle,

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.950
they're less prone to cancers, obesity,

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.979
and other common diseases found in

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.510
Western society. But when cities and the

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.090
associated lifestyles are introduced,

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.100
they begin to develop the same diseases.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.300
So for Lorena and her family, it's
important to keep it simple.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.050
 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.860
When I caught up with Lorena, around the

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.750
63K mark, she was 30 minutes in the lead.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:12.700
But then the temperature dropped and the
sky opened.

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:19.419
 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.470
 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:31.279
 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:43.310
 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.310
 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:50.830
 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:57.250
 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:06:00.040
 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:03.720
And somewhere in the pouring rain
 and hail, Lorena was passed by

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:06.280
Carmela Martinez of Mexico City, and

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.490
finished a minute behind to place second

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:12.250
in their division. Overall, the Raramuri

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.230
swept the race. Of the 100K

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:17.430
men's division, the top nine were all

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:19.600
Raramuri. The day after the race,

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.910
before going back into the mountains,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:25.600
where they would continue to run and I

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:38.170
left for the city, Lorena and her family

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:40.180
relaxed. Hey, thanks for watching! And if
