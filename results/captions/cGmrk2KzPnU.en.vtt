PRESIDENCY.

00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:13.513 align:start position:0%

ELECTION.

00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:49.449 align:start position:0%
THAT IS A FELONY.

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:56.089 size:84% position:42%
HENCE THE WHOLE JAIL THING.

00:00:56.122 --> 00:01:05.731 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; AN EASY GAME TO PLAY.

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:08.468 align:start position:0%
WE HAVE A MAN SITTING IN THE
WHITE HOUSE WHO IS AN

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:14.607 align:start position:0%
ESSENTIALLY AN UNINDICTED
CO-CONSPIRATOR.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.675 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HE'S AN UNINDICTED
COCONSPIRATOR.

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:16.709 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP COULD BE
UNINDICTED COCONSPIRATOR ON

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:17.810 align:start position:0%
THIS.

00:01:17.843 --> 00:01:18.344 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: I THINK WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO UPDATE THE

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:20.379 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; Stephen: THIS MORNING,

00:01:27.453 --> 00:01:31.557 align:start position:0%
DONALD TRUMP FIRED BACK AT THOSE
CHARGES.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
"I NEVER DIRECTED MICHAEL COHEN
TO BREAK THE LAW.

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:37.997 size:78% position:39%
HE WAS A LAWYER AND HE IS
SUPPOSED TO KNOW THE LAW.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.136 align:start position:0%
IT IS CALLED 'ADVICE OF
COUNSEL,' AND A LAWYER HAS GREAT

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:44.837
LIABILITY IF A MISTAKE IS MADE.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.206 size:84% position:42%
THAT IS WHY THEY GET PAID."

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:58.451 align:start position:0%
(AS TRUMP)
"I HIRED HIM TO BREAK THE LAW,

00:01:58.484 --> 00:02:02.955
BUT IN A WAY THAT WAS LEGAL."

00:02:02.988 --> 00:02:04.423 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
AND COHEN'S NOT THE ONLY ONE

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:08.127 align:start position:0%
INVOLVED IN THIS SCHEME WHO HAS
FLIPPED.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.497 align:start position:0%
SO HAS TRUMP'S CLOSE PERSONAL
FRIEND CHAIRMAN OF "THE NATIONAL

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.634

OLD WEST PROSPECTOR ABOUT TO

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:21.407 align:start position:0%
BURY YOU IN THIS RAP BATTLE,
DAVID PECKER.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.241 align:start position:0%
YES.

00:02:22.274 --> 00:02:26.078 align:start position:0%
TRUMP'S FRIEND IS NAMED DAVID
PECKER.

00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
GO AHEAD AND LAUGH.

00:02:27.312 --> 00:02:30.316
I KNOW IT'S FUNNY, THE IDEA OF
DONALD TRUMP HAVING A FRIEND.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:36.455 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:02:36.488 --> 00:02:40.860 align:start position:0%
( PIANO RIFF )
SEE, TRUMP MAY HAVE PAID OFF

00:02:40.893 --> 00:02:43.095
STORMY DANIELS, BUT YESTERDAY
COURT PAPERS REVEALED THAT THE

00:02:43.128 --> 00:02:46.933
ENQUIRER PAID KAREN MACDOUGAL
FOR EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO HER

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:51.437 size:84% position:42%
STORY ABOUT HER AFFAIR WITH
TRUMP, AND THEN BURIED IT.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.641 align:start position:0%
IT'S A PRACTICE IN TABLOID NEWS
KNOWN AS "CATCH AND KILL."

00:02:55.674 --> 00:02:59.979 align:start position:0%
IT'S ALSO WHAT ERIC AND DON JR.
CALL A DAY AT THE ZOO.

00:03:00.012 --> 00:03:06.686 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
THEY KILL ENDANGERED SPECIES.

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:07.286 align:start position:0%
THERE'S DOCUMENTATION.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.521 align:start position:0%
NICE KIDS.

00:03:08.554 --> 00:03:09.889 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
THIS IS A BIG DEAL BECAUSE UP

00:03:09.922 --> 00:03:11.657 size:88% position:44%
UNTIL NOW, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
MICHAEL COHEN'S WORD AGAINST

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.561 size:81% position:41%
TRUMP'S, BUT ACCORDING TO
ELECTION LAW EXPERTS, THIS

00:03:15.594 --> 00:03:18.197
ADMISSION BY PECKER, IS "HIGHLY
SIGNIFICANT, BECAUSE IT GOES TO

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.667 align:start position:0%
CORROBORATE."

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.837 align:start position:0%
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT A TABLOID
WOULD PLAY SUCH A BIG ROLE IN

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
THIS CRISIS?

00:03:27.072 --> 00:03:28.674
UP NEXT, THE "WEEKLY WORLD NEWS"
WITH "ELVIS IS ALIVE AND HE HAS

00:03:28.707 --> 00:03:31.244 align:start position:0%
THE PEE PEE TAPE."

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:36.315 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
"IT GOT ME ALL SHOOK UP."

00:03:36.348 --> 00:03:39.218 align:start position:0%
( APPLAUSE )
NOW, IN THEIR STATEMENT, "THE

00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:41.220 size:88% position:44%
ENQUIRER" PUBLISHER ADMITTED
THAT THE MEETING WHERE THEY

00:03:41.253 --> 00:03:43.623 align:start position:0%
AGREED TO PAY OFF KAREN
MACDOUGAL WAS ATTENDED BY

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:46.459 align:start position:0%
PECKER, COHEN, AND, "AT LEAST
ONE OTHER MEMBER OF THE

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:49.028 align:start position:0%
CAMPAIGN."

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:54.900
AND TODAY IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT
THE "OTHER MEMBER" WAS TRUMP.

00:03:54.933 --> 00:04:01.874 align:start position:0%
( AUDIENCE REACTS )
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

00:04:01.907 --> 00:04:05.745
TRUMP'S "OTHER MEMBER" IS WHAT
GOT HIM IN THIS PICKL IN THE

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:07.013 align:start position:0%
FIRST PLACE.

00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:11.350 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
ALSO, TRUMP'S PICKLE.

00:04:11.383 --> 00:04:14.453 align:start position:0%
A GHERKIN.

00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:15.521 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT THE DEAL?

00:04:15.554 --> 00:04:19.091 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHEN HE SAW HE WAS
IN TROUBLE

00:04:19.124 --> 00:04:20.993 size:88% position:44%
WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT,
TRUMP APPEALED TO A HIGHER

00:04:21.026 --> 00:04:22.895 align:start position:0%
AUTHORITY: FOX NEWS.

00:04:22.928 --> 00:04:25.798 align:start position:0%
WHERE HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THE
"ENQUIRER" CONTROVERSY.

00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:27.800
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK-- I HAVE TO GO
CHECK-- I DON'T THINK THEY EVEN

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:29.268
PAID ANY MONEY TO THAT TABLOID.

00:04:29.301 --> 00:04:30.403 align:start position:0%
OKAY?

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:35.941 align:start position:0%
I DON'T THINK WE MADE A PAYMENT
TO THAT TABLOID.

00:04:35.974 --> 00:04:37.310
I WAS ASKING THE QUESTION-- I
DON'T THINK WE MADE A PAYMENT.

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:39.145 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: (AS TRUMP)
"I'M NOT SURE, GOT TO CHECK.

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:42.014 align:start position:0%
I ALWAYS FORGET WHICH
PUBLICATIONS I PAID TO SILENCE

00:04:42.047 --> 00:04:45.251 align:start position:0%
MY PORN STARS AND WHICH
PUBLICATIONS MY PORN STARS

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:49.221 align:start position:0%
SPANKED ME WITH."

00:04:49.254 --> 00:04:53.125 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
THEN THE CONVERSATION TURNED TO

00:04:53.158 --> 00:04:54.827 size:88% position:44%
THAT TRAITOR, MICHAEL COHEN.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.495 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THIS IS SOMEONE WHO
SURREPTITIOUSLY RECORDED

00:04:56.528 --> 00:04:58.698 align:start position:0%
YOU--
&gt;&gt; TERRIBLE.

00:04:58.731 --> 00:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IS NOW KNOWN AS A CRIMINAL
LIAR.

00:05:00.632 --> 00:05:03.402 align:start position:0%
YET THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO WAS IN
YOUR INNER CIRCLE.

00:05:03.435 --> 00:05:07.073 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, WELL, IT HAPPENS.

00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:11.277 align:start position:0%
LOOK, IT HAPPENS.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.278
I HIRE, USUALLY, GOOD PEOPLE.

00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:13.446 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: (AS TRUMP)
"YEAH, I USUALLY HIRE GOOD

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.647 align:start position:0%
PEOPLE, EXCEPT FOR THOSE DOZENS
OF PEOPLE I'VE FIRED SINCE

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.915 align:start position:0%
BECOMING PRESIDENT.

00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:20.019 align:start position:0%
EVERY BARREL HAS A HUNDRED OR SO
BAD APPLES."

00:05:20.052 --> 00:05:23.956 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
BESIDES, TRUMP'S LAWYER WASN'T

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:26.592 align:start position:0%
REALLY TRUMP'S LAWYER.

00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HE DID MORE PUBLIC RELATIONS
THAN HE DID LAW.

00:05:28.193 --> 00:05:32.531 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: WHAT?

00:05:32.564 --> 00:05:33.966 align:start position:0%
BUT YOU JUST TWEETED THAT HE
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER BECAUSE

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:35.801 align:start position:0%
HE WAS YOUR LAWYER.

00:05:35.834 --> 00:05:38.871
"MICHAEL COHEN WAS THE MOST
BRILLIANT LEGAL MIND WHO KNEW

00:05:38.904 --> 00:05:43.075 align:start position:0%
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT
THE LAW.

00:05:43.108 --> 00:05:44.276 align:start position:0%
OKAY?

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:47.813 align:start position:0%
HE'S A CROSS OF ALAN DERSHOWITZ
AND A NARCOLEPTIC RACCOON."

00:05:47.846 --> 00:05:49.382 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
AND TRUMP KNOWS COHEN'S REAL

MOTIVATIONS.

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:53.586 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WHAT HE DID IS HE MADE A DEAL
TO EMBARRASS ME.

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:57.123 align:start position:0%
IN ORDER TO EMBARRASS ME, THEY
CUT HIS TERM DOWN.

00:05:57.156 --> 00:05:59.725
HOW MANY PEOPLE WHEN THEY SAY
"LISTEN, IF YOU EMBARRASS THE

00:05:59.758 --> 00:06:02.395 align:start position:0%
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
WE WILL GIVE YOU A DEAL."

00:06:02.428 --> 00:06:04.130
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: WELL, IF THEY'RE
GIVING OUT DEALS TO PEOPLE WHO

00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:12.171 align:start position:0%
EMBARRASS THE PRESIDENT, YOU
MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE!

00:06:12.204 --> 00:06:19.645 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Jon: IT'S A DEAL.

00:06:19.678 --> 00:06:20.846 align:start position:0%
YEAH.

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:23.382
&gt;&gt; Stephen: TRUMP DID HIS BEST
TO BRING THE CONVERSATION BACK

00:06:23.415 --> 00:06:26.318 size:78% position:39%
TO COMPLIMENTING HIMSELF.

00:06:26.351 --> 00:06:27.820
&gt;&gt; I THINK I HAVE THE GREATEST
BASE IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS.

00:06:27.853 --> 00:06:29.288
I HAVE PEOPLE THAT I LOVE AND
THAT LOVE ME, AND THAT INCLUDES

00:06:29.321 --> 00:06:30.856 align:start position:0%
A LOT OF WOMEN.

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:35.828 align:start position:0%
( AUDIENCE REACTS )
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: OH, HONEY... IF THE

00:06:35.861 --> 00:06:42.935 align:start position:0%

( APPLAUSE )

00:06:45.404 --> 00:06:50.609 align:start position:0%
( PIANO RIFF )
HEY, DADDY, YOU NEED A BASE

00:06:50.642 --> 00:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
TONIGHT?

00:06:53.312 --> 00:06:54.146 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
BUT WHILE ALL THIS IS BEING

00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:55.548 align:start position:0%
SORTED OUT, TRUMP IS STILL
PRESIDENT.

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:57.616
AND TUESDAY WE LEARNED THAT,
AFTER THEIR MEETING IN THE OVAL

00:06:57.649 --> 00:07:01.120 align:start position:0%

HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI THAT

"MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE
WALL."

00:07:08.494 --> 00:07:13.165 align:start position:0%
NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE MOCKED THE
PRESIDENT FOR THIS.

00:07:13.198 --> 00:07:14.333 align:start position:0%
BUT --
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:07:14.366 --> 00:07:25.644
-- THIS MORNING, HE EXPLAINED
HIS -- I WANT TO SAY LOGIC.

00:07:25.677 --> 00:07:26.979 align:start position:0%
"I OFTEN STATED, "ONE WAY OR THE
OTHER, MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY

00:07:27.913 --> 00:07:29.081 align:start position:0%
THIS HAS NEVER CHANGED.

00:07:29.114 --> 00:07:32.618
OUR NEW DEAL WITH MEXICO-- AND
CANADA-- THE U.S.M.C.A., IS SO

00:07:32.651 --> 00:07:37.690
MUCH BETTER THAN THE OLD, VERY
COSTLY AND ANTI-U.S.A. NAFTA

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:41.460
DEAL, THAT JUST BY THE MONEY WE
SAVE, MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE

( AUDIENCE REACTS )

00:07:47.533 --> 00:07:48.968 align:start position:0%
NO, THEY'RE NOT!

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:51.437 align:start position:0%
JUST BECAUSE YOU SAVE MONEY
SOMEWHERE ELSE IN A DEAL BETWEEN

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.973 size:84% position:42%
THREE NATIONS DOESN'T MEAN
THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

00:07:57.643 --> 00:08:01.447 align:start position:0%
