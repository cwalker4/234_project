00:00:06.796 --> 00:00:08.456
Good afternoon.

00:00:08.456 --> 00:00:09.556
(Laughter)

00:00:10.696 --> 00:00:14.976
This is the final border.

00:00:18.216 --> 00:00:21.976
All of you are going to die.

00:00:24.696 --> 00:00:28.837
Most of you are afraid.

00:00:31.427 --> 00:00:33.036
Why are you afraid?

00:00:33.706 --> 00:00:37.197
Because you don't know
what is going to happen.

00:00:38.687 --> 00:00:42.246
I expect, many of you think
it's going to be like this:

00:00:43.926 --> 00:00:47.427
that the Grim Reaper
will come along and take you.

00:00:47.707 --> 00:00:49.587
No, it's not.

00:00:49.757 --> 00:00:55.107
It's much more like what the man thinks,
"I thought, it was going to be my mom."

00:00:55.487 --> 00:00:59.358
Actually, our data shows
that probably, it will be your mom,

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:01.678
or a group of dead relatives,

00:01:01.678 --> 00:01:03.338
happy dead relatives,

00:01:03.338 --> 00:01:05.178
who come to collect you.

00:01:06.188 --> 00:01:10.117
So, what do we really know about dying?

00:01:12.757 --> 00:01:17.128
In the 1970s, Raymond Moody
published a book.

00:01:17.508 --> 00:01:19.657
This was a fantastic book.

00:01:20.057 --> 00:01:24.087
Told wonderful stories
about people in America,

00:01:24.737 --> 00:01:26.968
who, after a cardiac arrest, came back,

00:01:26.968 --> 00:01:32.199
with having gone down a tunnel,
having met a beam of light,

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:33.379
all that sort of thing.

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:36.449
Oh, come on, had to be rubbish.

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:43.809
This was California, that would
never cross over to the UK, no.

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.829
So you can imagine my surprise,
when into my consulting room,

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.879
came a guy who had had a failed catheter,
a cardiac catheter,

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:56.210
and had a near-death experience.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.809
It was my moment of realization
that, in fact, these things did happen,

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:04.829
but it was much more important than that.

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.660
If what this guy was saying was true,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.160
then we could start thinking about
what death might actually mean.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.239
And so, I had to start studying
and looking into death.

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:22.780
First of all, this was
the near-death experience.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.330
Now I found, it did occur in England.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.540
I went into various hospitals
and spoke to people,

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.391
and so I appeared on the BBC
and two films in the 1980s,

00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:42.340
and I got over one thousand,
no two thousand letters.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.550
Do you remember letters? 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.870
They are rather fun, you can read them.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.200
(Laughter)

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.526
Well, these letters were written by people

00:02:51.526 --> 00:02:57.901
who had never ever before
told anyone about their experiences.

00:02:58.201 --> 00:03:00.690
"Why?" I said, "Too frightened."

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.442
They told it to their wives
or their husbands,

00:03:03.442 --> 00:03:05.311
they weren't interested.

00:03:05.311 --> 00:03:08.351
They told it to their friends,
they said, "You're mad."

00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:12.341
They were very relieved
to be able to put them down on paper,

00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:17.092
and I was very pleased because I could
then study these and understand

00:03:17.092 --> 00:03:20.282
what the near-death experience was about.

00:03:20.552 --> 00:03:23.492
What we found is that it was, in fact,

00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:28.022
very similar to that suggested
by Raymond Moody.

00:03:28.882 --> 00:03:32.802
First of all, you lose
your pain - if you're in pain.

00:03:33.082 --> 00:03:35.272
Then you become very calm.

00:03:35.272 --> 00:03:40.302
And then some people leave their body,
others will go down a tunnel,

00:03:40.582 --> 00:03:45.452
a fascinating tunnel, it varies,
and at the end of the tunnel,

00:03:45.452 --> 00:03:47.342
there's a speck of light.

00:03:47.342 --> 00:03:49.632
If you can move towards
the speck of light,

00:03:49.632 --> 00:03:52.583
it gets bigger and bigger,
very, very bright.

00:03:52.583 --> 00:03:54.983
When you come into the speck of light,

00:03:54.983 --> 00:03:59.672
it envelops you
as a full light experience.

00:04:00.222 --> 00:04:04.053
And it's calming, compassionate,

00:04:04.053 --> 00:04:07.913
loving, supportive, amazing.

00:04:08.273 --> 00:04:11.004
And in the light,
there is the being of light.

00:04:11.404 --> 00:04:14.573
And the being of light
may speak to you, may not.

00:04:14.843 --> 00:04:20.053
What you do then
is that you may get a life review.

00:04:20.053 --> 00:04:22.743
You come out of the light,
you may get a life review.

00:04:22.743 --> 00:04:28.614
Very interesting because you can
then see exactly what you've done before,

00:04:28.614 --> 00:04:34.484
and review all the things you've done
and understand why you did them.

00:04:35.504 --> 00:04:41.294
Then you will go into a space,
and the space is usually, in our culture,

00:04:41.294 --> 00:04:44.164
in the UK, is an English country garden.

00:04:44.164 --> 00:04:45.914
Oh come on, it's lovely.

00:04:45.914 --> 00:04:47.374
(Laughter)

00:04:47.374 --> 00:04:50.374
Beautiful flowers, birdsong.

00:04:51.564 --> 00:04:52.585
I can tell you

00:04:52.585 --> 00:04:57.285
that no spiders, no snakes etc.
have ever been seen there.

00:04:57.645 --> 00:04:59.404
So, it's a wonderful experience.

00:04:59.404 --> 00:05:02.958
And walking around the garden,
are dead relatives.

00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.538
They will greet you.

00:05:04.898 --> 00:05:06.979
Some of them will send you back.

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:12.474
And you will come to a point
where you know it's a border of some sort

00:05:12.474 --> 00:05:14.975
and if you cross it,
then you won't return.

00:05:15.685 --> 00:05:19.734
This is important because at that point,
you have to make a decision:

00:05:19.734 --> 00:05:24.114
you're going to go on and never come back,
or you are going to return.

00:05:24.114 --> 00:05:25.945
Some people decide to return

00:05:25.945 --> 00:05:29.446
because they've got a family,
kids, that sort of thing.

00:05:29.446 --> 00:05:33.826
Others are sent back
by the being of light.

00:05:33.826 --> 00:05:38.862
And others, the relatives will say,
"Go back. It's not your time yet."

00:05:39.142 --> 00:05:45.686
So, the people then find themselves
back in the hospital.

00:05:46.716 --> 00:05:50.186
Now, what sort of things
cause the near-death experience?

00:05:50.186 --> 00:05:54.976
Well, illness, operations,
accidents, all those sorts of things.

00:05:54.976 --> 00:05:59.136
But that is not terribly helpful to us,

00:05:59.576 --> 00:06:03.676
because you cannot study
the brain function of these people,

00:06:03.676 --> 00:06:06.527
if you take them
from accidents or childbirth.

00:06:06.527 --> 00:06:08.317
You see, it's all different.

00:06:08.317 --> 00:06:14.228
So, what you have to do is to try
and get the brain in the same state.

00:06:14.578 --> 00:06:18.377
Now, heart attacks is the obvious one.

00:06:18.397 --> 00:06:23.219
In a heart attack, the heart
is stopped, obviously, no respiration,

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:26.297
and the brainstem reflexes have all gone.

00:06:26.677 --> 00:06:29.027
So, you are clinically dead.

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:31.617
So, we know what state the brain is in.

00:06:31.947 --> 00:06:38.548
And so, it makes a very, very good model
for looking at near-death experiences.

00:06:38.748 --> 00:06:41.538
In our sample, we had about
nine percent of people

00:06:41.538 --> 00:06:45.090
who had their near-death experiences
during their heart attack.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.568
Now, was this really true?

00:06:47.568 --> 00:06:50.138
Could we see it in hospital?

00:06:50.428 --> 00:06:53.238
So we set up a study
in Southampton Hospital,

00:06:53.238 --> 00:06:57.028
looked at 69 people
who had had a cardiac arrest

00:06:57.028 --> 00:07:00.508
and found just under
nine percent of people

00:07:00.508 --> 00:07:02.288
who had had a near-death experience.

00:07:02.288 --> 00:07:03.178
What was it like?

00:07:03.178 --> 00:07:05.058
Now, we could actually look at it.

00:07:05.058 --> 00:07:06.898
Very similar to the ones we'd seen?

00:07:06.898 --> 00:07:12.559
Yes, it does occur in cardiac arrest.

00:07:12.829 --> 00:07:16.269
Now, if that's true, when does it occur?

00:07:16.549 --> 00:07:18.669
You see, the NDEers say,

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:21.614
the experience occurs
when you're unconscious.

00:07:21.614 --> 00:07:26.284
Now, if that's true,
that you can get these experiences

00:07:26.284 --> 00:07:28.980
when you're unconscious
and the brain isn't functioning,

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.589
then it would makes a very good model
for the beginnings of death.

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:39.209
Science says, "This is impossible,
it is ridiculous: Fenwick, go home!"

00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:44.539
Because the argument is that consciousness

00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:46.379
is created by the brain.

00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:49.559
So if I'm saying to you
the brain isn't functioning

00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:51.389
and there's consciousness there,

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:55.690
it doesn't fit easily
into our modern scientific paradigm.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.240
So we had a little look further at this.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:05.430
I've drawn you a cartoon
as to what happens to consciousness

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.640
when the heart stops.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.510
You see, the consciousness
is high at the beginning.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:16.131
Heart stops, there's a rapid fall
in consciousness to unconsciousness.

00:08:16.151 --> 00:08:18.540
So the experience can't happen then.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:22.521
When the heart restarts, it's confusional.

00:08:23.131 --> 00:08:26.581
People don't know where they are,
what's happening, that sort of thing.

00:08:26.581 --> 00:08:31.391
But the near-death experience
is very, very lucid, very clear.

00:08:31.981 --> 00:08:36.842
And so this confusional arousal
means it can't happen then.

00:08:36.842 --> 00:08:38.652
So when does it happen?

00:08:38.652 --> 00:08:43.180
They say - that's the NDEers -
it happens when they're unconscious.

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:49.991
So we argue that possibly they're correct
and that this is the time this happens.

00:08:49.991 --> 00:08:51.681
You have to understand

00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:54.952
that that's against
our current understanding in science

00:08:54.952 --> 00:08:59.752
but nevertheless run with the data,
don't run with the current model,

00:08:59.752 --> 00:09:01.592
if it seems to be wrong.

00:09:01.972 --> 00:09:07.713
Now if what I've told you is correct,
then it means the near-death experience

00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:10.402
is a good model for the dying process.

00:09:10.402 --> 00:09:12.012
You'd all agree with that.

00:09:12.012 --> 00:09:17.812
So let's look at dying
and see what it's like.

00:09:17.812 --> 00:09:19.433
So what we did

00:09:19.863 --> 00:09:26.263
is we went into nursing homes, hospices.

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:29.983
We talked to palliative care teams.

00:09:29.983 --> 00:09:33.719
We did this in the UK,
we did it in Holland,

00:09:33.719 --> 00:09:36.768
and our questionnaire has been given
to people in Ireland.

00:09:37.258 --> 00:09:44.113
We've come up with a lot of ideas
about what actually happens when you die.

00:09:44.373 --> 00:09:50.114
But much more than that, I went on radio,
and television, and got stories.

00:09:50.114 --> 00:09:55.543
I got over 1,500 stories about
what people say happens when you die.

00:09:56.333 --> 00:09:58.294
So what I'm going to do now

00:09:58.294 --> 00:10:03.633
is tell you some of these stories
about what happens when you die.

00:10:04.163 --> 00:10:07.793
And so we're going to start
with the first stage,

00:10:07.793 --> 00:10:10.384
and that is premonitions.

00:10:10.384 --> 00:10:14.544
So here's a story about somebody
who had a premonition.

00:10:14.544 --> 00:10:17.294
A premonition means
that you know you are going to die.

00:10:19.844 --> 00:10:24.974
"I was puzzled when my husband,
who is a young man in good health,

00:10:25.304 --> 00:10:28.665
suddenly started to put
all his affairs in order."

00:10:28.745 --> 00:10:30.834
So he's young, he's got a family.

00:10:31.314 --> 00:10:35.464
"Wrote his will, and told me,
he was going to die.

00:10:36.164 --> 00:10:38.054
I laughed it off.

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:43.625
But three months later, he was making
a routine flight and the plane crashed."

00:10:44.485 --> 00:10:49.065
So he did, in fact, die and it seems
as if that was a warning for him.

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:53.540
He also said that he completed everything
he had come for to this world.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.545
Although I'm not sure that I understand
exactly what that means.

00:10:57.135 --> 00:10:58.956
So let's make a picture.

00:10:59.196 --> 00:11:02.515
You see premonitions
on the left-hand side of your screen.

00:11:02.515 --> 00:11:07.566
That is the first stage in coming to die.

00:11:08.186 --> 00:11:13.876
Now, another very frequent occurrence
is deathbed visions.

00:11:14.016 --> 00:11:18.346
They're actually in all cultures,
they are not specific to our culture.

00:11:19.016 --> 00:11:23.426
The content of them tends to go
with culture to some extent

00:11:23.426 --> 00:11:26.426
but in our culture
they're totally fascinating.

00:11:27.576 --> 00:11:31.456
What usually happens
is that the dead relative

00:11:31.456 --> 00:11:36.756
comes into the room where you are
and they will talk to you.

00:11:36.756 --> 00:11:39.386
They're very supportive, very helpful.

00:11:39.386 --> 00:11:42.337
They say, they're going
to be with you when you die.

00:11:42.727 --> 00:11:45.072
So here's a story,

00:11:46.782 --> 00:11:51.662
just to remind you,
do you all know that Giotto fresco?

00:11:52.792 --> 00:11:55.937
Don't the men all wish
that they were St. Francis,

00:11:55.937 --> 00:11:59.078
getting those lovely angels
to come and look after them.

00:11:59.658 --> 00:12:02.227
Well, we're not St. Francis.

00:12:02.227 --> 00:12:05.767
Here's the sort of things,
the sort of stories we get:

00:12:06.557 --> 00:12:11.238
"She spent around four hours
talking to two men,"

00:12:11.238 --> 00:12:13.038
- this is in a hospice -

00:12:13.038 --> 00:12:16.607
"shifting her gaze between
two different spots in the room.

00:12:16.907 --> 00:12:20.447
One of them was her brother
who had died the previous year,

00:12:20.447 --> 00:12:25.669
and the other was one somebody older,
perhaps her grandfather.

00:12:25.959 --> 00:12:29.457
During this whole time,
she was very animated, happy,

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:33.148
and extremely lucid,
unlike the rest of the time.

00:12:33.728 --> 00:12:37.238
The conversation ended
with her waving goodbye to them."

00:12:37.238 --> 00:12:38.430
Now, who sees these?

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:42.178
Well, the dying, obviously,
sometimes the relatives,

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:46.959
more often children,
very occasionally the hospice staff.

00:12:46.959 --> 00:12:49.839
So they tend to be
mainly seen by the dying.

00:12:50.289 --> 00:12:53.109
So we can put next deathbed visions.

00:12:53.109 --> 00:12:55.959
But one thing you must know,
and do remember this,

00:12:55.959 --> 00:12:59.049
is that some of them say
that they're going to come back

00:12:59.049 --> 00:13:02.479
on a particular day to help you
with the dying process,

00:13:02.479 --> 00:13:04.160
to help you cross the border.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.079
And if you know that, you can ask them

00:13:07.079 --> 00:13:09.269
if they'd probably come back
a few days later.

00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:13.529
You can negotiate with them,
not because you want to go to a party,

00:13:13.529 --> 00:13:14.869
or do something like that,

00:13:14.869 --> 00:13:19.929
but because a member of the family
who isn't there and is coming,

00:13:19.929 --> 00:13:22.430
and they will wait for that.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:25.830
So the next thing, well,
not the next thing

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:31.603
but another thing which happens is, to me,
one of the most interesting things of all.

00:13:31.603 --> 00:13:34.851
Do you remember I was telling you
about this area people go into

00:13:34.851 --> 00:13:37.010
with love, light, and compassion?

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.161
Well, this is exactly what we find.

00:13:39.161 --> 00:13:43.741
Some people are in and out
of what they call "another reality."

00:13:43.741 --> 00:13:45.589
What's the reality like?

00:13:45.589 --> 00:13:48.460
Very like the one
which I've been describing to you.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.558
Except this time,
there are spiritual beings,

00:13:50.558 --> 00:13:53.640
there are dead relatives,
they all say to you

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.182
that they're going
to help you cross when you die.

00:13:57.832 --> 00:14:02.592
And so here is the sort of thing,
the sort of story we get:

00:14:04.342 --> 00:14:07.792
"My father was at his father's bedside,

00:14:07.792 --> 00:14:12.521
deeply distressed, but my grandfather
quietly said to my father,

00:14:12.961 --> 00:14:15.571
'Don't worry, Leslie, I'm alright.

00:14:15.571 --> 00:14:18.131
I can see in here
the most beautiful things,

00:14:18.131 --> 00:14:19.992
and you must not worry.'

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:23.011
And he quietly died lucid to the end."

00:14:23.371 --> 00:14:25.212
So that's very helpful, isn't it?

00:14:25.212 --> 00:14:29.251
It isn't, in fact, this horrid blackness
that you're all thinking of.

00:14:29.251 --> 00:14:31.482
It's really quite different from that.

00:14:34.702 --> 00:14:37.753
So this is an example
of the alternate reality.

00:14:37.753 --> 00:14:44.402
They describe it as very beautiful,
flowers everywhere, light, and love.

00:14:46.042 --> 00:14:50.043
So let's come on now to death itself.

00:14:52.803 --> 00:14:56.892
And death is a totally fascinating time.

00:14:57.942 --> 00:15:00.418
The things that happen are quite amazing.

00:15:00.418 --> 00:15:03.672
One of the things is it shows
our connectedness,

00:15:04.812 --> 00:15:07.634
or our interconnectedness.

00:15:07.634 --> 00:15:13.820
And deathbed coincidences
are one of the major features.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.714
In a deathbed coincidence,

00:15:15.714 --> 00:15:19.744
the dying person, in our samples,
within half an hour of death,

00:15:19.744 --> 00:15:24.603
but mainly at the time of death,
will go and contact somebody

00:15:24.603 --> 00:15:29.534
with whom they are emotionally connected,
somebody who couldn't be with them

00:15:29.534 --> 00:15:32.005
when they were dying,
or somebody they know very well

00:15:32.005 --> 00:15:33.724
and want to say goodbye to.

00:15:34.834 --> 00:15:39.274
Here's just such a story,
and see if you like it:

00:15:39.754 --> 00:15:44.654
"Father told me that he awoke
during the night to see a column of light

00:15:44.654 --> 00:15:46.635
at the end of his bed.

00:15:47.015 --> 00:15:51.845
As he watches, the column
of light opens and his son appears

00:15:51.845 --> 00:15:55.105
to say he is dead but alright.

00:15:56.115 --> 00:16:02.596
He says, 'Goodbye,' re-enters the light
which then slowly fades."

00:16:03.006 --> 00:16:04.721
Quite often, you get a message.

00:16:04.721 --> 00:16:06.735
The one I've given you is in a dream.

00:16:06.735 --> 00:16:08.535
They're lucid, they're narrative.

00:16:08.535 --> 00:16:10.014
But if you were awake,

00:16:10.014 --> 00:16:15.424
you feel it as something
very important has happened.

00:16:15.424 --> 00:16:16.953
You have to go and telephone.

00:16:16.953 --> 00:16:20.809
Sometimes the person
will give you a message themselves

00:16:21.219 --> 00:16:24.006
when you're awake,
but that's not quite so common.

00:16:24.006 --> 00:16:26.996
It's usually a very strong
emotional feeling.

00:16:27.656 --> 00:16:32.636
So then let's consider what actually
happens at the time of death,

00:16:32.636 --> 00:16:34.775
and why I say it's so interesting.

00:16:34.775 --> 00:16:36.225
Clocks stop.

00:16:36.565 --> 00:16:39.876
I don't know if in Germany you have
the song "My grandfather's clock".

00:16:39.876 --> 00:16:44.696
I don't think you do, which stopped dead
never to go again when the old man died.

00:16:45.256 --> 00:16:50.045
Well, mechanical clocks do stop,
watches stop, showing the time of death.

00:16:50.045 --> 00:16:52.795
Do electronic ones stop? Yes, they do.

00:16:52.795 --> 00:16:54.616
We have stories of all of these.

00:16:54.616 --> 00:16:58.666
So there is some relationship
between the clock and the person.

00:16:58.666 --> 00:16:59.915
Animals.

00:17:01.335 --> 00:17:04.408
If you have a close relationship
with your animal,

00:17:04.838 --> 00:17:07.137
and they're at a distance, say at home,

00:17:07.137 --> 00:17:11.336
then quite often, at the time
of your death, they will respond.

00:17:11.336 --> 00:17:13.187
We had a lovely story.

00:17:13.667 --> 00:17:16.217
Here you can see Fluke, a black Labrador,

00:17:16.217 --> 00:17:20.037
and here you can see Derek;
they had a very close relationship.

00:17:20.977 --> 00:17:25.238
Fluke died five years before Derek died,

00:17:25.718 --> 00:17:28.128
and in the last few days,

00:17:29.228 --> 00:17:35.368
Fluke was seen by Derek
in the hospice room where he was dying.

00:17:35.618 --> 00:17:38.677
His wife wrote in her letter
that she very much hoped

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:43.108
that Fluke would be there
to help Derek with his crossing.

00:17:44.048 --> 00:17:47.458
Now, one of the most
fascinating things to me is light,

00:17:47.788 --> 00:17:50.168
light at the time of death.

00:17:50.388 --> 00:17:55.648
Now, you get radiant light
which shines from the person all around

00:17:55.648 --> 00:18:00.628
and may be seen shining
outside the hospice room.

00:18:00.898 --> 00:18:05.537
At the time of death, the person
may get transformed by light,

00:18:06.087 --> 00:18:10.238
and you can see light in the room.

00:18:10.238 --> 00:18:14.189
If you happen to be caught
in the light, or go into it again,

00:18:14.189 --> 00:18:17.529
it has this spiritual quality
of love and compassion to it.

00:18:18.019 --> 00:18:22.869
Here's a nice story which was told to me
by a hospice chaplain.

00:18:23.709 --> 00:18:28.248
"Sometimes I've seen a light
which is ina corner,

00:18:29.428 --> 00:18:31.098
like candle light.

00:18:31.438 --> 00:18:35.249
It's a golden light,
it's not electric light.

00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:38.979
It's not one of the hospice lights.

00:18:40.069 --> 00:18:44.439
It's like candlelight,
and it just appears sometimes.

00:18:45.589 --> 00:18:47.838
It goes when they die.

00:18:48.528 --> 00:18:52.158
They take their last breath,
as everything settles down,

00:18:53.078 --> 00:18:54.648
the light goes out."

00:18:55.258 --> 00:18:58.549
So these things do happen.

00:18:59.329 --> 00:19:02.539
Now what do we mean
by having a "good death?"

00:19:03.089 --> 00:19:08.050
Having a good death means
that you actually know what you want.

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:12.880
This is why it's so important
that you all have listened to what I said.

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.020
Do you really want this?

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.509
Do you?

00:19:18.869 --> 00:19:22.280
Tied up in pipes, and tubes, and wires.

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:24.210
It's not a spiritual setting.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:27.610
It's not somewhere where you can relax
into the death process.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:30.111
They don't have time for you.

00:19:30.151 --> 00:19:33.299
They're keeping the living alive,
so what are you doing there?

00:19:33.671 --> 00:19:37.181
So make certain
that doesn't happen to you.

00:19:37.481 --> 00:19:41.940
But death at home or hospice
is, I think, a good death.

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:43.971
It's like this:

00:19:44.011 --> 00:19:48.251
When you get spiritual care
and where the relatives can visit,

00:19:48.251 --> 00:19:51.952
but much more important,
where the grandchildren can visit.

00:19:52.422 --> 00:19:55.612
They can even play about on your bed
if you're not too ill.

00:19:56.052 --> 00:20:02.362
So it's really important that you see
that death is part of life.

00:20:02.772 --> 00:20:03.732
It is.

00:20:04.102 --> 00:20:06.511
To lead a good life
is to have a good death.

00:20:07.191 --> 00:20:10.321
So then, what have I been saying?

00:20:10.321 --> 00:20:13.552
In a nutshell, prepare for a good death.

00:20:14.312 --> 00:20:18.171
Teach people, including children,
not to be afraid of dying.

00:20:18.171 --> 00:20:20.962
Many of you will have kids,
many of the kids have hamsters,

00:20:20.962 --> 00:20:22.622
many of the hamsters die.

00:20:22.622 --> 00:20:26.091
Use this as an opportunity
to tell them about death.

00:20:27.141 --> 00:20:30.272
Learn what may happen
to you when you die.

00:20:30.942 --> 00:20:32.672
Prepare for death,

00:20:33.082 --> 00:20:36.492
and don't just clean out your attic
but clear up your relationships.

00:20:36.492 --> 00:20:39.623
And do remember this, and that is,

00:20:40.743 --> 00:20:45.210
one of the most difficult things of death
are relationships within the family

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.523
which are stressful.

00:20:46.523 --> 00:20:48.457
It makes for a very stressful death.

00:20:48.457 --> 00:20:51.218
So don't do it, sort it out beforehand.

00:20:51.738 --> 00:20:53.087
Discuss death,

00:20:53.087 --> 00:20:55.573
and don't sweep it under the carpet.

00:20:57.413 --> 00:21:01.842
The final border may not be
as frightening as you think.

00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:03.492
So don't be afraid.

00:21:04.732 --> 00:21:08.242
Now, the important thing
about that is, all you guys,

00:21:08.242 --> 00:21:09.800
or some of you guys will say,

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.403
"Well, I'm not sure
I really believe this man."

00:21:12.983 --> 00:21:14.534
Ask your friends.

00:21:14.534 --> 00:21:17.504
I'm going to do an experiment
now with you all.

00:21:17.984 --> 00:21:19.616
I want to know

00:21:19.616 --> 00:21:24.164
how many of you have encountered,
or had near-death experiences?

00:21:24.334 --> 00:21:29.714
I want to know how many of you have,
in fact, had an experience with a relative

00:21:29.714 --> 00:21:34.994
who has had the sort of things
that I'm talking about, do you understand?

00:21:35.404 --> 00:21:40.283
So anybody who has heard a story,
of any of those dimensions,

00:21:40.283 --> 00:21:41.894
I want you to put your hand up.

00:21:41.894 --> 00:21:44.564
I'm told that German audiences
sometimes don't.

00:21:44.564 --> 00:21:45.774
OK, put your hands up.

00:21:46.244 --> 00:21:47.954
Wow, look at that!

00:21:48.894 --> 00:21:52.124
And they say these things don't happen.

00:21:52.614 --> 00:21:55.314
Thank you all for doing that.

00:21:55.824 --> 00:22:01.535
So now, let me just talk a little bit

00:22:01.535 --> 00:22:04.055
about the final border for you.

00:22:04.245 --> 00:22:06.005
I have chosen two stories.

00:22:06.635 --> 00:22:10.905
The great inventor Edison,
just hours before his death,

00:22:11.295 --> 00:22:17.944
emerged from a coma, opened his eyes,
looked upwards and said,

00:22:19.294 --> 00:22:21.715
"It is very beautiful over there."

00:22:22.505 --> 00:22:24.304
OK? Just before he died.

00:22:24.914 --> 00:22:29.375
And this one, you all know,
but I want you to take part in it

00:22:29.375 --> 00:22:31.535
just to show that you understand.

00:22:32.315 --> 00:22:35.306
Steve Jobs, according to his sister,

00:22:35.306 --> 00:22:39.396
as he died, Steve Jobs
looked into the middle distance

00:22:39.396 --> 00:22:45.476
and said in wonder, "Wow, wow!"

00:22:45.476 --> 00:22:49.676
Now, to show me that you
understand what I've been saying,

00:22:49.676 --> 00:22:51.775
you've got this message of hope,

00:22:51.775 --> 00:22:55.876
I want you all to join with me
on the third "Wow."

00:22:55.936 --> 00:22:57.765
I'm going to count up to three.

00:22:57.765 --> 00:23:00.084
One, two, three, wow. OK, ready?

00:23:00.084 --> 00:23:02.964
One, two, three:

00:23:02.964 --> 00:23:04.726
(Audience): "Wow!"

00:23:04.726 --> 00:23:06.286
Peter Fenwick: Hey!

00:23:06.286 --> 00:23:08.726
(Applause)
