00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.039
In Game of Thrones Season 7, we learn that
Jon Snow’s real name is Aegon Targaryen

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:11.769
. He’s the son of Rhaegar Targaryen , which
means Daenerys is Jon’s aunt – yes, Jon

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:13.839
has sex with his aunt.

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:15.000
Rhaegar’s dead now.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.900
So’s Viserys Targaryen, and Aerys and Aemon
Targaryen.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.160
In the books, there’s still Bloodraven,
a Targaryen bastard, and Young Griff, who

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.289
claims to be Targaryen.

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.000
But Brynden’s a tree , and Griff might be
fake – go watch those videos.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.160
So really, Daenerys and Jon are the last Targaryens
– last of the dynasty that ruled Westeros

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.930
for centuries, and last of the dragonlords
of Valyria .

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.891
Valyria was an empire that ruled half the
world for thousands of years, until, four

00:00:44.891 --> 00:00:47.700
hundred years ago, it exploded.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.030
This was the Doom of Valyria, and it’s a
mystery, connecting to magic, Faceless Men,

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.650
Lannister gold, and the legacy of Daenerys
and Jon’s family.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.990
So Valyria was a peninsula to the east of
Westeros.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.840
Thousands of years ago , the Valyrians were
shepherds among volcanic mountains called

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.460
the Fourteen Flames – until they discovered
dragons, and trained them as weapons of war

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.920
. At the time, the area was dominated by geese
– by Old Ghis, an empire built on slavery

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.250
. So the Valyrians and their dragons conquered
the Ghiscari , and took them as their own

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.840
slaves . The Valyrians expanded , building
an empire across most the known world . They

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.060
called themselves the Freehold, cause all
landowners had a say in government – but

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.190
wherever they conquered, the Freehold took
slaves , sending thousands down the Fourteen

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:44.039
Flames to mine for gold and silver . Valyria
had advanced technology and magic . They used

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.799
dragonflame to shape stone into beautiful
towers . They made Valyrian steel swords , long

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.229
roads , and colonies – Valyria’s like
ancient Rome, just with dragons . And with

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.360
incest – the dragonlords traditionally married
their own siblings.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.109
They believed they were “descended from
dragons” , and wanted to keep their “blood”

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:08.450
“pure” . The dragonlords lived in the
capital city of Valyria, using magic and politics

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.710
in an endless struggle for “power and glory”.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.870
Valyria was the “center of civilization”
– until the Doom came.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.610
Every hill in Valyria erupted with fire, smoke
and lava, so hot that dragons were burned

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.920
from the sky.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.190
The earth cracked open and swallowed whole
towns.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.510
Lakes boiled and the sea flooded in.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.010
The clouds rained obsidian and “black blood”.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.670
Within hours, the whole peninsula was “shattered”
, the empire gone . All Valyria’s knowledge

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.950
and technology, like how to make Valyrian
steel, was lost . The only dragonlords to

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.180
survive this Doom were the Targaryens, who
had left Valyria years earlier, because Daenys

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.100
Targaryen foresaw the Doom in a dream . So
these Targaryens, the ancestors of Daenerys

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.860
and Jon, settled on Dragonstone, and would
later conquer Westeros.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.021
Now, four hundred years after the Doom, Valyria
is a “smoking ruin” , “accursed” , and

00:03:07.021 --> 00:03:11.960
“demon-haunted” . In the show, Tyrion
and Jorah visit the ruins and survive, but

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.690
in the books – no one returns from Valyria.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.820
Whole fleets and armies have disappeared there,
including Tyrion’s uncle, Gerion Lannister

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.710
. Euron Greyjoy claims to have been there
, but he might be lying . Whether the danger

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:32.530
is demons, or toxic volcanic fumes, the place
is dangerous – the Doom still rules Valyria

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.780
. But what was the Doom, and what caused it?

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.350
The Doom might have been a natural volcanic
eruption – author George Martin compared

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.730
the Doom to the eruption of Krakatoa, and
the fall of Pompeii.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.910
But Valyria, he says, involved magic . Valyria
is a place of fire magic – it's got dragons,

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.940
and volcanoes, it’s called the “Lands
of the Long Summer” . Compare that with

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.590
far north Westeros, called the Lands of Always
Winter – which has white walkers, and ice

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.590
magic.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.340
These two places seem like centres of ice
and fire in this world – maybe they're connected

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.320
to the irregular seasons.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.370
The north had an icy disaster in the Long
Night, and Valyria had a fiery disaster in

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.560
the Doom – and this affected the world's
magic.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.430
“when the Doom fell on Valyria”, “Magic
… died in the west” – it’s only recently

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:30.070
returning . So the point is that Valyria had
some serious cosmic elemental magick happening

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.419
– and the Valyrians fucked with it.

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.030
The Valyrians were sorcerers , and for thousands
of years, they used “spells” to “tame”

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.289
the Fourteen Flames . But at the same time,
they mined the Flames for gold and silver

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:49.889
. These were volcanoes full of magma and “firewyrms”,
and slaves were killed by the hundreds.

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:55.630
And yet they kept mining, deeper and deeper
, like some Khazad-Dûm shit – in Lord of

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.219
the Rings, the dwarves of Moria “delved
too greedily and too deep”, and they awoke

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:06.010
the fiery balrog . Maybe Valyria is similar
– they got too greedy, “delved too deep”,

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.259
and set off the Fourteen Flames . Cause that’s
what happens when you mess with magic in this

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:16.770
world – we’re told over and over that
magic’s dangerous . The Valyrians in their

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.449
arrogance thought they could control it, but
it blew up in their face.

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:27.569
So now their ruins stand like Ozymandias or
Atlantis – a warning against hubris, and

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:30.560
the mining of magic volcanoes.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.870
But there’s still more to the story.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.749
In Book 4, Arya joins the Faceless Men – a
cult of assassins who worship death . She’s

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:43.930
trained by “the kindly man”, who tells
her that the Faceless Men began in Valyria,

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.460
among the slaves who mined the Fourteen Flames
. He says the slaves suffered so badly in

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.449
the mines that they wished for death . [] The
first Faceless Man gave the “gift” of

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:58.730
death to a slave . Arya argues that the man
“should have killed the” Valyrian slave

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.659
masters instead . And he replies that the
Faceless “would bring the gift to them as

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:09.020
well … but that is a tale for another day”
. [] So this is a hint that the Faceless Men

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.810
caused the Doom of Valyria . Which makes sense
– the Men arose from Valyrian slaves, and

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:20.099
they’re now based in Braavos, which was
founded by ex-slaves escaping Valyria . And

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:25.550
the Faceless worship death, so killing thousands
in a Doom is probably their idea of a good

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:26.550
time.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.499
But how could the Faceless cause the Doom?

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:34.500
One theory is that they used dragon eggs – at
Summerhall, it seems that dragon eggs caused

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:40.219
a deadly fire . Maybe the Faceless used lots
of eggs to set off the Fourteen Flames.

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:44.680
But there’s another possibility that ties
in to a prophecy.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.009
The worldbook says that Valyrian “sorcerers
foretold that the gold of Casterly Rock would

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:51.389
destroy them”.

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:55.800
Casterly Rock is home to the Lannisters, who
were famous for their gold mines , even in

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.910
Valyrian times.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.819
[] But for some reason, the Valyrians never
contacted the rich Lannisters, even though

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:05.759
they were so hungry for gold that they were
mining volcanoes.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:10.960
Maybe the Valyrians avoided the Lannisters
because of this prophecy . [] But the Lannisters

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.909
back then really wanted a Valyrian steel sword
– all the cool Westerosi families had one,

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:20.129
like Stark’s Ice, and Tarly’s Heartsbane.

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:25.189
[] So “in the century before the Doom”
the Lannisters bought the Valyrian sword Brightroar

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:30.850
for a huge amount of “gold” . We don’t
know who sold Brightroar to the Lannisters,

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:36.490
but if this gold went to Valyria it could’ve
fulfilled the prophecy of Valyria’s destruction.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.810
How could gold cause the Doom?

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:45.229
The great families of Valyria were in “constant”
“conflict” . Sometimes they assassinated

00:07:45.229 --> 00:07:49.249
each other – which was a problem, cause
some of these Valyrians were sorcerers whose

00:07:49.249 --> 00:07:54.860
spells held back the Fourteen Flames . The
worldbook suggests that too many sorcerers

00:07:54.860 --> 00:08:00.000
were assassinated, so the spells failed, and
that’s why the Doom happened . Maybe these

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.100
assassinations were carried out by the assassins
of the Faceless Men . But the Faceless don’t

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:11.530
kill for free – they charge a high price
. So maybe they were paid with that Lannister

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.930
gold that a Valyrian got by selling Brightroar.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:20.199
So the Valyrians were so caught up in their
petty political conflicts that they paid for

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:26.180
their own destruction, giving prophecy gold
to the death cult that arose from their slavery

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.659
and oppression.

00:08:27.659 --> 00:08:34.750
As Tyrion says, Valyria was built on blood
and fire – and they reaped what they’d

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.240
sown .
So that theory brings together all the hints

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.820
from the text – Lannister gold paid for
Faceless assassinations that destabilised

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:47.770
magic and caused the Doom . But you can add
some tinfoil on top.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:52.480
Cause it may be that the Valyrians ordered
these assassinations not knowing they’d

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.610
cause the Doom.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.990
But maybe it was deliberate.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:00.430
Maybe one of these warring families wanted
to wipe out the competition – and be the

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.889
last dragonlords standing.

00:09:02.889 --> 00:09:07.690
We know the Targaryens were a fairly minor
house in Valyria – when they left for Dragonstone,

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:12.800
their rivals thought them cowards . But maybe
the Targaryens ordered these assassinations

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:18.529
to cause the Doom to destroy their enemies
– made up some excuse about a dream, went

00:09:18.529 --> 00:09:24.699
to Dragonstone, and watched their homeland
burn, leaving them the only dragonlords in

00:09:24.699 --> 00:09:31.079
the world , free to be the unopposed rulers
of whatever realm they chose.

00:09:31.079 --> 00:09:37.180
Maybe House Targaryen, Daenerys and Jon’s
family, is founded on a terrible, genocidal

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.779
betrayal.

00:09:38.779 --> 00:09:41.470
But that’s just speculation.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:46.570
Whatever caused the Doom, Valyria has lessons
for its descendants, Daenerys and Jon.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.000
Because the Valyrians were assholes.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.829
They seemed to think that just cause they
were magic and pretty, they could enslave

00:09:52.829 --> 00:09:53.950
the world.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:58.660
They conquered peaceful peoples, and worked
thousands of slaves to death . With their

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:03.649
theories of racial superiority, they’re
basically Nazis with dragons.

00:10:03.649 --> 00:10:08.230
So when they destroyed themselves with their
own “fire and blood”, it’s kinda hard

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.210
to feel sorry for them.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:15.090
Valyrian blood gives Dany and Jon the power
of dragons, magic and prophecy.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:21.389
But the ruins of Valyria should remind them
to use their power with humility and compassion.

00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:25.819
The Doom of Valyria destroyed a whole civilisation’s
knowledge.

00:10:25.819 --> 00:10:29.190
Skills like the forging of Valyrian steel
were lost forever.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:34.410
