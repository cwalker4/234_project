Hey, guys. How are ya? Today's video is
gonna be a little bit different. I wanted

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.210
to talk a little bit about my personal
experience with cholesterol and statin

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:18.090
medication, and I'm gonna start right
after this. Hey guys, welcome to A.D. Keto.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.420
My name is Aaron. This is the channel
where we talk about the ketogenic diet. I

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.170
do some keto food vlogs, talk a little
bit about keto science, and do some keto

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.220
recipes. If this is your first time

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.320
new content. All right, guys. So this is a
video that's been a long time coming. I

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.649
have wanted to do this video for a while. It's about cholesterol, and my personal

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.360
experience with cholesterol. Before I
even get started, I want to make sure you

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.739
guys understand that I am NOT a doctor.
I'm not a medical professional of any

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.360
kind. I'm not trying to give anyone any
medical advice. This is simply my

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.300
experience with the world of high
cholesterol and statin medications. So

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.130
I'm gonna take you guys back a little
while, to about 2010 or so. I went for

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.750
routine blood work. I at this point, I was
at about age 35, 36. And my cholesterol

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.650
came back as pretty high.
It was around 300 total, and my doctor

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.400
put me on atorvastatin medication,
20 milligrams. Atorvastatin is more

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.920
commonly known as Lipitor. It's a very
common cholesterol-lowering medication.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.180
And so I listened to my doctor, and I
went on this medication. And I was on it

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.229
for a while. My cholesterol numbers went
down, and my doctor was very happy. But I

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.740
felt like garbage. My joints hurt, and I
had sort of a brain fog, and I didn't

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.469
even put two and two together. I didn't
even think for a second that it was the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:05.130
atorvastatin that was giving me
these side effects. I just chalked it up

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.270
to me getting older, and getting creakier,
maybe getting a little bit more

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.599
forgetful, but in doing a little bit of
research, I found that these are very

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.050
common side effects
to statin medications in

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.530
general. So I stayed on the medications,
just because my doctor told me to, and I

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.340
was scared to go off them, because I was
afraid that if I my cholesterol got too

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.600
high, I would have a heart attack and die.
So I began to exercise regularly, even

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.720
while on the statin medications. I began
to run 5k races, and I actually built up

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.650
my endurance to the point where I
could run a marathon. I ran and finished

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:54.210
the 2012 Mohawk Hudson marathon, and in training for that marathon, I felt

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.810
terrible. I would run and go out for a
long training run on the weekends, come

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.270
back, and need a day to recover. My body
just hurt so much, and it bummed me out,

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.000
because I really enjoyed running. So I
yo-yoed with my weight for a little

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.220
while. After this marathon, I sort of
started eating poorly. I had a lot of, you

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.700
know, frozen pizzas, and just made bad
choices.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.030
But my cholesterol kind of stayed in
that normal range, because I was still on

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:29.280
the atorvastatin, and then in early 2017,
I sort of had enough yo-yoing and I

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.470
decided to start keto. I found keto
through a friend at work, and tried it

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.490
for a little while, and within a week, was
in love with it, because I felt amazing.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.680
Better than I had in a long time. I
didn't really have much of the keto flu,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.050
maybe a few days, and then I think the
fourth day after I started keto, I can

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.930
remember waking up and feeling like
something was different. Wasn't hungry.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.610
Had a lot of energy. Was becoming fat
adapted. So I decided to stay with it. I

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.830
also decided to drop my statin
medication. And I stopped taking my

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:15.959
statins in January, and got some baseline
blood work done at the time. And then a

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:21.720
few months later, when I went to see my
doctor again, had my blood work done

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.010
again, and my numbers were up, which is what I expected. I expected my cholesterol to

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.430
go up. And he was worried, and really didn't

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.420
know what to do. I told him that I felt
better than I had in years.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:43.440
He wanted me to go back on the statin
meds. I did not. Did not agree. Did not go

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.370
back on them. He said, "let's give it a few more months,

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.290
and see how you're doing then." A few more months went by, and I lost a grand total,

00:04:52.290 --> 00:05:01.110
from the... from January until about July,
I'd lost fifty-something pounds, which he

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.550
was thrilled about. And at this time, when
I got my lipids done, I got what's called

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:13.410
an NMR lipid profile. And NMR stands for a
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. And what that

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:20.520
does is as opposed to a normal lipid
panel, it measures not only your total

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.810
cholesterol, but it actually breaks down
your HDL, your LDL, the number of

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.400
particles, the size of the particles, the
consistency of the particles. It's much

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.660
more information, that gives you a lot
clearer picture of what's going on with

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:42.180
your lipids. And every single marker on
my NMR, outside of my LDL, was sparkling.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.260
Best numbers I'd ever had. My
triglycerides were super-low, my HDL was

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.000
up, all the ratios of HDL-to-total
cholesterol looked good. HDL-to-

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.340
triglycerides looked fantastic. The one number that was still super-high,

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:03.570
even higher, was my LDL. It was up near
300. My GP didn't really know what to

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.760
make of that, so he sent me to a
cardiologist. And the cardiologist ran

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.320
some tests on me. He did an echo... not an
echocardiogram...

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.430
They basically listened to my heart, to
test for abnormalities. Everything was

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:23.970
cool there. They put me on a treadmill, a
stress test, and had me run. I remember I

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.710
had fasted all that day, and told them I
was fasted, and they didn't think I would

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.510
last long, and I ended up going for like
25 minutes. And every five minutes they

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.580
would increase the pace and incline of
the thing. So I ran like an idiot on that

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.930
thing for a while, did well on that, and then
I went for the thing that was very

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.190
excited to go for. The third test that I
went before at the cardiologist's office

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.080
was called a calcium scoring test. And a
calcium scoring test was the granddaddy

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.970
test that I wanted done, because it
doesn't measure for markers that may or

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:03.480
may not be indicative of cardiovascular
disease, like cholesterol. It actually

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.170
measures... it measures ACTUAL heart disease in your

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:12.060
arteries, in your heart, and measures the
actual calcium. And the way that it's

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:17.910
scored is that it starts at zero, and
goes all the way up to a thousand. Zero

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:23.150
being zero risk, there's a zero calcium
in your arteries and heart. A thousand is

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:28.040
"Dear God, how are you still alive?" So
there's a pretty wide spectrum there, and

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:34.230
my score came back as a 14. So I was
hoping for zero, but 14 is still pretty

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:41.760
good, all things considered. And I was
very excited, but my cardiologist wanted

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:49.200
to put me back on a statin. And I refused.
So I stayed on keto, and stayed off the

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.780
statin meds, and dropped another 10
pounds. So by the time November of 2017

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.940
rolled around, I had lost a grand total
of 65 pounds, and I went back in, and had

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.410
some more blood work done. I had an NMR
profile done. Similar numbers came back:

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:08.930
sparkling across the board. Really, really
fantastic numbers, except for that pesky

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:19.020
LDL. And my GP sent me to... referred me to a low-carb doctor. Something that I

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:24.300
didn't even knew existed here in Albany,
in the Albany area. But I went to see

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:29.669
this guy today. He knew what keto was. He knew what

00:08:29.669 --> 00:08:32.640
low-carb was. He knew what it meant to be
fat adapted. I answered a lot of the

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.450
questions he had with answers that I
don't think he expected to hear. Because

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:41.219
I had kind of... I've been doing this for
11 months. I kind of have learned a lot

00:08:41.219 --> 00:08:47.370
of things, and read up on some things, and
knew what I was doing. We...we had a good

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:52.560
conversation about keto and low carb. However, his whole thing is using keto to

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:58.150
transition people to a Mediterranean Diet. He's had a lot of success

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:03.970
getting people on Mediterranean diets,
which is more... less fat, and more protein.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:09.850
And you know, he gave me the line that I
was dreading, that I knew I would

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:13.180
probably hear, is that, "You know keto is
great for when you're just starting out,

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.860
but as far as maintaining, it's not
really something that can get maintained

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:24.520
long term." And I know this to be false.  So
we talked a little bit about my LDL, and

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:30.610
how, you know even though my my calcium
score was good, it wasn't zero. Even

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.880
though all of my numbers look good,
except that LDL, and even though my

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:40.240
weight is where it was when I was 21
years old, he suggested that I get... I eat

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:46.900
fewer marble-y cuts of meat, he suggested
that I lower my saturated fat. When I

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:52.560
told him that I had butter in my coffee,
he looked at me as if I had two heads.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.110
I'm doing a lot of reading about the
lipid system. I've been watching a lot of

00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:01.660
videos about lipids and cholesterol, and
I'll link this right up here, but there's

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:07.300
a video by a guy named Dave Feldman
who's not a doctor, not a medical

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:13.360
professional. He's an engineer. and he has
come at his cholesterol, which is similar

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.650
to mine -- he's what you call a hyper
responder to the keto diet. His LDL shot

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:22.690
up when he started keto. And he's an
engineer, and he came at the problem from

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:28.330
an engineer's perspective, and basically
gave himself... had blood work drawn every

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:33.520
day for I think a month, or two months,
and tracked what he ate over that course

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:39.250
of time, and found some startling and
amazing results, and basically concluded

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:47.110
that the lipid system is SO dynamic and
changeable, that to base anything on such

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:52.780
a changeable system is Crazy Town.
So I'll link it up here again. You should

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:57.130
check out Dave Feldman. There's a couple presentations

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.700
that just kind of blew my mind on
YouTube. And so that's where I am these

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:05.140
days. I am continuing keto. I'm in
maintenance. I'm not going back on

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:09.290
statins,
despite the pressure from every medical

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:16.150
professional in my life to go back on
them, I'm not going on them. Both for

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:22.580
personal reasons, the reasons that I've
said before -- that they... I had some issues

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:27.670
with them, some side effects, some
achiness, some foggyheadedness, that I

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:36.140
don't want to experience again, but also,
a... an institutional reason for not going

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:41.990
back on them. Statins are now the number
one drug in the history of drugs. The

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:46.670
standards for putting someone on statins
have become lower and lower and lower as

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:51.200
time has gone by, and I feel like it's
mostly about money. So while statins

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:56.050
might be lowering my LDL number, I don't
feel like that LDL number being lower

00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:01.450
benefits me in any significant way. So
that's what my...been my experience with

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:06.110
cholesterol and statins.
I appreciate if you've listened to me

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:10.760
ramble for this last 15 minutes or so. I
know that this is not really the kind of

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:15.110
video that I normally do, but I really
wanted to talk about it. I've had some... I

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:20.960
feel pretty strongly about it. And that's
where I am, so... so let me know if any of

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.670
you guys have had similar experiences. I
know that in general, cholesterol does go

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:30.950
up when you start keto, kind of no matter
what, just based on the fact that you're

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:34.820
using fat for energy. Fat is being
mobilized throughout your body more.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.600
Cholesterol is going to show it up in
your blood,

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.690
regardless. But let me know. Let me know
what your experience has been with this

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:46.550
stuff. I'd love to hear from you, love
to chat about it. It's something that I

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:52.490
really needed to talk about, and I hope
it benefits somebody, or hope somebody

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:57.530
can identify with it. And that's gonna
wrap it up for this week, so... so I thank

00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:00.200
you for watching,
please consider subscribing if you

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.459
haven't already. I hope you have a
fantastic day,

00:13:03.459 --> 00:13:10.590
and I will see you next time.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.690
