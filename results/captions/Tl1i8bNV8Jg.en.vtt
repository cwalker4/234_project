00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.660
MATTHEW: Our guest today
is Gavin Newsom.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.780
He is the Lieutenant Governor
of State of California and

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.120
also the Former Mayor of San
Francisco for seven years.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.550
He's always been a longtime
champion of

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.140
innovation and civics.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.460
And also in, I think, social
development, especially

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.800
famously being, when he was
mayor, advocating for same sex

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.570
marriage for a while, even
though it's against the law.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.450
Which is why--

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.920
GAVIN NEWSOM: You don't have
to remind people of that.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.060
MATTHEW: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.009
What you may not know about
Gavin is that he also brought

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.310
universal health care to the
city of San Francisco.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.500
And also, he's been twice
awarded the Most Greenest

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.530
Mayor in America, which
is a big deal.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.460
GAVIN NEWSOM: Thanks.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.760
MATTHEW: But we'll here to talk
about "Citizenville,"

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.530
which is his book that
just came out.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.960
And basically, I want to start
off-- we actually met before

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.700
when you were in the process
of putting together the

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.790
background on this.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.330
And what actually brought
you to write this book?

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.900
Why did you feel the need
to bring technology and

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.580
government together?

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.060
GAVIN NEWSOM: Well, frustration,
my own

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.550
experiences, the reality that
California, in particular,

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.640
when it comes to technology
and governing is on the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.080
leading and cutting
edge of 1973.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.470
And by the way, I literally am
not exaggerating that and I'll

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.110
amplify that point
in a moment.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.800
But also, my own experience
using the tools of technology

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.910
relatively well to get elected,
to amplify people's

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.910
voices, to democratize a
conversation, to engage in a

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.070
two-way conversation, to get
you to show up and not only

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.610
vote but volunteer,
write a check.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.500
And then when the election
was over, we'd

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.590
turn off those voices.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.850
And we'd broadcast for four
years, whereas Matthew and I

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.440
were just saying, three, three
and a half until the election

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.460
starts over again, and
then we engage you.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.640
My own experience reflecting
on the extraordinary 2008

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.560
Obama campaign.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.970
The My Barack Obama effort.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.730
35,000 self-organizing
communities coming together

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.390
and this remarkable opportunity
to, as the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.570
president said, not just
change the players in

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.110
Washington, DC, but to
change the game.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.430
And his effort to continue to
engage those communities

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.986
infamously through a platform
called change.gov.

00:02:07.986 --> 00:02:11.910
And he engaged folks famously
or infamously in a

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.700
conversation that didn't end so
well from the president's

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.290
perspective.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.790
He invited people, these
communities, to come together,

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.260
to continue to have their voices
heard and participate

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.430
in now governing not
just campaigning.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.900
He created this framework and
encouraged people to say

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.060
what's on their mind.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.850
What's your number 1, 2, 3, 4
issues first 100 days of my

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:34.650
administration?

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.560
Is it the war in Iraq?

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.350
It's the war in Afghanistan, war
on terror, climate change

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.190
issues, the financial
meltdown.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.610
What's on your mind?

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.400
And just as Michelle Obama did
two weeks ago at the Academy

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.780
Awards, he came out in a town
hall with people physically

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.310
there and virtually there
and-- envelope, please--

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.620
unveiled the number one priority
on people's minds in

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.120
the United States of America in
2008, just days before the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.440
transition was complete.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.970
And what was it?

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:02.510
MATTHEW: Legalize pot.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.660
GAVIN NEWSOM: Legalizing
marijuana.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.090
And the president
infamously was--

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.960
well, he had a flippant
response.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.990
And the online community
did not take well to

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.130
that flippant response.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.280
And as a consequence--

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.130
Google it--

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.930
see what happened
to change.gov.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.400
It went back for
reconstruction.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.950
It ultimately was transitioned
to the White House website.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.390
The point being it's not easy
to engage in that two-way

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.340
conversation because it might
not necessarily go in a

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.880
direction that you
want it to go.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.540
And so this book is really about
an exploration to bridge

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.480
that gap and to begin to address
the issue of governing

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.820
effectively with technology
and having two-way

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.290
conversations with citizens
and engaging in active

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.810
citizenship as opposed to
citizenship that, from my

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.315
perspective, exists today where
we, frankly, treat you

00:03:51.315 --> 00:03:52.480
as subjects.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.270
Where we do things to you,
but we don't necessarily

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.130
do things with you.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.820
MATTHEW: That's a good theme.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.585
I think we talked before about
everyday democracy.

00:03:59.585 --> 00:04:01.550
And after the election's
over, both the

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.990
electorate is kind of exhausted.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.510
I think we all were after this
last one, as well as the

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.440
politicians when they go back
to their job and actually

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.570
getting things done.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.280
However, that seems like
an old-fashioned model.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.660
So how do we have everyday
democracy?

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.640
People are very busy and only
the extremists on both sides

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.800
will really take active voice
and get involved.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.544
And what kind of tools or ways
can we work to bring people in

00:04:21.544 --> 00:04:24.170
an everyday basis, to get their
opinions brought in, in

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.460
a constructive way though,
so we're not

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.440
just ranting and just--

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.780
the town hall, for example, as a
metaphor is maybe a bad one.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.330
When you think about town halls
usually, some radical--

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.950
you've been to lots
of town halls.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.590
And so you get the person who
wants to come up to the

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.510
microphone and just complain
about this or that.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.520
It's not always the most
important issue of the day.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.620
GAVIN NEWSOM: And that's the
king of the hill concern.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.230
And that's what happened
frankly, with change.gov.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.740
The loudest voices organized
and won.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.260
Marijuana being the
dominant issue.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.610
What about the other issues that
the president rightfully

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.540
noted were significant
as well?

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.390
And you see that in the physical
world in town halls

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.870
that we have all the time where
we claim that's real

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:58.480
engagement.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.480
And we have a budget town hall
where-- truly, I just come

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.070
from my experience as mayor
where we had $6.--

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.810
almost $7 billion budgets, Of
which the entire debate for

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.020
two or three months was around
$20, $25 million.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.070
So talk about a budget that's
baked before we

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.020
reach out to you.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.970
That's 99.9% of the budget's
already been done and we're

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.770
having a big debate
about 0.1%.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.230
And that's public outreach.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.750
That's participatory budgeting
as we know it.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.090
And who shows up at those town
halls if you have the time?

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.570
Usually, the persuasion
industry.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.580
The special interest, folks
with stickers, literally,

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.920
would take over those
town halls.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.880
And if you've been to them, you
sit in the back and you

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.900
go, I got to get out of here.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.690
I can't participate in this.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.040
And so how do we create a
framework where we can have

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.250
civil civic engagement?

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.410
And how can we use these tools
and technology to create that

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.200
platform of engagement
differently?

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.670
And that's what I begin to
explore in this book as I

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.030
physically and virtually
traveled across this country

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.730
in cities and towns large and
small and looked at what

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.670
particularly mayors were doing,
city administrators,

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:02.850
and local government
was doing.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.520
Because I've come to conclude
this, my bias being

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.600
self-evident coming from local
government, now of course in

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.400
state government.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.360
But my by still remains local.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.780
If you don't like the way the
world looks when you're

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.590
standing up, stand on your
head and go local.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.990
You'll see remarkable things
happening at the local level.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.980
One thing I think you all will
agree is proximity confers

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.940
some legitimacy.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.130
And we tend to view local
government as a little bit

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.410
more responsive.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.480
We may be driven to frustration
by our local

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.440
elected officials, but they
tend to be a little more

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.920
responsive than state and
certainly federal officials.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.610
And a little less ideological.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.290
I said this long as mayor and
as a candidate for mayor.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.400
Mayors make lousy ideologues
and ideologues

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.480
make terrible mayors.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.160
But boy, you go to the federal
level, there's a Republican

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.810
plan for Social Security reform
and a Democratic plan

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.020
for Social Security reform.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.390
State level, there's an economic
development plan

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.320
coming from the Democratic
Party and an economic

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.050
development plan coming from
the Republican Party.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.480
If I, as mayor, came out with a
Democratic plan for graffiti

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.590
removal, people would roll their
eyes and say, what the

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.150
heck's this guy talking about?

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.340
Just clean up the damn
graffiti, mayor.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:09.890
Get it done.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.860
So there is more of an
orientation of results and

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.650
less tribalism.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.850
And so local government tends,
from my perspective, to be the

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.750
most effective of all forms of
governance as it relates to

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.350
solutions and an
entrepreneurial

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.630
framework of thinking.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.440
And therein lies some
of the answers

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.400
to Matthew's questions.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.000
And in the book, we lay out
some very specific and

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.900
promising examples of where
this kind of Socratic

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.620
engagement is happening where
those extreme voices are

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.720
becoming less and
less relevant.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.320
MATTHEW: One of the things you
have is about the role of data

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.060
in all this, and how that's one
of the key-- you use the

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.820
word "absolute transparency,"
which is a pretty big

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.360
statement, absolute anything
in politics.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.050
And you did caveat that a little
bit by saying, because

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.450
there's obviously
privacy issues.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.110
There's issues of security.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:57.650
And you also talk about
WikiLeaks a little bit as

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:58.330
being an example.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.550
There are some outside
limitations, implications to

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.020
absolute transparency.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.160
We were just talking about
that briefly before.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.200
So how do we do this properly?

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.950
How do we say everything
should be transparent?

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.360
All data should be out there?

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.680
Because you know, as you
mentioned over and over, it's

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.910
true, that the bureaucrats will
always withhold data.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.370
There's no reason to
get that out there.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.280
You only get skewered
by the press.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.510
You lay yourself out to be
attacked and we don't have an

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.630
environment that is
very promising or

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:24.410
conducive to that.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.340
GAVIN NEWSOM: Well,
our default--

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.730
and this is a great struggle.

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:28.890
And I don't have the perfect
answer because I don't think

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.780
it exists on the issue of
privacy and transparency.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.590
But one thing I do have is a
little bit experience and that

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.919
is the default for elected
officials and government

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.510
officials is secrecy, period.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.799
Just look at the debate we're
having, literally raging

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:44.650
today, in the wee hours last
night in a filibuster over

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.930
John Brennan's confirmation and
Paul arguing around the

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.040
drone policy.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.400
And the quote unquote, "memos" a
lack of transparency are the

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.630
same relating to the ready,
fire, aim kill list policy and

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.340
the due process concerns
around drone strikes of

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.150
American citizens that are
legitimate concerns.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.220
Even the most quote unquote,
"self-declared or

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:08.460
self-described" transparent
president, the most

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.410
transparent in our history,
President Obama, is still

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:15.010
struggling with this idea of
transparency as it relates to

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:16.930
legal justification of
these drone strikes.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:20.060
So this is easy to orient
around your rhetoric.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.740
It's difficult to practice
in reality.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.770
My experience has,
interestingly, come right back

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.290
here to Google.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.010
And in the book, I talk about
some of the early work we were

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:32.430
doing on Wi-Fi together that
didn't necessarily work out,

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.350
free Wi-Fi in San Francisco.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:37.520
And some of the correspondence
I had with your two founders,

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.520
Larry and Sergey, and the emails
that the press got

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.390
their hands on through the
Freedom of Information Act.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:48.360
And they put, literally,
infamously, two-page bleeding

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.920
story, front page, screaming
headline in the "San Francisco

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.860
Chronicle" with actual photos
of the copies of the email

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.350
about absolutely nothing.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.270
But you look at it and you go,
my gosh, some big scandal

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.870
between Google and the city.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.610
And there literally was nothing,
but it was a fury of

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:07.510
wanting to get that information
and access that

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:08.390
created this desire.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:12.140
And my response was, well, I'm
getting rid of my email.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.420
And I literally no longer
emailed anyone after that

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.110
because it was a
got you frame.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.800
The press wanted to do
it to play gotcha.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.910
And that's the frame that makes
us less willing to give

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.800
information up except
the basic minimum.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.040
I'm not saying that's the right
thing, and I encourage

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.900
the press to continue
to do that.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.290
But my argument in this
book is we're living

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.500
in a world of WikiLeaks.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.570
We're living in a glass
neighborhood.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.180
You understand this better than
anybody as it relates to

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.560
the issues of privacy.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.580
And we're going to have to, if
we're going to build trust

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.500
with the public, have to have
a default of openness.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:53.010
And data is profound from my
perspective in this context.

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.430
It's not just about a mayor's
schedule or an elected

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.200
official's contacts.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.070
And that's trivial.

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:02.080
That's the "US Weekly" version
of transparency.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.050
That's just pure interest.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.980
It's the substance that's
happening in government

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.690
agencies, locally at your
recreation and parks

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:12.290
department, the library system,
state-wide at the DMV,

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:16.150
or big planning commissions,
what's happening federally in

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.720
large agencies at Health
and Human Services.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.310
And for us to bring that data
to the light of day in a

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.780
machine-readable downloadable
way,

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.080
remarkable things can happen.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.890
And that's what is taking shape
across this country as

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.440
this open data movement's
beginning to form.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.270
And I was, as mayor,
one of the first--

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.290
I think I was the first
mayor in the country--

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:40.260
to establish an open data
requirement for data sets.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.720
And within literally hours of
putting these up, we had apps

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.610
that were created by third-party
developers that we

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:50.280
could have never imagined as
government officials the

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.050
importance of putting together
that cost us nothing.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.470
Crime data we put out
and all of a sudden

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:56.790
these crime maps occurred.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.480
Transit data and all these
remarkable transit apps.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:03.190
And we literally created an app
store for not the Android

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.240
platform, but in this case for
our own city services.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.990
And we started working with
other mayors across the

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.790
country through open APIs
and others to begin

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.180
to do the same thing.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.040
And it started making
me think, wow, what

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.620
else can we put up?

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.870
And what else can the private
sector mash up and see things

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.770
that we never could see?

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.330
And of course, afford things we
never could afford through

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.915
the traditional multi-year
procurement process.

00:12:26.915 --> 00:12:28.960
MATTHEW: You bring a lot of
good examples of people,

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.580
actually individuals, taking
this data and putting it to

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.480
good use, like crime statistics
or homeless

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.570
statistics, t hat
sort of thing.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:38.450
Why is there not more of
a for-profit ecosystem?

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:39.670
You mentioned the [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:43.240
idea about creating an incubator
for businesses that

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.240
take data from the public
sources and make

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.370
businesses around it.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:47.580
Because it seems like there's
lots of people doing

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.080
experiments.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.810
There lots of not-for-profit
work.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.490
But to do things at scale and
sustain itself, it seems like

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.030
there needs to be more
for-profit models around it.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.230
GAVIN NEWSOM: And I think you're
starting to see that.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.800
I mean, you're starting to see,
particularly in the crime

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.520
mapping technology, folks are
starting to scale that and

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.340
basically sell out that
technology, the more premium,

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.260
the freemium models in other
cities across the country.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.200
So I think you're
just starting to

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.160
see this take shape.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.490
But it's the quality
of the data.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:12.510
I mean, we're still scraping
that data.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:14.270
We're not providing
all that raw data.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:15.690
We're still curating it.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.960
And my argument is we need to
do what, interestingly,

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.780
President Reagan did in the
'80s with satellite

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:25.115
technology, of which this
company in particular has been

00:13:25.115 --> 00:13:29.150
the lion share beneficiary of
monetizing that data, which

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.370
used to just be ours.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.320
It used to be meaning
yours as taxpayers.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.660
But it was held in federal
agencies like NOAA.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:40.530
And that data was just held
there in the vaults, until in

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:44.290
the '80s they decided to open
up that platform and gave us

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:48.340
AccuWeather, gave us Google
Maps, gave us GPS, and all of

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.110
these wonderful things.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.940
And millions of jobs have been
created, billions of wealth

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:55.140
have been created because of
that open data effort.

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.160
What else is sitting in the
vaults of government that you

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.290
can mash up, monetize,
and re-imagine?

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:04.320
And it's limitless the things
that have been stored for

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.590
decades, for a century in
governments large and small

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.240
all across, not only California

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.380
but across this country.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.860
And so that's what
I'm arguing for.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.890
It's difficult though, because
we hold off the issues of

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:19.280
privacy as it relates
being unwilling to

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.490
provide certain data.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.660
Again, the default.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.220
And that's our struggle,
is what's appropriate?

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.100
It's not personnel
files, per se.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.680
But it's certainly everyone's
salary.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.140
You have a right to know that.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.190
We're struggling with that.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.195
People don't want to necessarily
know that you know

00:14:33.195 --> 00:14:36.340
their salary behind the
counter at the DMV.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:39.140
But they're public servants
and it seems you

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.370
have a right to know.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:42.520
But do you have a right to
know their disciplinary

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.010
records or their performance
reviews?

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.280
And therein lies
that friction.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.820
And so that's what we're
all struggling with.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.810
MATTHEW: Sure.

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:51.510
I think, actually from a Google
perspective, we're

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:53.490
trying to-- obviously, the data
being made available to

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.450
everybody in the world so we can
help make it available to

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.200
people, make it useful to
people would be great.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.580
Is there a way of doing this
or going down this path

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.670
without sounding like
an ideological idea?

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.180
I know you're saying you're not
an ideologue about this.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.160
But to some degree, you're
saying government should get

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.270
out the business of doing
some of this.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:09.520
And basically, get the data
out there and let

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.640
other people do it.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.470
And to some degree, we're saying
that means probably the

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:15.820
government's doing less, or can
do other things-- be free

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:16.920
to do other things.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.300
And do we get ourselves caught
in that kind of debate

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.650
inadvertently?

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.610
It's an issue for us as well
as a company of course.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:26.030
GAVIN NEWSOM: Brilliant
question.

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.370
It's interesting.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:27.830
A couple years ago I
was re-reading--

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:29.820
in anticipation of the
president's last state of the

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.420
union, it's always fun to read
previous states of the union.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.210
Also, it's a great way to
measure success in terms of

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.360
promises made and
promises kept.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.840
And a few years ago, the
president had a wonderful--

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.600
every year we have
in politics--

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.170
politicians are good at this--
we have our themes.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.060
And his was "win the future."

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.490
And I remember, this was
three years ago.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:48.710
He said, you can't win
the future with a

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:49.595
government of the past.

00:15:49.595 --> 00:15:51.370
And I'm applauding at least.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:53.610
And he said, we have 15 agencies
that are responsible

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:57.740
for exports, 5 responsible
for housing policy.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.630
And my favorite, he
says, is salmon.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.780
We have the Department of
Interior that's responsible

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.490
for salmon as it relates
to freshwater.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:07.690
But right when they make their
way out to see, it's the

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:09.900
Department of Commerce
that's responsible

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:10.830
for those same salmon.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:14.720
We cannot win the future with
a government of the past.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.930
And he was making an argument to
modernize government and to

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:21.180
become more responsive
and effective.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.330
But he then went on to say
something that I thought

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.820
rather remarkable for
a Democrat to say.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.350
He quoted Lincoln, this was
before we all started quoting

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:29.600
Lincoln after the movie.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.660
And he said, and I subscribe to
President Lincoln's point

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:39.410
of view that government should
do nothing more than what

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:43.150
individuals can do better
for themselves.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:45.600
And for a Democrat to say
that, didn't get any

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.290
attention, I thought
rather profound.

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:52.150
That's something you would
expect a conservative to say.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:57.030
And I believe his sincerity
about that in terms of

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:58.060
approaching things like that.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.650
I think now more than ever in
the era of austerity where

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:04.150
we're dealing with, I think, the
three greatest challenges

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.380
that will dominate the next 10
years-- the merger of IT and

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.920
globalization, the issues of
debt and entitlement, and

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.700
energy and climate change and
the impact that will have--

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.990
that this is a debate
worth having.

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:18.280
And my framework is the old
Donald Kettl framework, a

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.410
political scientist who
made this argument and

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:21.410
observation years ago.

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:24.463
Tim O'Reilly popularized it.

00:17:24.463 --> 00:17:26.819
And he's right, the government
today operates more like a

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:30.530
vending machine where you put
in your dollar taxes and you

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:33.720
get limited or finite choices--
police, fire, health

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.490
care, education, national
offense.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:36.830
And if you don't like
what you get--

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:37.760
you've all done it--

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.770
what do we do?

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:40.440
We shake the machine.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.350
We kick the machine.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.050
We protest--

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:45.120
Occupy Movement, Tea Party,
whatever it may be.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.010
And not thinking from that
framework of scarcity any

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:50.620
longer, this machine thinking.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:54.910
Again, the you vote,
I decide model.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:58.060
To a framework of the
platform, the

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:00.000
smartphone, the Android.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.610
The idea that you didn't develop
700,000 plus apps for

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:05.140
the Android platform.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.310
You've partnered with
millions of people.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:09.550
And as a consequence, they've
come up with creative

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:11.680
solutions and ideas that
Google could never--

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.740
you guys could never
have imagined.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.970
Why not operate government
accordingly as a platform, a

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:18.690
convener, a coordinator?

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:20.710
A cultivator, sure.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:24.540
To be, as my friend Eric
[INAUDIBLE] says, "big on what

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.780
but small on how." Less
prescriptive on how we

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.100
actually program solutions, but
committed nonetheless to

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.900
dealing with big issues
like ignorance

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.730
and poverty and disease.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.100
And use these tools of
technology that you are

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:43.770
creating in real time to
democratize, amplify, voices.

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:45.240
Because one thing I've learned--
it's the old Bill

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.695
Joy's law in Sun Microsystems.

00:18:46.695 --> 00:18:49.400
He says, no matter who you are,
no matter how good you

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.460
think you are as an
organization, the smartest

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:55.000
people work for someone else.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.400
This idea that none of us are
experts in everything, but all

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.670
of us are an expert
in something.

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:03.940
How can we connect to that
remarkable capacity

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.570
intelligence that exists in
every single one of you and

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:07.420
network that?

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.250
That notion of the wisdom
of the crowd.

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.050
How can we, as government,
begin to connect that?

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:14.770
Seven years ago, I couldn't have
imagined we'd be living

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:18.100
in the world we are today with
these tools of technology that

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.170
allow that possibility
in a profound way.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.210
Government as a platform.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:28.290
Not small, not big, not
ideological on the frame that

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:29.450
we've engaged.

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:30.010
But strong?

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:30.750
Sure.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:31.120
Lean?

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:31.700
Absolutely.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:32.240
Limited?

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.290
Fine.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:38.300
But strong and impactful in
terms of solving big problems.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.600
MATTHEW: By the way, we have
microphones here in the

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.470
audience if you want to
line up for questions.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:43.770
But I will take some from
the audience as well.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:45.570
Let me actually challenge
you on one thing.

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:46.840
One of the themes in your
book I thought was

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.880
harder to kind of accept.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.930
GAVIN NEWSOM: I'll take some
tea as I think about what

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:52.590
you're going to say.

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:54.580
MATTHEW: So the idea that you
want to bring innovation into

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:54.850
government.

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:57.400
I think it's a great idea of
freeing up data and letting

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.540
the outside world kind of play
with it and work with it.

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.020
But I think bring innovation
into government seems like a

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:04.810
much harder task.

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:07.460
How to I make government
itself more innovative?

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.570
What's the challenge?

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:10.800
There's no alternative, they
have a monopoly on power.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.980
And they are the vending
machine.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.230
They control the box.

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:15.530
How do we do this?

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.190
And secondly, you bring up this
idea about needing to

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.960
start from scratch.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.330
We can't just incrementally
improve a vending machine,

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:21.440
make a better mechanism.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.120
We need to be much more
fundamental, like moving to

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.040
the cloud and that
sort of thing.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.400
Both those things to me feel
like for the government a very

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.300
unlikely thing to happen.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.185
GAVIN NEWSOM: I get it.

00:20:30.185 --> 00:20:32.080
And trust me, I get it.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.390
And just very quick for what
it's worth, background.

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:38.950
I come from the private sector,
but in a very sort of

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:41.350
physical brick and
mortar world.

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:42.000
Small businesses.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.110
I have about 17 small business,
restaurants, hotels,

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:46.210
and wineries, about 1,000
employees in the state.

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:48.350
And I truly say that not to
impress you, but to press upon

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:51.190
you I've always tried to take
that entrepreneurial energy

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:54.060
into my work as a county
supervisor, as a mayor, and

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.270
now lieutenant governor.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:58.020
And it's extraordinarily
frustrating.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.440
I don't want to be more
business-like.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.420
We're not a business.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.610
But I want to be more iterative
and entrepreneurial.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.720
And I think we should encourage
some enlightened

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.760
risk-taking in government.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.780
We are risk adverse.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.740
We're scared to death at
tomorrow's headlines.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:12.510
And so you're absolutely
right.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:13.480
It's the right question.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.330
It's the standard operating
procedure.

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:16.780
It's a clay layer
of bureaucracy.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.600
It's a big civil service.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.610
It's a large bureaucratic,
hierarchical, top-down

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.870
organization in a world where
those organizations are being

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:28.680
leveled by folks like
yourselves.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.260
I mean, I tried to get this
out on Colbert and failed

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.450
miserably, but big
is getting small.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:34.380
MATTHEW: You are a
good-looking guy.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.725
GAVIN NEWSOM: Oh, well,
that's sweet of you.

00:21:35.725 --> 00:21:37.900
Thank you.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.840
But you think about--

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:44.030
I have a chapter "The Armies
of Davids," the slingshot's

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:44.790
not the old slingshot.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.690
It's technology now.

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:49.400
It's tearing down large
institutions.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.970
Let's go back to the
newspaper industry.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:53.800
And the issues happen
in the media,

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.060
generally publishing industry.

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:58.530
What's happened in the
music industry.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:03.480
It wasn't just Sean Parker and
the radicals and the Metallica

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.680
folks upset about that.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.530
All of a sudden Jobs made
a deal and everyone

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:08.520
went, whoa, hold on.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.720
And now, all of a sudden, we're
getting customized song

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.030
selections.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.500
We're not buying albums.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.040
You're certainly seeing that--
my old uncle is a stockbroker

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.430
talking about the good old days
when everyone had to go

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.970
through him with those big
commissions and fees.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:22.740
And so the contours
of this change--

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.400
and Don Tapscott talks a lot
about this, his argument being

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.760
the industrial economy is
running out of gas.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.780
And these large hierarchical
institutions are being

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.340
flattened by technology.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.770
Well, I make the same argument
in government.

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.560
Whether, dare I say this phrase,
we like it or not.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.830
Got me in trouble
on gay marriage.

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:41.640
We've got to own up to that
because we're in a collision

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.840
course with the future.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.480
We are still iterating
on yesterday's

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.520
technology and platforms.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.850
By the way, I made
the case of '73.

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:49.570
Let me be literal.

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:52.370
California, front page of the
"LA Times" to their credit,

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:56.130
did a big report a few weeks ago
about a technology system

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.282
upgrade at DMV.

00:22:58.282 --> 00:22:59.430
$208 million.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:01.760
They already spent more than
half the money and weren't

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.140
even a quarter of
the way done.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:07.340
Just fired HP, I'll say it.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:11.100
And the director at DMV said we
then are still holding on

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.260
and holding hope of hopes--
holding hands--

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:19.070
to keep together a 40-year-old
technology system.

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:24.440
We have a case management system
that is so remarkable

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:28.180
at our court system that in
2004, the Chief Justice to his

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.470
credit said, I'm going to
upgrade the system.

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.530
Identified $260 million
of your money

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:33.360
to upgrade the system.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.340
It was going to be
done in 2008.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:39.860
Connect the dots, 58 county
systems to allow access,

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.460
aggregate this data.
$260 million.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:43.860
It's going to be done in 2008.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.610
2009, 2010, someone
says, hey, what's

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:47.340
going on with the system?

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:48.900
Did an audit.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.270
One contractor alone had 100--

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:51.840
I kid you not.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.730
I'm not making this up.

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:55.050
Had 103 change orders.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:58.440
Had already spent $100 million
on their $33 million

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.170
subcontract.

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:02.810
They had already spent half a
billion dollars and the report

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:06.990
came out and said, we can still
complete this project.

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:08.600
Not for the $260 million.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.320
Obviously, not by 2008.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:15.260
But we think we can get it done
by 2015 for-- get this--

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:19.740
$1.9 billion.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:20.890
You can't make that up.

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:23.910
Now, I bet only one or two of
you have ever heard of that.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:27.550
But I bet more than half of you
heard about the scandal in

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:31.360
the California recreation and
parks system about the money

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.300
we had when we were closing
down those parks.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:35.950
And what was that scandal?

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:39.670
We didn't "spend" the
money we had.

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:42.300
And I just gave you an example,
hundreds of millions

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:42.990
of dollars of waste.

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:44.700
Our payroll system,
$371 million.

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.680
Contractor fired three
weeks ago.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:51.130
Upgraded CalPERS system, 49 data
centers consolidated into

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:52.470
one called myCalPERS.

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:56.440
Everyone is wishing to get the
old your CalPERS back.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.180
That was only $226 million
over budget.

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.210
You can't make this thing up.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:03.760
We're still buying
and building.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.480
We're still building, not
even buying IT systems.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:11.260
And we're patching together
technology that was again, on

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.780
the cutting edge 40 years ago.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.480
Meanwhile, everyone's
going to the cloud.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.620
We have all these on-demand
resources.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.760
We're going through multi-year
procurements for half a

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:25.990
million dollar websites where
your niece and nephews who are

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:29.580
12 and 13 over the weekends
are doing them for free.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.300
So it's not just the technology

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.080
that I'm arguing for.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.020
It's a mindset.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.240
And part of that is sort of--
and I argue in the book-- the

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.960
Eric Ries lean startup
construct.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.480
And you're seeing
some of that.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:44.480
Todd park, HSS, and others have
been able to successfully

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.380
incorporate this.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:48.080
So it's a long way of answering
your question.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.910
I'm seeing the contours
of this change.

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:52.550
And I'm a little more optimistic
because we don't

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:53.790
have a choice.

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:57.220
We are, literally, running
out the clock on this

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:58.570
old model of delivery.

00:25:58.570 --> 00:25:59.460
MATTHEW: I mean, to some
degree this is a

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.640
generational thing.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.410
It's definitely a different
mindset.

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:05.080
These are the digital natives
versus the people

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:05.970
who come to it later.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:07.350
GAVIN NEWSOM: The immigrants,
like me,

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:08.330
learning the language.

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:09.260
MATTHEW: Myself included.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:10.670
Here we are.

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:11.950
But no, I think it's
interesting.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:15.510
But also I think scarcity
creates creativity.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:18.380
And to some degree, the good
side of all this austerity

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.210
that the governments around
the world are dealing with

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.200
right now is they have
to get creative.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.280
And expectations are growing
very quickly.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.800
Are all these lines going
to line up properly?

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.840
Like, we have all the
expectations going very fast.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.060
We have problems going
very fast.

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.440
Everything is going
exponential.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.590
From your perspective, do you
think the solutions will

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:40.910
outstrip the needs, or are we
going to have potential issues

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:42.640
of political unrest,
or whatever.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.340
How bad can it get from
your perspective?

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:44.740
GAVIN NEWSOM: Thank you.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.530
I mean, this is why
I wrote the book.

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:50.090
Because there's been a trend
line here, but not necessarily

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:51.340
a [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:52.510
And when I say collision
course of the

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:55.142
future, I mean it.

00:26:55.142 --> 00:26:56.410
You think about just--

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:59.050
I was with Tom Friedman-- and I
reference this in the book--

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:02.360
who wrote "The World is Flat"
in 2005, bestseller.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.170
It talks about his connected
world, issues of globalization

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:05.855
and technology.

00:27:05.855 --> 00:27:08.030
It's really a technology book.

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:09.880
And Tom was here
at Santa Clara.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.520
We did an economic development
summit.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.120
And he summed it up
quite brilliantly.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.070
And forgive the examples.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:19.240
You guys are confident in your
own success of the fact that I

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:23.610
won't mention you should not
diminish your status in

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:26.770
relationship to this because you
were ahead of the curve.

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:28.760
But he made the point in his
book "The World is Flat" in

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.470
2005, Facebook wasn't
even in it.

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:33.470
This is a book about technology
and globalization.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:35.560
In 2005, not that long ago.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.720
He said Twitter was a sound.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.630
The cloud was in the sky.

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.060
4G was a parking space.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.290
LinkedIn was a prison.

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:46.740
Apps were things we filled
out to get into Stanford

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:47.910
University.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:51.160
And Skype, for most
of us, was a typo.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.570
And his point is we're no longer
in a connected world,

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:55.390
but a hyper-connected world.

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:58.300
Those things are ubiquitous, by
definition, in our lives.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.790
As you are in our lives.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:02.070
And they didn't exist as
we know them seven

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:03.530
or eight years ago.

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:06.110
This trend line is
extraordinary.

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:10.990
And as a complement to your
point, this is a generation,

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:14.900
this net generation, this
digital natives, of choice.

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:18.470
Where everything's being
customized around you.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:23.190
And we still have mass systems
of education, fast food models

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:26.290
of education, standardized
everything.

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:28.420
We're still professors
to teach--

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.810
teacher's professing and giving
you, broadcasting what

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:33.470
you're supposed to
be learning.

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:36.790
We still, my gosh, you sit in
rows of desks based on your

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:39.480
date of manufacture.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.780
Same age cohort, same single
subjects ringing bells that

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:47.800
Ben Franklin would have heard
hundreds of years ago.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.530
And you extend that out.

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:51.280
That's the way we're
educating people.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.520
Extend that out to all
government services.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.550
I mean, you literally
go into the DMV.

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:59.060
I got a text message, I kid
you not, about a renewal.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.070
You can't make this up where
it said a change of address

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.780
because I had just moved.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:03.720
It says, please--

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.280
I mean, literally a week
ago, it said type--

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.120
the word "type." You've
got to be kidding.

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:13.490
You can type or write in with
ink your change of address on

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:15.690
your card and keep
it with you.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:17.550
Talk about just completely
antiquated

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:19.580
thinking in every respect.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:24.220
So I am very fearful because
when we ask you to vote every

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.890
two or four years and you've
got to figure out where the

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:30.000
heck to do that down at
some fire station.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.420
It used to be post office,
but we know what's

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.920
happening to them.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.370
And then you connect the dot
with this felt-tip pen that

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:38.310
may or may not work because it
was sitting out and no one put

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:39.220
the cap back on.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:42.090
And then all of a sudden, they
give you a nice sticker.

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:45.290
Meanwhile, you're Googling on
your latest iteration of the

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:49.690
Android platform and you're in
the real world and you're

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:49.990
disconnected.

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:52.690
Meanwhile, you're voting like
and dislike on YouTube 15

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.320
times as you were waiting
in line to vote

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.080
for the next president.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.150
It's completely antithetical
the world we're living in.

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:02.340
So when I talk about collision
course, I mean it.

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:06.190
And we better wake up because
this is, I think, code red for

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:07.720
government.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:12.680
LA just had their big mayor's
race two days ago.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.840
And it wasn't just
the mayor's race.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.750
It was their city attorney.

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:19.210
It was tons of ballot
initiatives.

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:20.790
And this is the second
largest city in the

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:22.260
United States of America.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:24.090
Largest city in California.

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:25.980
Profoundly significant
to the GDP of this

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.410
state and our nation.

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:30.360
Major race for mayor.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.140
And a remarkable
thing happened.

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:34.950
They said it was almost record
numbers of people showed up.

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:37.010
Everyone was so pleased.

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:40.620
It broke 15% of registered
voters.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:44.440
We're talking single
digit folks.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.770
And it's not an indictment of
the previous mayor, but he was

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:52.502
reelected with 158,000 votes in
a city of 4 million people.

00:30:52.502 --> 00:30:54.400
And it's nothing
to do with him.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.040
People are just disengaged.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.810
Outside of presidential
campaigns, we just don't care.

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:01.720
And you're solving problems
peer to peer

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.630
now more than ever.

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:04.220
You've heard of donor's
choose and you're

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:04.730
saying, you know what?

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:06.020
I'm going to go right
in the classroom

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:06.780
and solve my problems.

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.990
I'm not waiting around for guys
like this Newsom guy how

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:11.110
to solve my problems.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.890
I'll go to Kiva.

00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:14.230
I'm going to solve problems
in Kenya and hey,

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:15.080
Kiva's now in our back--

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.005
I'm going to solve problems in
the Mission District in San

00:31:17.005 --> 00:31:18.270
Francisco with kiva.org.

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:20.340
Or, I'm going to go on Indiegogo
or Kickstarter,

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:23.100
whatever it is, to
solve problems.

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.730
And so how do we take that
populism that's in the air and

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:26.840
reconnect it with government?

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.070
Because I believe
in government.

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:31.420
I want to make a case
for government.

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:34.820
And I want to reconnect your
purpose and passion and make

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:35.910
it fun again.

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:38.130
That's the rift Citizenville.

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:41.130
Games, gamification, and what's
happening in the world.

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:42.970
I remember "Schoolhouse Rock!"
Some of you are old enough to

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:44.460
remember "Schoolhouse
Rock!," right?

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:44.890
MATTHEW: Definitely.

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:45.675
GAVIN NEWSOM: Age of
you and I, buddy.

00:31:45.675 --> 00:31:46.480
MATTHEW: Conjunction Junction.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.380
GAVIN NEWSOM: A couple.

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:49.850
But remember we all remember
it because it was fun and

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:50.105
educational.

00:31:50.105 --> 00:31:51.480
The only thing--

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.480
how a bill becomes a law on
Capitol Hill you may recall.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.665
The only thing they didn't
mention was lobbyists, how it

00:31:57.665 --> 00:31:58.860
really works.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.310
Money.

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:02.340
But it was entertaining
and educational.

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:04.990
I mean, you're seeing the
examples of this in the "New

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:08.720
York Times" columnist Kristof
who just did with "Half the

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.480
Sky" talking about the
issues of women.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.530
They just came up with social
games for good.

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:14.710
And they have a game to
encourage people and to

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:16.680
educate people about the issue
of women and girls around the

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.190
world in empowerment.

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:21.680
And so how do we meet people
where they are?

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:22.740
MATTHEW: Again, let me encourage
people to take the

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.720
microphone if they
have questions.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.140
I know you didn't talk about
this much in your book, but I

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:28.555
did want to ask you, how does
this play out internationally?

00:32:28.555 --> 00:32:30.090
You talked mostly, it
seemed like, about

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:31.436
domestic politics here.

00:32:31.436 --> 00:32:33.490
But what's your view on that?

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:34.660
GAVIN NEWSOM: It plays
perfectly.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:35.130
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:36.650
in Spain, [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:38.880
I mean when the microbloggers
in China, quarter

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.090
of a billion folks.

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:43.820
Chinese government cannot
suppress those voices, even

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:48.020
though they spend more money
in China to suppress voices

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.240
than they do on national
defense.

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.690
What's happened obviously,
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:52.240
Square.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.770
It's happened around the
rest of the world.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:55.980
It's very real and
very relevant.

00:32:55.980 --> 00:33:00.480
And of course, your own Eric
Schmidt coming out with a book

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.710
to raise that consciousness and
elevate the international

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:06.695
debate along these same
lines with his book.

00:33:06.695 --> 00:33:09.030
MATTHEW: Let's take some
questions from the audience.

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:11.000
MALE SPEAKER: So I just came
back from living a few years

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.200
in a rather large city, which I
won't mention to prejudices,

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.570
and the trains and subways
are clean.

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:18.370
They run on time.

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:19.270
They're not expensive.

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:21.030
There's no garbage
on the streets.

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:23.340
The potholes are filled,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:25.670
And I come back to San Francisco
and I'm trying to

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:25.930
understand--

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:29.410
GAVIN NEWSOM: It's changed
since I'm mayor, I know.

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:31.280
Yes.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.700
MALE SPEAKER: And the
taxes aren't that

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.090
much higher, either.

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:36.240
I'm trying to understand how
what you're talking about is

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.810
going to solve those really
basic questions.

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:41.630
Let's forget about the fancier
ones you're talking about.

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:44.550
GAVIN NEWSOM: Well, I
mean, substantively.

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:46.910
I could give you dozens of
examples as it relates to

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:48.820
issues of homelessness,
potholes.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.170
I mean, just one example
see, click, fix.

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:55.630
See a pothole, click it, send
it with the open API we did

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:57.550
with Twitter to 311
call center in San

00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:58.960
Francisco, fix it.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:03.230
Two-way conversation, measured,
mapped, and people

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:04.240
are empowered.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.830
Citizens are more engaged.

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:08.750
And we are held to a higher
level of accountability.

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:13.320
I can give you dozens of
examples of improved

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:17.909
efficiency, reduced costs, more
citizen engagement with

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:20.000
these kinds of tools of
technology that begin to

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.050
address the timeliness of buses,
the ability to address

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:29.360
panhandling, the competency of
our efforts to pave and clean

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.909
streets along the lines
of your question.

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:33.120
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, but that
other one I'm talking about

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.250
was put in place by a big
bureaucracy and so

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:36.940
forth and it worked.

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:39.120
And I'm saying there's probably
something a whole lot

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.889
more-- and by the way there,
if a train's more than five

00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:44.500
minutes late, they give you a
paper so you can give that at

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.270
the office because that's
how seldom it happens.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.810
GAVIN NEWSOM: I guess I have
a bias for our form of

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:55.710
governance as imperfect
as it is.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:35:00.850
I'm with Justice Brandeis that
in a democracy, the most

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:03.030
important office is the
office of citizen.

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:05.880
And what I'm arguing for here is
active citizen engagement,

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:08.610
which with respect to some of
those examples, though I don't

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:11.560
know yours particularly, I doubt
there's that kind of

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.770
active citizen engagement.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:17.230
There's probably more of a
top-down centralized model of

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.870
governance that I don't
necessarily think in the long

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:22.780
run is going to service
more than just

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.010
getting trains on time.

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:26.260
It doesn't service the
entrepreneurial passions and

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:29.270
the innovative spirit that I
think defines the best of our

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.990
region and our state.

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:31.650
MALE SPEAKER: It was
a democracy.

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:31.990
GAVIN NEWSOM: Yeah.

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:34.200
Well, let me also
just concur--

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:39.910
hell, I was just at the Incheon
Airport in Korea,

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:42.370
which is one of those airports
you just hope along the lines

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:46.520
you're arguing that you have
your plane delayed because

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:51.350
it's got a couple golf courses,
hotel, spa, a museum.

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:56.840
And I flew from there to LAX,
which literally-- you got my

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.930
point-- is like flying from
the Jetsons to the

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:00.350
Flintstones.

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:05.780
So I'm not denying your
example and embracing

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:08.480
high-speed rail and the
remarkable capacity in

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.690
Singapore and other parts
of the world to

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:11.620
do wonderful things.

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:12.920
We got to get back in
the future business.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:16.610
That's certainly a big part of
what I talk about every day

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:18.860
and try to connect some
dots in the book.

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:21.330
And I do think there's
ways that we can

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:23.520
substantially compete.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.430
And I'm not giving
up on our form of

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:27.460
governance yet, though.

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:29.570
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks for coming
to see us, Gavin.

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:32.560
I think apathy is certainly
one of the huge issues our

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.940
government's facing right now.

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:35.930
But recently, the last couple
years since the Citizens

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:38.950
United case, the super PAC
money, or as Colbert would

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:41.680
call it, spooky PAC money,
seems to have--

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.760
GAVIN NEWSOM: I contributed to
his Super PAC, by the way.

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:44.150
MALE SPEAKER: Did you?

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.450
Good job.

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:44.720
So did I.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:44.980
GAVIN NEWSOM: I did.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.520
That's why I went on
his show, I think.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:47.470
I paid for that.

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:49.810
MALE SPEAKER: You
paid for that.

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:53.052
GAVIN NEWSOM: And did I
pay after I went on.

00:36:53.052 --> 00:36:54.770
I did "Meet the Press"
two days later.

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:55.650
I was so relaxed.

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:57.110
I'm like, oh, this is great.

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:58.030
MALE SPEAKER: It was easy.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.820
GAVIN NEWSOM: Colbert, jeez.

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.070
MALE SPEAKER: Everything's
easy [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:00.920
GAVIN NEWSOM: I'll warn
Eric before he

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.030
goes on his book tour.

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.760
I'm just saying.

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.330
Eric, if you're listening,
beware.

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:08.840
MALE SPEAKER: So with that
threat still out there, do you

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:12.370
see these new platforms, these
new ways of engagement, as

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:15.670
ways to overcome what's going
on with Citizens United and

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:16.250
Super PACs?

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:19.000
Do we have to be worried about
movements being co-opted?

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.500
I think we saw a little bit with
the Tea Party movement

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.480
and things like that of
groups coming in.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.770
How do we get around this?

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:29.230
GAVIN NEWSOM: Maybe it's a bit
idealistic, but I think

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:33.660
organized voices are more
powerful than organized money.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:37.000
I think the participatory nature
of social media, the

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.150
ability to engage,
self-organizing like

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:42.890
[INAUDIBLE] communities,
ultimately will empower and

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:46.900
engender a more successful
result than those that

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:50.930
centralize and try to pick
winners and losers with a

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:52.730
Super PAC framework
of engagement.

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:57.430
It's interesting, of all people,
I got this strange--

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:59.090
by definition, for me,
it was strange.

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:01.040
It wasn't a strange email.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:06.140
But Newt Gingrich reached out
to me, called the book

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:07.490
extraordinary.

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:10.320
I responded in saying, I have
to re-read my book, Newt.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.090
I'll get back to you.

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:14.380
MATTHEW: Did he tweet
about it?

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.450
GAVIN NEWSOM: What the
hell was in this?

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:20.980
And I kid you not, I sent him
another email late last night

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:25.260
because he wrote a newsletter
reinforcing that, encouraging

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:28.520
everyone to read this book
because he picked up on

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.710
something that goes
to your question.

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:34.480
He's in a big fight-- and he
didn't say this, but I now get

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:37.850
it-- with Karl Rove because he
doesn't like what Rove's

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:38.730
trying to do.

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:41.940
And this is not about the
veracity of either argument,

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.100
it's just an interesting
debate.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.200
Because Rove is trying to make
a case that we're going to

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:50.100
pick and choose winners in these
states, so that they're

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:54.460
more electable so we can take
back the Senate in 2014.

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:57.550
And Gingrich is fiercely
fighting that because he

00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:01.410
believes that's a centralized
top-down frame where big money

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:04.120
is trying to influence
elections.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.900
And his argument is bottom-up

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.775
thinking, which is my argument.

00:39:08.775 --> 00:39:13.000
His argument is small-town
conservatism.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.050
His argument is grass roots.

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:17.610
And I find that interesting.

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:20.590
And he was able to connect the
dots here on technology in

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:25.090
looking at a 21st century form
of governing and organizing in

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:27.950
relationship to what he would
call those Jeffersonian

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:31.970
principles of individual liberty
and self-government.

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:34.430
And so it goes back to your
question earlier, which is an

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:38.110
interesting one, that there's
sort of an ideological

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:40.880
bandwidth here that's a lot
broader than what you'd expect

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.970
coming from an ex-mayor of San
Francisco and a Democratic

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:45.290
lieutenant governor from
one of the bluest

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:47.030
states in our nation.

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:48.880
MATTHEW: It goes to what you
said about change.gov as well,

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.820
which is it's very difficult
to get these

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:51.990
tools right, initially.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:55.660
I think we collectively had
some first missteps that I

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:56.360
think we'll learn from.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:57.750
But the tools have
to be smarter.

00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:01.370
And they have to weed out, I
guess, the spammers and people

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:04.040
who are misguiding it or
try and co-opt it.

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.190
And we have a lot of experience
with this as

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:07.590
company I think with communities
that we have to

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:10.250
curate and work with YouTube
and so forth.

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:13.020
I think a lot of that will have
to work in the political

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:13.730
sphere, too.

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:15.220
Otherwise, it could
be co-opted.

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:16.165
GAVIN NEWSOM: Yeah,
that's true.

00:40:16.165 --> 00:40:18.850
MALE SPEAKER: I don't know if
you are familiar in the last

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:23.800
elections in November, there
was a young 18-year-old who

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.300
ran for mayor of Fremont.

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.830
He's my son, by the way.

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:31.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:34.680
MALE SPEAKER: And he ran on the
platform of something just

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.890
along the lines of what
you're talking about.

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:39.670
He wanted to bring about
transformational change in the

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:40.560
government.

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:44.150
And how the government should
start thinking out of the box

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:48.160
and bring about innovative
solutions in how to govern.

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.510
And obviously, he didn't win.

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:54.540
But he still has a passion
and he has the energy.

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:59.490
What advice would you have for
young people like him to join

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:02.370
politics, and how do they
bring about change?

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:02.930
GAVIN NEWSOM: I love it.

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:03.683
Thank you, and congrats.

00:41:03.683 --> 00:41:05.540
And you're obviously a good role
model that you encouraged

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:08.510
him to do it at a
remarkable age.

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:10.110
Two thoughts on this.

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:12.050
First thing is you're absolutely
right, I'm arguing

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:13.860
for a different division
of labor.

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:16.210
I'm not arguing for
e-government.

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:19.540
That's happening
on the natural.

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.790
And I hate this phrase, but
I'll use it because it

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:26.070
simplifies it, I'm arguing
for we government.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:29.790
I want more voices
and more choices.

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:33.940
I want to devolve and
involve people into

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:35.920
building sense of community.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.940
I support real participatory
budgeting along the lines of

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:40.480
what Brazil's been doing.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:43.550
New York just started a
small version of this.

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:46.570
Real, active citizen engagement,
not inert

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:47.180
citizenship.

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:48.670
So that's the argument.

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:51.580
But I also make an argument
in this book--

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:56.510
and this is my advice to your
son, that this is a book about

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:57.740
leadership.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.570
And I make the case that--

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:00.430
and this is my belief.

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:01.910
Good people can disagree.

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:06.130
That we've got it wrong holding
it out for this guy or

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:08.820
gal on the white horse to come
in and save our day.

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.010
I don't buy that anymore.

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:14.150
My father years and years ago
used to make this point and it

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:17.370
came together when Tom Peters
wrote about this years ago,

00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:19.130
and he really distilled it.

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:28.920
What did Dr. King, Gandhi,
Mandela, and Havel all have in

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.570
common at the peak of
their influence?

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:34.940
Havel, King, Mandela, Gandhi,
the peak of their influence,

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:37.100
what did they have in common?

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:39.170
Jail time.

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:40.800
Interesting fact.

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.280
But they also had something
else in common.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:45.500
They exercised their
moral authority.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:46.700
None of them had formal
authority.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.910
In fact, you could argue that
when Vaclav Havel--

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:52.740
in fact, he argued himself in
a lot of his writings--

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:55.100
became president of
Czechoslovakia, he lost a lot

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:56.650
of his influence.

00:42:56.650 --> 00:43:00.730
Same with Mandela after getting
formal authority in

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:01.830
South Africa.

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:06.110
And so my advice to your son
is to consider that.

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:06.910
You don't need to be--

00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:07.760
MATTHEW: Go to prison?

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:08.515
GAVIN NEWSOM: No.

00:43:08.515 --> 00:43:10.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:12.760
MATTHEW: OK, just being clear.

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:15.650
GAVIN NEWSOM: The moral
component of that.

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:17.605
But if he must, he must.

00:43:17.605 --> 00:43:19.950
We sure as heck risked it
as you said when we

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:22.200
broke the law in 2004.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.680
I thought I'd be recalled
and arrested.

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.540
I really did.

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:27.300
Was willing to do that to put
a human face on an issue of

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.040
something I cared about because
I didn't want to wait

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:33.020
30 years, as was the case with
interracial marriage, to one

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.190
day see it happen
in my lifetime.

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:37.150
Here we are nine years later
and we may see it in a few

00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:39.510
weeks at the Supreme Court.

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:43.730
That said, to consider that you
don't need to be something

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:45.000
to do something.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.950
You don't need to be somebody
to do something.

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:49.970
Exercise your moral authority.

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:52.580
And make the determination of
whether or not being part of

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:56.690
the system is actually better
than being outside the system.

00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:58.640
Maybe it's good he
lost is my point.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.730
Final point, back
to the we always

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:02.200
are now quoting Lincoln.

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:04.790
The one quote I never hear of
Lincoln that I love says we're

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:09.740
all born originals but
we die copies.

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:12.540
And I think of that in the
context particularly of

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.950
politicians and elections.

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:16.660
We watch those campaign
commercials and you're like,

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:19.380
wow, that guy or gal,
she's great.

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:20.610
So creative.

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:21.570
So passionate.

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:22.970
So authentic.

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:27.110
And then you look back 15
years later when they're

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:30.130
termed out and you say,
man, they just--

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:31.660
what happened to that person?

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:33.100
They're like everybody else.

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:37.820
It's as if the process of
governing de-geniuses you.

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:40.700
The system de-geniuses you.

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:44.000
Originality is lost because of
the way things are done.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.500
Remember, Obama again, let's
not-- he was right and he

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:47.480
struggled with this.

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.880
We don't want to change
the players, we want

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:50.135
to change the game.

00:44:50.135 --> 00:44:52.220
And that's my argument
in this book.

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:55.910
We've got to redesign, as your
son wanted to redesign, that

00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:56.860
engagement.

00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:00.810
And redesign our thinking and
consciousness around the role

00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:04.110
of government and the role of
citizens in relationship to

00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:05.360
our governing institution.

00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:08.460
MALE SPEAKER: Hi, Gavin.

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:12.800
I'm wondering how we can
institute a gamification of

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:16.620
the political while still
keeping the rhetoric relevant.

00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:18.850
So for every White House
petition for unlocking

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:21.760
cellphones, we have one about
the Death Star and we have one

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:22.570
about R. Kelly's [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:24.110
GAVIN NEWSOM: You don't feel
the Death Star's important?

00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:25.420
MALE SPEAKER: I do, but--

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:29.680
GAVIN NEWSOM: What about
deporting Piers Morgan?

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:30.930
How about daylight
savings latest

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:34.840
petition coming this Sunday?

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:36.090
Good point.

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:40.160
Tim O'Reilly-- we had a great
conversation in this book

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:40.990
about this.

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:43.490
And he made this case, and the
reason I put it in is I agree

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:46.590
with him 100%, that this is
not about creating a new

00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:48.190
framework of petitioning
government to

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:50.150
do things for you.

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:54.340
This is about creating new
mechanisms to do things with

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:56.260
government.

00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:59.680
This is about creating a new
platform and framework of real

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.260
engagement.

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:05.300
President Obama, as you know,
took the change.gov and now

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.790
it's done something called
We the People.

00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:12.190
And after 5,000 virtual
petitions, Jay Carney at the

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:15.360
White House would respond to
any of those petitions.

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.050
And the Death Star was one of
the dominant petitions.

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:19.100
They kind of disregarded that.

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:20.440
The press disregard that.

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:22.330
But the Piers Morgan example
was infamous.

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:25.830
Because right after the NRA went
after Piers, there was a

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:29.710
big petition to deport Piers
back to the country that

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:32.890
forced us to bear arms
in the first place--

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:34.440
those Brits.

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.442
And it got 70-plus-thousand.

00:46:36.442 --> 00:46:39.260
And there's Carney in the
beginning of the debate around

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.430
drones going you've
got to be kidding.

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:44.580
Guy is on CNN and I have
to respond to this?

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:46.560
So what did the White
House decide to do?

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:49.550
They decided to raise the
threshold for petitions before

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:51.840
they respond, missing
the whole point.

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:55.060
It's not about petitioning
folks with the machine

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:57.540
thinking to do things for you.

00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:00.340
It's about that again, new
division of labor and

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:02.070
different kind of engagement.

00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:04.630
MALE SPEAKER: This is sort of
an ideological question, but

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:07.440
you touched upon this earlier.

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:12.900
Why is the public sector so
inefficient and so averse to

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.040
change compared to the
private sector?

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.490
GAVIN NEWSOM: Well, it's the
old adage, move the mouse,

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:17.310
move the cheese.

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:20.430
You want to move it, you
got to move the cheese.

00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:23.190
There's no incentive
for good behavior.

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:25.350
There's incentive for
terrible behavior.

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:27.390
Every single person's
acting in their best

00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:28.920
interest all of the time.

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:31.170
It's a remarkably efficient
thing and it's rather

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:32.360
predictable.

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.270
The sequestration is a perfect
example of that.

00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:36.750
It's in everyone's interest
to do what they've done.

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:39.320
Otherwise, they wouldn't
do it.

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.250
I mean, you think about
Congress in

00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:42.650
single digit ratings.

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:45.350
I mean literally, you remember
the debater around NFL

00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:46.510
replacement refs?

00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:49.550
There was a new poll just came
out that shows three to one

00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:54.702
people prefer the NFL
replacement refs to Congress,

00:47:54.702 --> 00:47:58.760
which I just think
sums it all up.

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:03.450
But yet, Republican Congress
in single digits won

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:05.630
reelection rather
overwhelmingly.

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:06.720
They only lost eight seats.

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.025
I mean, they may seem
significant.

00:48:08.025 --> 00:48:09.190
But at the end of the
day, they held

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:10.710
onto a strong majority.

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:13.390
Just two seats in the Senate.

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:17.160
We act in our best interest
because the system's designed

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:18.710
for inefficiency.

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:20.700
We are a monopoly.

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:25.220
The only way you get fired is
actually working outside of

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:28.110
your job description.

00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:31.130
The reason I have a failure
award in my businesses, why I

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:36.720
reward the biggest screwup, is
I can't stand the contrast

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:41.035
with my day job as lieutenant
governor in government.

00:48:41.035 --> 00:48:42.560
I have a little hotel,
just very, very

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:43.910
briefly up in Tahoe.

00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:45.346
A lot of mosquitoes
during the winter.

00:48:45.346 --> 00:48:48.550
It was built in 1959 for the
delegates of the Olympics, the

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:49.390
'60 Olympics.

00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:50.160
So it's an old hotel.

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.240
We don't have air
conditioning.

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:54.520
So we keep the doors to the
hallways open in the summer.

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:56.220
I had one of those
eccentric folks.

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:58.290
They're all eccentric,
those night clerks.

00:48:58.290 --> 00:48:59.790
The guy when you check in at
2:00 in the morning you go,

00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:00.550
who is this person?

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:02.480
Why would you have this job?

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:05.420
And this guy decided on his own
before he came to work at

00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:10.770
11 o'clock at night to buy a
bunch of catfish because he

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:12.220
thought-- it was an
interesting idea.

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:13.700
He said, I'm going to take the
catfish and put it in all the

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:17.960
ponds outside of the hotel so
they after the mosquitoes.

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:21.010
Maybe we'll reduce the problem
we have with mosquitoes.

00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:23.570
Well, he leaves about 5:00 in
the morning and Ludo, who had

00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:24.220
been with me for--

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.600
I don't know, 14, 15 years--
my engineer,

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.600
never once called me.

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:30.360
Wakes me up.

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:31.590
Goes, I can't believe this.

00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:34.380
I don't know what to say, but
you have to hear this.

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:35.200
It's the strangest thing.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.520
I think we've been vandalized.

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:38.650
But all throughout the hotel--

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:40.060
and It.

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:40.650
Could be worse.

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:41.320
This is strange.

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.340
But there's eyeballs of fish.

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:44.760
There's tails.

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:45.990
There's all these fish.

00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:47.540
I mean, it's just chaotic.

00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:48.820
Bones.

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:50.350
So I'm going call
you right back.

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:51.720
I just need to let
you know this.

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.030
I'm like, what the
hell is this?

00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:55.220
I said, figure this thing out.

00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:58.430
Calls me back a couple hours
later and figured it out.

00:49:58.430 --> 00:50:00.720
Our night clerk went out,
bought catfish,

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:01.870
put them in the ponds.

00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:02.980
And what happened?

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:10.090
The raccoons got in in total
delirium, wildly enthusiastic,

00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:14.040
running around, were running
through the hotel, and

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:17.460
throwing the carcasses all
around, et cetera.

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:22.750
And so I heard this relieved and
was inspired to create the

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:23.460
failure award.

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:26.650
I gave this guy an $800
bonus because it was

00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:28.700
such a glorious failure.

00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:32.860
And it contrasted so well to my
days in San Francisco as a

00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:36.750
supervisor at the time where
the only-- if something

00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:39.920
happened like that, that person
would have been fired.

00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:44.340
As opposed to celebrating a
glorious failure and learning

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:47.410
from it because the guy
had initiative.

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:49.270
And I'll close with this,
just to underscore.

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:50.520
I'm a big labor guy.

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:53.450
We're a $10.55 minimum
wage city.

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:55.280
We have universal preschool,
not just

00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:56.480
universal health care.

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.080
Heck, our kindergarten
students.

00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:01.190
I created sometime I'm so proud
of called K through 12

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:04.240
where we're giving little
college savings accounts to

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:07.230
every single person that enters
into kindergarten gets

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:09.295
their own online bank account.

00:51:09.295 --> 00:51:12.230
It starts small, but it
creates a mindset of

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.525
expectation.

00:51:12.525 --> 00:51:15.040
The old adage, once a mind's
stretched, it never goes back

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:15.820
to its original form.

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:18.280
We're a pretty progressive
place.

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:20.640
And labor's been sponsored,
all those things.

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:21.300
They've been fabulous.

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:24.520
But there was a big contract
that said performance reviews

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:27.390
and disciplinary records cannot
be considered with

00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:28.085
regard to promotion.

00:51:28.085 --> 00:51:29.470
I'll repeat that.

00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:32.640
The largest public employee in
San Francisco said performance

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:36.280
reviews comma disciplinary
records cannot be considered

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:37.170
with regard to promotion.

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:38.460
Imagine if Google had that?

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:43.650
Hey, that'd be great.

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:45.550
You want to go to Tahoe today?

00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:49.980
And I just thought it was
a demoralizing thing.

00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:51.990
And I fought to take that out.

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:56.530
And the point was we only
celebrated the success of

00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:59.060
someone just being around an
extra few days or months or

00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:02.220
years, but not someone's
creativity,

00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:04.080
not someone's genius.

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:06.990
And that's the kind of incentive
that's going to

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:11.870
elevate our quality and our
capacity to improve.

00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:15.800
And that created that friction,
that stress that

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.600
I've had over these years
living in both worlds.

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:20.370
And frankly, what I hope--

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:23.460
long-winded way of wrapping
things up--

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:27.430
that in this book I provide
some specific tangible

00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:31.500
examples to begin to address a
hybrid of these two principles

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:36.330
and philosophy so that, in
closing, government can become

00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:39.350
as smart as Google.

00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:40.550
Thank you, guys.

00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:41.450
MATTHEW: Thank you very much.

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:42.050
GAVIN NEWSOM: Thanks.

00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:47.150
