00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.800
- AT THIS TIME OF YEAR, I AM
ESPECIALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.966
BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE
EVERY DAY IN OUR ARMED FORCES.

00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.566
- I AM ALSO--YES.

00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:13.866
[cheers and applause]

00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:16.866
I AM ALSO EQUALLY INSPIRED BY
THE STRENGTH OF THEIR FAMILIES.

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:20.466
BEFORE WE GO, THERE'S A MILITARY
WIFE IN THE AUDIENCE

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:23.700
WHO I WOULD LIKE TO MEET.
HER NAME IS CARRIE CURTIS.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.733
WHERE ARE YOU, CARRIE CURTIS?
- [squeals]

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:35.733
[cheers and applause]

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.900
[indistinct, excited talking]

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.100
--OH GOD, I LOVE YOU!
- HAVE A SEAT!

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.200
HI CARRIE!

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.600
YOUR HUSBAND IS IN WHAT--
WHAT DOES HE DO?

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.400
- HE'S IN THE ARMY.
HE'S SPECIAL FORCES.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.800
- RIGHT.
- SO THEY'RE THE GUYS THAT

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.300
WEAR THE GREEN BERETS, AND--
- RIGHT.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.166
[cheers and applause]
- YES, UM...

00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:59.500
A LOT OF WHAT HE DOES IS REALLY
SECRET, SO..

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.666
- LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE HE
IS OR WHAT HE'S DOING RIGHT NOW.

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.300
- RIGHT NOW,
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.300
WE CALL IT "THE WOODS,"
AFFECTIONATELY.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.166
SO, THAT JUST MEANS HE'S OFF
THE GRID SOMEWHERE.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.100
- RIGHT.
- HE'S BEEN IN FOR ABOUT

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.300
10 YEARS,
AND UH--WELL, CLOSE TO 10 YEARS,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.133
AND GONE ON A LOT OF
DEPLOYMENTS, AND

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:17.100
RIGHT NOW HE'S TRAINING GUYS TO
BECOME SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIERS.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.500
- WOW, AMAZING.
- WE'RE PROUD OF HIM.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.966
AND YOU'RE APART A LOT,
AND YOU HAVE--WHAT--

00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:23.000

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.133

00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:28.066
- OH MY GOSH!

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:32.133
I DO, THEY'RE MASON AND JACKSON.
THEY'RE TWO AND FIVE.

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.600
OH! SORRY.
- AND YOU STAY HOME

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.633
AND TAKE CARE OF THEM.
- I AM, I'M A STAY-AT-HOME MOM.

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:37.966
- WHAT DID YOU DO BEFORE THIS?
- I WAS A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER,

00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:41.466
AND AFTER WE HAD THE LITTLE ONE,
JACKSON,

00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:43.666
MY TEACHING SALARY JUST COULDN'T
COVER DAY CARE FOR BOTH.

00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:45.466
- RIGHT.
- SO, I STAYED HOME WITH THEM.

00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:46.600
- YOU STAY AT HOME AND TAKE CARE
OF THEM.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.800
- YEAH, RUN AFTER THEM,
ALL DAY LONG.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.833
- RIGHT.
- AND...YEAH, IT'S GREAT.

00:01:50.833 --> 00:01:52.433
- YEAH, IT'S A LOT OF JOY,
I'M SURE.

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:54.100
- IT IS.
- AND SO--BUT YOUR HUSBAND

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.766
WILL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS
THIS YEAR, RIGHT?

00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:57.333
- YEAH, HE'LL BE HOME IN ABOUT
10 DAYS.

00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:59.300
- OKAY, GOOD.
- SO, WE'RE EXCITED FOR THAT.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.366
WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO KNOWING
THAT HE'S GOING TO BE HOME.

00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:04.166
SO MUCH OF HIS JOB IS...

00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:06.033
UNPREDICTABLE, SO WE KNOW
HE'S GONNA BE HERE THIS YEAR.

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:07.433
- THAT'S FANTASTIC.
- WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

00:02:07.433 --> 00:02:09.000
- AND ESPECIALLY THE BOYS WILL
BE HAPPY TO HAVE HIM HOME.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.733
- YEAH! THEY'RE EXCITED.

00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:12.866
FOR HIM AND THE KIDS YET?

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:15.866
- WELL, WE'RE NOT DOING PRESENTS
FOR EACH OTHER, BECAUSE,

00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:19.233
JUST ON HIS INCOME ALONE, WE
WOULD RATHER SPEND ON THE KIDS.

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:20.600
- YEAH.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.666
- WE HAVE DONE A VERY
LITTLE BIT.

00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:24.600
I MEAN, IT'S HARD--
- YEAH.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.733
- AND MY OLDER SON IS IN SCHOOL
NOW, AND HE'S ASKING FOR

00:02:28.733 --> 00:02:30.366
ALL THE BIG STUFF.
- RIGHT.

00:02:30.366 --> 00:02:33.100
- BUT I CAN'T--WE CAN'T DO THAT,
SO, HE'LL HAVE SOME PRESENTS

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.133
UNDER THE TREE.
- OKAY, WELL, GOOD.

00:02:35.133 --> 00:02:36.966
- MAYBE NOT THE ONES THEY WANT.
- RIGHT.

00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:38.866
WELL, MAYBE AND MAYBE NOT.
BUT FOR YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND,

00:02:38.866 --> 00:02:41.566
I FEEL LIKE YOU ALL SHOULD HAVE
SOMETHING, SO

00:02:41.566 --> 00:02:44.533
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A $2,000
NORDSTROM GIFT CARD
