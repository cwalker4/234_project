00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.390
There’s a saying that truth is stranger
than fiction, and this has never been more

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.800
true than news headlines starring the Florida
Man.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.440
Weird events happen all over the world, but
for some reason, a whole other level of strange

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.350
seems to be concentrated in the state of Florida.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.840
Taken out of context, stories about Florida
Man sound like the world’s worst superhero,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.080
but it’s really just a bunch of guys doing
a lot of stupid things.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.369

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.470
Florida Man Prints Counterfeit Money at His
Local Library

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.280
Creating realistic counterfeit money is actually
a very intricate process.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.390
US dollar bills are made out of strips of
woven fabric, and they contain fine microscopic

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.860
details and holographic chips for added security.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.050
Even though it should be obvious that it’s
nearly impossible to make fake money, that

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.660
didn’t stop Florida Man from trying.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:58.440
Earlier this month, a 29-year-old man named
Levy Newberry found a template for counterfeit

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.120
money on Pinterest.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.370
He went to his public library in Pasco County,
Florida to use their printer to make hundred-dollar

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.100
bills on regular printer paper.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.400
He posted his misdeed on Facebook, using his
real account, and he actually found another

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.860
brilliant Florida resident who was willing
to pay $250 in real cash in exchange for $500

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.070
in fake money.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.210
Newberry then used the flimsy paper fakes
to pay his rent.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.750
His landlord could clearly see that this money
was counterfeit, so they called the police,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.690
and he was taken into custody.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.740

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.670
Florida Man Called 911 After His Cat Was Denied
Entry Into Strip Club

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.590
In June 2012, a man named Everett Lages was
trying to spend a night in the Emerald City

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.710
Gentlemen’s Club in Murdock, Florida.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.800
He must have pre-gamed a little bit too hard
beforehand, because he was already highly

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.750
intoxicated and and carrying a kitten.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.479
The bouncers refused to let him inside with
an animal.

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.172
This made him so angry that he sat down outside
of the club and called 911 over and over again,

00:01:57.172 --> 00:02:01.860
hoping that the police would ignore health
code violations and escort him inside.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.640
When the police arrived, they calmly tried
to get him to go home.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.490
To their credit, they knew this guy was just
too drunk to function, and offered to call

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.490
him a taxi.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.830
He refused, and started making a scene.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.650
He continued to call 911, even though the
cops were standing right there.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.700
They had no choice but to arrest him for calling
911 for a non-emergency, disorderly intoxication,

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.280
and trespassing on a property after being
asked to leave.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.440
Lages was held on a $4,000 bail, and his kitten
was given to the local animal shelter.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.440

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.450
Florida Man Arrested After Chasing Down Neighbor
With a Tractor

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.510
In most states, if two property owners have
a disagreement about where their property

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.740
line begins and ends, the issue can be solved
by contacting their local municipality.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.380
But in Florida, apparently nothing is ever
that simple.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.510
In July 2018, a man named Scott Lynch was
concerned when his 72-year-old neighbor, Howell

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.390
Morris, started to use his tractor on Lynch’s
property, destroying what he believed to be

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.390
his land.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.330
He was also blocking Lynch’s driveway, so
Lynch walked over to ask him to move.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.040
Instead of moving his tractor like a reasonable
person, Morris pushed the machine into gear

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.731
and started chasing after Lynch, who started
running for his life.

00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:18.900
Lynch’s wife caught it all on her cell phone
camera and called 911.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.620
Morris was later arrested for aggravated assault.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.620

Florida Man Recovers From a Nervous Breakdown
With Chuck E. Cheese Robots

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.770
As a boy, Jared Sanchez’s happiest memories
were going to Chuck E. Cheese with his family.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.980
His favorite animatronic character was one
called “The King,” which was an Elvis

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.620
impersonator in the form of an anthropomorphic
lion.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.239
One day, he came into the restaurant to see
that The King was gone.

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.739
For the next 20 years of his life, he wondered
if he would ever see his favorite character

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:47.739
again.

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.050
As an adult, he moved up the ranks of retail
from starting as a Walmart stocking clerk

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.840
to eventually landing a supervisory position
making well over $90,000 a year.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.170
While his life seemed like a success, he began
to feel the stress of firing people on a regular

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.170
basis.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.470
He admits that he couldn’t handle the job,
and ended up having a nervous breakdown.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.910
He had to take time off from work to recover.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.860
Sanchez found The King on eBay, and paid $10,000
to bring it into his Tampa home.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.950
Since then, he has transformed the master
bedroom of his house into a studio for The

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.139
King and decorated the space to look like
the inside of a Chuck E. Cheese.

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.770
Sanchez says that by bringing The King back
to life, he hopes that maybe someday, the

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.490
character can be made into the star of a kids’
TV show.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.050
For now, he uploads his own videos of the
robot on YouTube.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.050

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.889
Florida Man Doesn’t Remember Carrying a
Live Alligator Into a Store to Buy Beer

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.409
If you’re old enough to drink, you’ve
probably had at least one night where things

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:42.789
got a little out of hand.

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.289
But it’s likely that none of you can top
Floridian Bobby Stratton.

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:52.419
During a complete blackout, he found a live
alligator, picked it up, and carried it under

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.059
his arm into a convenience store.

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:57.020
While he was shopping, he bought an 18-pack
of beer.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.229
Later, when he was confronted by the police,
he claims that he did not remember the events

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.690
of that night at all.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.379
He was so blackout drunk that he had no idea
where they alligator came from.

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:09.230
He told the local news that maybe he would
go to jail, or maybe not.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.059
He didn’t seem to care either way.

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:15.689
After all, once you’ve made a beer run with
an alligator it’s all downhill from there

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:16.689
anyway.

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:17.689

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:21.080
Florida Man Tries To Rob A Store By Pointing
His Finger Like a Gun

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.979
It was 2:00 a.m. in February 2018 at a 7-11
convenience store in Bonita Beach, Florida.

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.009
An underpaid sales clerk was working the night
shift when Florida Man burst through the door

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.119
with a shirt covering his face, and his finger
pointed like a gun.

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:34.229
He demanded all of the money in the register.

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:35.729
The cashier simply said “No.”

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.740
This was enough for Florida Man to give up.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.800
He didn’t take anything, and ran out of
the store to jump on his bicycle.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.289
Let’s just hope he took the shirt off of
his face first, so he could see in the dark.

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:49.059
No one was hurt, but the local police still
offered a $1,000 reward for any information

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:50.749
that may lead to his arrest.

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:51.749

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:54.749
Florida Man Steals 11 Zoo Animals And Hides
Them In His Home

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:56.180
Now, we know what you’re thinking.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.520
How on Earth could someone steal 11 zoo animals
without being noticed?

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.990
Well… they were turtles.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.639
Oh, and Florida Man took a squirrel monkey,
too, because… why not?

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.969
And no, the culprit wasn’t the zombie-faced
boy who said “I like turtles.”

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.770
This was a 20-year old Gainesville, Florida
resident named Sedrick T. Price.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.839
He went to the Santa Fe College Teaching Zoo,
where students learn how to be zookeepers.

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:19.249
When the police raided his apartment, they
could only find 7 of the 11 missing animals,

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:22.860
so it’s possible that Price was selling
them to rare animal collectors at roughly

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.699
$100 apiece.

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:25.699

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:28.289
Florida Man Donates His Loaded Grenade Launcher
to Goodwill

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:33.529
It’s not that uncommon for people to accidentally
donate valuable things to a thrift store,

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:35.710
especially when they are in the process of
moving.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.469
But in Florida, one employee of the Bradenton
Goodwill discovered a fully loaded grenade

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:40.469
launcher.

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:44.819
Now, it’s usually someone’s job to at
Goodwill test if things still work in the

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:45.819
back room.

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:48.629
None of the employees apparently wanted to
deal with the drama, so they would just pass

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:50.729
it around to the next store location.

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:52.689
Eventually, one Goodwill manager interfered.

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:56.790
They had no way of knowing what genius of
a Florida Man actually donated the grenade

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.800
launcher, so they had to hand it over to the
Bradenton police department.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.360
It now sits in their armory.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.360
2.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.550
Florida Man Steals 850 Pairs of Underwear
From Victoria’s Secret

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.319
Daniel Espinosa likes panties, and sneaking
just one or two pairs off the store shelf

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:12.529
wasn’t enough.

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:20.430
He stole a total of $15,475 worth of underwear
from Victoria’s Secret before getting caught.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:24.509
He was seen by the security cameras, of course,
after making three separate trips.

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:29.369
He didn’t work alone, however, as an unnamed
juvenile codefendant was reportedly also involved.

00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:33.479
The codefendant, apparently, stole more than
$76,000 worth of property (it’s unclear

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:38.250
if it came solely from Victoria’s Secret,
or if he branched out to other forms of theft).

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:43.050
At the end of the hearing, the judge said,
“Please… don’t come back to Victoria’s

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.050
Secret.”

Florida Man Steals a Chainsaw By Stuffing
It Down His Pants

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.639
When you imagine stealing something from a
store, it would only make sense to slip something

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.490
into your pocket that could go undetected.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:08:00.779
But, come on… a Florida Man doesn’t do
things half-assed.

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:06.801
In November 2014, a 27-year-old named Anthony
Ballard stole a chainsaw by shoving it down

00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:09.619
his pants, and using his t-shirt to cover
it up.

00:08:09.619 --> 00:08:13.550
You probably just winced at the notion of
a freaking chainsaw being shoved down your

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:14.869
pants, especially if you’re male.

00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:18.639
This was all caught on camera, and one of
the employees could clearly see the bulging

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:20.680
chainsaw through his clothes.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.869
An employee chased him, and the bulky saw
was too much for Ballard to carry and run

00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:26.539
at the same time, so he dropped it.

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:43.120
They called the police, who were able to catch
Ballard and charge him with

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:49.570
grand theft.
