00:00:07.888 --> 00:00:09.367
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.624 --> 00:00:19.040
Well, thanks, Martin, for that
very generous introduction.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.330
That was very kind of you.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.050
So it was actually 5 and
1/2 years ago almost now

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.114
that CERN announced to
the world they discovered

00:00:26.114 --> 00:00:28.280
a new-- what they cautiously
described at the time--

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.070
as a new boson, which
we've now sort of fairly

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.770
confidently concluded is
at least a Higgs boson.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.764
And around that time,
suddenly particle physics

00:00:35.764 --> 00:00:36.680
was all over the news.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.140
Brian Cox was wheeled into
every television studio

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.550
to explain to slightly
bemused-looking TV anchors

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.947
what spontaneous
symmetry breaking was.

00:00:44.947 --> 00:00:47.030
And then everyone sort of
moved on with our lives,

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.050
and forgot about us.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.420
And you might be forgiven for
thinking that actually, we

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.330
put our feet up at CERN and just
had a holiday for the last five

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.830
years.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.480
Because there hasn't really
been another big breakthrough,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.220
at least not one
that's got in the news.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.470
So what I want to talk
to you about today

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.450
is what we actually
have been up to.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.319
And particularly,
there's something quite--

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.480
it's true there hasn't been a
really big breakthrough yet.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.550
But just in the
last year or two,

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.680
there have been some
really intriguing signs

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.110
that we might be-- and being
very cautious about this--

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.720
we might be about to discover
something really quite

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.590
profound.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.260
So this is CERN,
which is the European

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.570
Organisation for Nuclear
Research just outside Geneva.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.980
It's a sort of the
size of a small town.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.730
The population of CERN at any
one time is about 2,500 people.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.100
There are about 7,000
physicists from around the world

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.800
who are involved
in research there.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.430
And it's got everything that
a small town should have.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.800
It's got a restaurant.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.810
It's got a post
office, travel agents.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.910
It's got hotels.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.282
It's a kind of town populated
exclusively, though,

00:01:46.282 --> 00:01:47.240
by particle physicists.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.323
So you can kind of imagine
what that must be like.

00:01:49.323 --> 00:01:50.498
[CROWD LAUGHS]

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.930
This was the scene in the
main auditorium at CERN

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.420
on the 4th of July, 2012.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.540
Now, this is as excited
as you will ever see

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.750
particle physicists getting.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.570
They were sort of
clapping, cheering,

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.220
people punching the air.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.310
One of the people in
the crowd described it

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.881
as being like at
a football match.

00:02:09.881 --> 00:02:11.880
I'm not sure he'd ever
been to a football match.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.980
But, I mean, it
was certainly very

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.690
lively by physics standards.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.190
And this is what they
were all cheering.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.170
There was a bump.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.350
So physicists get very
excited about bumps.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.630
If you want to know what
a Higgs boson looks like,

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.790
this is basically what a
Higgs boson looks like.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.870
It looks like a bump in a graph.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.565
So I'll explain
actually what this shows

00:02:30.565 --> 00:02:31.690
a bit later in the lecture.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.510
But really, the thing
you're looking for here

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.176
is, there is this
smoothly falling line.

00:02:35.176 --> 00:02:37.860
And then there's this
little, tiny excess here.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.690
And that was the
smoking gun telling us

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.106
that there was a
new particle that

00:02:41.106 --> 00:02:43.530
had been found which,
over the last few years,

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.000
has been almost
certainly confirmed

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.660
to be the Higgs boson that Peter
Higgs predicted back in 1964.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.657
So what is a Higgs
boson, you might ask.

00:02:52.657 --> 00:02:54.240
And that's a very
reasonable question.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.010
So I'm going to very
briefly take you

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.290
on a quick tour of
particle physics

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.720
to try and understand what
this thing actually is.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.785
So let's start with maybe
something slightly more

00:03:02.785 --> 00:03:03.285
familiar.

00:03:03.285 --> 00:03:07.050
So this is the periodic table
of the chemical elements which

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.920
dates back to the 19th century.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.570
So at the end of
the 19th century,

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.090
the understood theory of what
the universe is made from

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.970
is, there are more than a
hundred different chemical

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:18.930
elements.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.165
And thanks to Dalton's
atomic theory,

00:03:22.165 --> 00:03:24.790
what he said was that for every
element-- hydrogen, and helium,

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.800
lithium and so on--

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.610
there was a atom, which was
a fundamental, indivisible,

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.660
indestructible little thing.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.147
And you had different atoms,
one for every element.

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:35.730
So that was the sort
of Victorian view

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.430
of the nature of matter.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.270
So here's your atom.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.810
Then at the turn of the 20th
century-- so 1897, actually,

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.300
the Cavendish Laboratory,
where I work--

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.810
a particle was discovered.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.590
The first elementary
particle that we found,

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.760
called the electron.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.680
And that led over
the next few years

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.564
to a revision of the
structure of the atoms.

00:03:54.564 --> 00:03:55.980
So the atom, as I
said before, was

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.115
thought to be something hard,
indestructible, indivisible.

00:03:59.115 --> 00:04:01.240
When the electron was
discovered, that was revised.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.180
And we get the model
of the atom that we all

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.140
learn about in school, which
is a nucleus which contains

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.595
most of the mass of the atom.

00:04:08.595 --> 00:04:10.430
And that's positively charged.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.980
And around the atom
go these electrons.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.310
Now, the periodic table if
you look at it in the way

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.200
that the elements
were arranged, there

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.922
are certain patterns
in the properties

00:04:20.922 --> 00:04:22.380
of the different
chemical elements.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.810
So, for example, if you look
at the group 1 elements,

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.120
they all tend to
react in similar ways.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.930
And they get more
reactive as you go down.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.370
But there are clear
patterns in the way

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.453
the elements are arranged.

00:04:31.453 --> 00:04:34.175
And that was sort of indicative
of some deeper structure.

00:04:34.175 --> 00:04:35.550
And this is the
deeper structure.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.710
So essentially you can
explain the properties

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.140
of all these different
elements by different numbers

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.300
of electrons going around
the outside of atoms.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.070
And those electrons
are what determine

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.250
the chemical properties of
that particular element.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.880
Now, this isn't the
end of the story.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.090
So if you zoom into
the nucleus, it

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.560
was discovered in sort
of the early 1930s

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.210
that the nucleus itself
is made of smaller things.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.850
And these are called
protons and neutrons.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.290
So these are smaller
parts, smaller particles,

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.430
which make up most of
the mass of the atom.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.100
The proton is
positively charged.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.870
The neutron is
electrically neutral.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.620
They're much, much
heavier than electrons.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.030
They're about 2,000 times
more massive than electrons.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.670
Now, this may be where
your sort of school physics

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.620
ended, possibly.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.750
But in the 1960s,
it was discovered

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.030
that actually protons and
neutrons themselves are not

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.660
fundamental.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.520
They're made of
even smaller things.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.280
And those smaller things
are what we call quarks.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.950
Quarks, depending on your taste.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.670
So the proton is made
of two up quarks--

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.460
which are these red
triangles-- and one down quark.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.940
And the neutron is made of two
down quarks and one up quark.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.720
And that's it.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.090
So that basically says
that all of matter--

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.970
every atom in the universe,
everything that we know about--

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.950
is made up, actually,
of just three

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.020
different elementary particles.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.300
So you have the
electron, first of all,

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.210
discovered by JJ Thomson
in Cambridge in 1897.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.020
And the two quarks, the up
quark and the down quark.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.460
So everything that exists
is made of just these three

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.960
things.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.250
So you are just
quarks and electrons

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.796
arranged in a rather
peculiar way, essentially.

00:06:07.796 --> 00:06:09.420
And these are the
first three particles

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.319
of what we call
the Standard Model.

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:13.110
Now, the Standard Model
of particle physics

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.930
is a rather boring name for
something quite extraordinary.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.720
It's really the closest we
have to a complete description

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.466
of the universe at
the fundamental level.

00:06:21.466 --> 00:06:23.340
Well, it misses quite
a few things, actually.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.480
But the main thing
that you might

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.400
be familiar with that it
doesn't include is gravity.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.800
But other than that, it's got
it pretty well pinned down.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.258
So you've got these
three particles

00:06:30.258 --> 00:06:32.640
that make up all the
matter that we're made of.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.510
Then there's something else that
gets added to this table called

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.320
a neutrino.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.890
Neutrinos are sort
of like ghosts.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.750
They're these invisible,
almost undetectable particles.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.570
There are trillions of them
going through you right now.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.740
They're produced by the
sun in vast quantities.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.380
They go straight through you,
straight through the earth.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.735
And they very, very rarely
interact with the ordinary

00:06:51.735 --> 00:06:52.985
matter that we're made out of.

00:06:52.985 --> 00:06:55.401
So that's why we're not really
that aware of the existence

00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:57.300
of neutrinos most of the time.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.870
So this column of four
particles makes up

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.440
what we call the first
generation of matter.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.680
Now for some reason which
we do not understand,

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.859
nature provided us with
two additional copies

00:07:09.859 --> 00:07:10.650
of these particles.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.770
There's something called
the second generation.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.990
And in the second
generation, all the particles

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.750
are exactly the same as
in the first generation

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.300
except they're more massive,
and they're unstable.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.990
So, for example, the
electron has a sort

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.980
of heavy cousin called the
muon, which is about 200 times

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.900
more massive than the electron.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.629
And the reason we're
not made of muons

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:33.170
and there aren't
muons hanging around

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.700
is because if you
make a muon, it

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.850
will very quickly decay into
an electron and some neutrinos.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.504
So these second
generation particles

00:07:40.504 --> 00:07:41.670
don't hang around very long.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.294
They're unstable,
but you can make them

00:07:43.294 --> 00:07:47.064
in high-energy collisions
like at the LHC, for example.

00:07:47.064 --> 00:07:48.480
Then there's the
third generation,

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.210
which is even heavier.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.800
So these are-- what is this?

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.470
4x3.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.060
12 particles are the
matter particles.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.570
So they make up the kind of
solid stuff of the universe,

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:00.260
essentially.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.240
Or, at least, they would if
they weren't all unstable apart

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.404
from this first column.

00:08:03.404 --> 00:08:05.570
And we do not know-- it is
a big mystery-- we do not

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.290
know why there are two
extra columns in this table.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:11.960
It's a bit like the periodic
table in a way where

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.900
you have this sort of structure
and you can see these patterns.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.150
But you don't actually
understand yet-- back

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.340
in the 19th century--
what underlies this.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.162
But there's something
suggestive here.

00:08:21.162 --> 00:08:23.120
Something that sort of
hints that maybe there's

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.460
some deeper structure
that could explain

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.550
why we've got this rather
peculiar set of matter

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.480
particles.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.037
And I'll come back to
that in a little bit.

00:08:32.037 --> 00:08:34.120
And then the last ingredient
in the Standard Model

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.460
are the force particles.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:39.909
So there are three fundamental
forces in the Standard Model.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:41.437
Probably the most
familiar to you--

00:08:41.437 --> 00:08:44.020
and one that a lot of important
work was done in this building

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.590
on-- is electromagnetism.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.110
So by Faraday, and Maxwell,
and various others.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:51.280
So that's the force that
causes electrons to stick

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.300
to the nuclei of atoms.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.530
It binds atoms together.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.222
It's responsible for chemistry.

00:08:55.222 --> 00:08:57.430
It's responsible for basically
most of the stuff that

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:58.960
is important to us.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.900
And the particle that transmits
the electromagnetic interaction

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.590
is the photon, the
particle of light.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:07.240
So light itself is also an
electromagnetic phenomenon.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.150
Then there are three
other particles which

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.600
you may not have heard of.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.080
There's something
called the gluon which

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.790
is the force particle
of something called

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.630
the strong nuclear force, which
is a force that binds quarks

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.190
together inside
the atomic nucleus.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.020
And binds protons and
neutrons together.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.610
And it's called a gluon because
it glues things, essentially.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.740
And then there's two rather
weird ones called the W and Z

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:30.370
particles.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.940
And these are
particles that transmit

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.660
a third force, an
even weirder one

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.720
called the weak nuclear force.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.470
Now, the weak nuclear
force doesn't really

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.960
bind things together
like electromagnetism

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.410
or the strong force.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.260
This force is responsible for
causing particles to decay.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.950
So when a muon turns
into an electron,

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.774
that happens through
the weak force.

00:09:49.774 --> 00:09:51.690
And I'll talk a bit more
about the weak force.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.650
It's very important, the weak
force, although we don't really

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:54.940
notice it in our daily lives.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.620
If it wasn't there,
the sun wouldn't

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.536
be able to fuse
hydrogen into helium.

00:09:58.536 --> 00:10:00.410
And there would be no
matter in the universe.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.920
So it's very important, even
though it's not something

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.984
we're very familiar with.

00:10:04.984 --> 00:10:06.150
So this is a Standard Model.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.040
And this was the
Standard Model as had

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.740
been sort of
studied and observed

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.900
on the 3rd of July, 2012.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.790
And on the 3rd of
July, 2012, there

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:19.210
was one piece missing
which was this, the Higgs.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:22.810
So, what is this
Higgs boson thing,

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:24.280
and why is it so important?

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.940
Well, to understand
that, we actually

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.640
need to ask a slightly deeper
question which is, what do I

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.650
actually mean by a particle?

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.162
So you could be forgiven.

00:10:33.162 --> 00:10:35.620
The way I've described this to
you in the last few minutes,

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.230
you could get the idea that
maybe these particles are

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.270
somehow like little
LEGO bricks, or they're

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:40.590
a bit like the Victorian atoms.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.780
They're sort of
solid little points

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.620
that move around
and stick together.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.280
But actually, that's not
what modern particle physics

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.480
tells us particles are.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.780
In fact, particles aren't
really what matters at all.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.730
Our field is kind of
badly named in sense.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.600
What actually we think
of as being fundamental

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.155
are not particles but fields.

00:11:02.496 --> 00:11:03.870
If you've ever
held a magnet next

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.060
to a piece of steel
or iron, you've

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.220
felt the effect of a field.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.720
So a field is something that
can cause, for example, a force

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.670
to be exerted over a
distance where there's

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.490
no physical stuff actually
causing that force

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.949
to be exerted.

00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:18.990
A field can be, so for
example, a magnetic field.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.044
And that can be
strong near a magnet,

00:11:21.044 --> 00:11:22.710
and get weaker as you
move further away.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:24.251
Or it could be a
gravitational field,

00:11:24.251 --> 00:11:26.460
like the one that the
earth creates around it,

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.940
or the sun creates around it.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.030
In particle physics, every
one of these particles

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.500
has an associated field.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.740
So there is a field for the
quarks, for the electrons,

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.740
for the neutrinos, and for
all the force particles.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.780
And the way we think
of these particles

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.880
are actually as
little tiny ripples

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.230
moving through these fields.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.700
So this is a rather nice
cartoon by one of my colleagues

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:50.520
at Cambridge.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.300
David Tong is a
theoretical physicist.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.854
So, here you've got your
fields, this kind of blue sheet.

00:11:54.854 --> 00:11:57.270
And then here you've got some
particles having a punch up.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:01.350
So they're kind of these little
localised disturbances in these

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:02.220
fields.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.110
And that's how we
think of all matter.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:07.499
So electrons, quarks,
everything are just

00:12:07.499 --> 00:12:09.540
little ripples moving
through these cosmic energy

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.270
fields that fill all of
space and are everywhere.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.070
Which is quite a
sort of strange idea,

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.672
but that's really how
we think things are.

00:12:16.672 --> 00:12:18.630
So coming back to the
Higgs, what is the Higgs?

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.900
Well, the problem
existed in the 1960s.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.630
When the Standard Model
was being put together,

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.520
it was discovered
that if you tried

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.090
to make the particles in
the Standard Model massive,

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:31.820
then the theory broke down.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.270
It'd give you
nonsensical answers.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:36.480
So, in particular, there was a
particular problem with these W

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.150
and Z particles, these
particles that transmit

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.770
the weak nuclear force.

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.540
It was known that
if they existed,

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.310
they had to be
extremely massive.

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:47.357
But if you gave them mass
in the theory, the theory

00:12:47.357 --> 00:12:48.690
it gave you nonsensical answers.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:51.024
So there had to be
some solution to this.

00:12:51.024 --> 00:12:52.440
And the solution
was, essentially,

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.820
to invent another field.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.180
So just like the other fields
that these particles are

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.490
ripples moving about in,
what Peter Higgs essentially

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.906
said-- and, actually, five
other colleagues he was working

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:03.720
with round about
the same time-- was,

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.720
imagine that there is
throughout the entire universe

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.870
an additional cosmic
quantum field.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.970
And as these massive
particles-- these things

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:13.950
that we think are
massive-- move through it,

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.870
actually they are imbued
with mass by this field.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.840
So, for example, the electron--
which has a certain mass--

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.830
what the Higgs mechanism
tells us is actually,

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.570
the electron is mass-less.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.150
But by interacting with
this cosmic energy field,

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:30.360
it acquires the
property of mass.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.399
So Higgs wrote his
paper in early 1964.

00:13:33.399 --> 00:13:35.190
And he had this idea
which was written down

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.950
with very elegant mathematics,
which looks a bit like this.

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.830
And don't worry, I won't try
and explain what this means.

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.360
And he sent it off
to the journal,

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.400
and his paper was rejected.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.710
They basically said, this
has nothing whatsoever

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.310
to do with physics.

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:52.100
So Peter Higgs here, nice maths
but nothing to do with reality.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.720
So Peter Higgs went
back to his paper

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.460
and he said, well,
I need to connect

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.055
this with something that could
be experimentally measured.

00:13:59.055 --> 00:14:00.930
And what he added to
his paper was, actually,

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:04.470
basically one line that said,
if this cosmic energy field that

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.990
gives mass to all the
particles exists, then

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.210
you should be able
to create a ripple

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.340
or a disturbance in
it which would show up

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.449
as a new particle.

00:14:12.449 --> 00:14:14.490
And that thing-- that
ripple in the Higgs field--

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.920
is what we call the
Higgs, the Higgs boson.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.770
So the thing that gives mass
to the particles we're made

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:21.630
of, at least, is this field.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.430
And the Higgs
really is the proof

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.140
that this field is out there.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.360
And that's why finding
it was so important,

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.630
because the Higgs mechanism--
this Higgs process by which

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.820
the particles get
mass-- is absolutely

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.350
fundamental to the
Standard Model.

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:36.520
It's kind of like the
keystone in an arch.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.840
If you take it away, the whole
theory just falls in on itself.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.480
People were almost kind
of convinced, actually,

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.670
that this thing
must be out there.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.690
And that's why finding
it was so, so crucial.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.330
And why everyone
got so excited back

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.390
on that day on the 4th of July.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.370
So with the discovery
of the Higgs,

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.715
this completes the Standard
Model of particle physics

00:14:55.715 --> 00:14:57.210
that I've been
telling you about.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.420
And this theory is really a
kind of incredible achievement,

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.940
actually, because it can be
used to pretty much explain

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.830
all the physics that
we can see around us.

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.650
So you can use this
animal in principle

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:12.730
to describe everything from how
a light bulb produces photons

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:16.630
to how atoms are fused
together inside stars.

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.730
It's the closest
we have, as I said,

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:20.770
to a theory of everything.

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:23.710
To give you a sense of
the predictive power

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.054
of this theory, this is--

00:15:26.054 --> 00:15:27.970
actually, what I'm going
to tell you about now

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:32.110
is the best scientific
prediction anywhere in science,

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.330
as far as I'm aware.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:34.330
So, here's the electron.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.930
Now the electron as well
as having electric charge

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.630
also behaves a bit like
it's a tiny bar magnet.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.520
So it has a north
and a south pole,

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.190
and it gives off
a magnetic field.

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:47.530
And you can use a Standard
Model to calculate

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.650
how strong the electron's
little bar magnet should be.

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:52.900
And you can do this to
absolutely fantastic precision.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.480
So essentially what you do
is, you use a supercomputer.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.100
You put the theory
into the computer,

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.080
and you calculate, and
you get a number that

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:05.080
looks like this, 11596521807.3
plus or minus 2.8 times 10

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:05.755
to the minus 13.

00:16:05.755 --> 00:16:08.590
So it's a very small number,
but very precisely calculated

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.600
with a very small uncertainty.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.445
This is your
theoretical prediction.

00:16:12.445 --> 00:16:14.320
Now if you do a very,
very clever experiment,

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.355
you can measure
this quantity-- it's

00:16:16.355 --> 00:16:19.219
a very, very tiny quantity--
to a very high accuracy.

00:16:19.219 --> 00:16:20.260
And this is what you get.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:25.430
11596521817.8 plus or minus 7.6.

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.524
So you can see, these
numbers agree right down

00:16:27.524 --> 00:16:29.440
to the last sort of three
significant figures.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.780
And the difference between
this number and this number

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.660
is within the
experimental uncertainty

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.750
on this measurement.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:37.660
So this is a prediction
and a measurement

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.090
accurate to one
part in a billion.

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.370
That is really kind
of extraordinary.

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:46.630
So that tells you that this
Standard Model is definitely

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:47.440
on to something.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.840
I mean, you don't get this
kind of result by accident.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.695
So its a really stunningly
successful theory, but it

00:16:53.695 --> 00:16:55.840
is not without some problems.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.880
And these problems are
actually what motivated,

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.210
in part, the building
of the Large Hadron

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:02.752
Collider in the
first place, as well

00:17:02.752 --> 00:17:04.210
as the discovery
of the Higgs which

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:06.670
is really kind of closing
the chapter of 20th century

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:07.280
physics.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.994
What everyone was
actually really after--

00:17:08.994 --> 00:17:10.410
well, a lot of
people were after--

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:12.670
were answers to some big,
unsolved questions that

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.619
the Standard Model
cannot address.

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:16.339
Now, I'll go back
to this picture.

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:19.839
So this is actually an image
taken by the Hubble Space

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:20.619
Telescope.

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:22.568
It's called the Hubble
Ultra-Deep Field.

00:17:22.568 --> 00:17:24.609
And what essentially it
is is where the telescope

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:28.650
is pointed at a very
dark patch of sky, where

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:29.890
there are almost no stars.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:31.690
And you wait for
a very long time

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.720
and wait for
extremely faint light

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.940
to build up on the
sensor of the telescope.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.920
And eventually, this is
the image that you get.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.019
So what you can
see in this image,

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:42.310
there are actually a few stars.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.920
They're the things with the
kind of cross twinkie patterns.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.290
But everything else,
pretty much, is a galaxy.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:50.590
These are extremely
distant galaxies, sort of

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:55.217
almost out to the edge of as far
as we can see with telescopes.

00:17:55.217 --> 00:17:57.050
So, for example, in the
centre of the image,

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:59.133
you can see there's a kind
of cluster of galaxies,

00:17:59.133 --> 00:18:00.460
these kind of blobs.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.960
Now, hopefully you should
be able to also see

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.400
that on this image, there
is this smearing pattern.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.540
So there's kind of these
circular structures arranged

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:14.320
around this central
cluster of galaxies.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.350
And what this smearing
is, is something

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.880
called gravitational lensing.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:25.040
So this is essentially where
light from a distant galaxy

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.270
travels towards the earth.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:29.930
Now thanks to Einstein, we
know that gravity doesn't just

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.180
make matter move in
orbits or curves.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.800
It also curves
space time, and it

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.190
will cause light to
travel in curved paths.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:40.175
So what's actually happening
is imagine you have your--

00:18:40.175 --> 00:18:43.230
if my galaxy is here and
the Earth's over there,

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:46.970
and there's something heavy
in between me, the galaxy,

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:48.020
and the earth over there.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.570
As the light leaves
the galaxy and travels

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:53.030
past this heavy object,
it's bent by its gravity

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.802
and pulled back towards
the earth again.

00:18:54.802 --> 00:18:57.260
And what you end up getting,
it basically acts like a lens.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.810
And you end up getting this
kind of smeared multiple image

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:03.030
of the same galaxy
across the whole sky.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:05.030
And this lensing effect
can actually, therefore,

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:09.037
be used to work out how much
matter there is in the centre

00:19:09.037 --> 00:19:09.620
of this image.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.740
Because the more gravity,
the more mass there is here,

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.870
the more strongly lensed
the light will be.

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.092
And the more pronounced
this effect will be.

00:19:18.092 --> 00:19:20.050
So what you can do is,
if you use this lensing,

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.740
you can work out how
much mass, effectively,

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.710
there is in the
centre of this image.

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.530
And then you compare that
with the visible light

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:28.250
that you can see.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.630
So we can see there are
lots of galaxies here.

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:33.260
This is obviously a very
large amount of mass.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.860
And what you actually
find, though,

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:38.150
is that there is a very large
discrepancy between the amount

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:40.910
of stuff you can see with
your optical telescopes

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:43.550
and the amount of stuff
we know needs to be there

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:46.050
to explain this lensing effect.

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:48.459
And if you overlay a map
of where the matter appears

00:19:48.459 --> 00:19:50.750
to be in this image from
lensing, this is what you get.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.900
You get this kind of
bluish purple cloud.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:58.050
This is evidence of
something called dark matter,

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:01.400
which is essentially some
kind of invisible substance--

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.290
and which we don't
know what it is--

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.350
which apparently makes up a very
large fraction of the universe.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.420
In fact, it's far,
far more abundant

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.460
than the atomic matter,
the stuff the Standard

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.720
Model describes basically.

00:20:14.149 --> 00:20:16.190
So you have evidence of
dark matter from lensing.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:17.731
You also have evidence
of dark matter

00:20:17.731 --> 00:20:19.550
from simulations
like this, which

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:22.200
show how the universe
formed in the early stages.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.947
And essentially,
you find that if you

00:20:23.947 --> 00:20:26.030
want to show how structure
in the universe formed,

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:27.710
you need dark matter.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:29.900
If you don't put dark matter
into your simulations,

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.150
then you don't get a universe
that looks like the one

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:32.649
we live in.

00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:34.827
So this is from the
Illustris Simulation Group.

00:20:34.827 --> 00:20:35.660
Rather lovely thing.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.030
Anyway, you can sort of see
galaxies bursting to life

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.490
and stars turning on things.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:40.932
Really pretty.

00:20:40.932 --> 00:20:42.890
But you need the dark
matter to make this work,

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:46.610
and to agree with what we
see out there in the sky.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:49.900
And through these kinds of
techniques-- through lensing--

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.850
and also by looking at
the rotations of stars

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.490
around galaxies--
you can calculate

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.120
to a fairly high
degree of confidence

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.560
how much dark
matter is out there,

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.450
even though we can't see it.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:59.510
And this is what you get.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:01.570
This is our cosmic pie.

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:04.360
And essentially what you see
rather extraordinarily is this

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.370
slice here-- which
I've labelled atoms--

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:08.050
which is basically
us and everything

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:09.841
that we can see when
we look up at the sky.

00:21:09.841 --> 00:21:12.310
So all the galaxies, and stars,
and planets, the universe.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:15.490
And everything the Standard
Model describes is just 5%

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:18.310
of the total content
of the universe.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:22.180
27% of it-- so more than five
times more of the universe--

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.980
is made of this invisible
dark matter stuff.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.710
And we don't know what that is.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:30.250
And then 68% is something
called dark energy,

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:33.070
and we really don't
know what that is.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:37.600
So dark energy is some kind
of mysterious, repulsive force

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.480
that appears to be causing
the universe to expand

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.305
at an ever-increasing rate.

00:21:42.305 --> 00:21:43.930
So the lesson from
this is essentially,

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:45.550
when you hear the
word dark in physics,

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.675
you should get very suspicious
because it basically

00:21:47.675 --> 00:21:49.867
means we don't know what
we're talking about.

00:21:49.867 --> 00:21:51.700
And this is really an
extraordinary position

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.020
to find yourself in.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:56.080
You've constructed what seems
to be this stunningly successful

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.900
theory over a century with
all these clever experiments

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.040
and clever theories.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.440
And then you realise that
what you've been describing is

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.870
actually only a tiny
fraction of the total content

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:05.855
of the universe.

00:22:05.855 --> 00:22:07.480
So we're in this
extraordinary position

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.840
of having a theory
that works really,

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.339
really, really well in the very
narrow domain in which we've

00:22:11.339 --> 00:22:14.920
applied it, but tells us
basically nothing about 95%

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.830
of what's out there.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:19.010
So that is definitely
a bit of an omission,

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:22.415
I suppose you could say,
in the Standard Model.

00:22:22.415 --> 00:22:23.790
There are other
problems as well.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:26.040
So we don't know what
95% of the universe is.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.530
That's pretty big.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:30.470
Another one is to do with
something called antimatter.

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:33.020
So that table I showed
you at the beginning

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:36.150
with all the matter particles--
the quarks, the electrons,

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:38.150
and their cousins,
and the neutrinos--

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:39.950
for every one of
these particles,

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:43.002
there is a sort of a
mirror image particle.

00:22:43.002 --> 00:22:44.960
This has been known about
for a very long time.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.030
It was discovered
back in the 1930s,

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.272
predicted by someone
called Paul Dirac.

00:22:49.272 --> 00:22:51.230
And then discovered in
experiments very shortly

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:52.250
afterwards.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:54.130
Every particle in this
table, as I've said,

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.088
has a mirror image where
all the properties are

00:22:56.088 --> 00:22:58.520
exactly the same, but
the electric charge

00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.880
is the other way around.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.170
So, for example, the electron--
which is negatively charged--

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:06.110
has a positively charged
version called the positron,

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:08.700
or the antielectron
depending on what you prefer.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.220
And there's your
muons, antimuon.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.860
There's the up quark and the
anti-up quark, the down quark,

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.870
the anti-down quark, and so on.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.100
And these are also part
of the Standard Model.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.230
We know these things exist.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.271
They can be created very
reliably in experiments.

00:23:20.271 --> 00:23:21.640
Their properties are studied.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.360
And we know they're out there.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.997
And we also know that
they are actually

00:23:25.997 --> 00:23:27.830
indistinguishable from
the matter particles,

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:31.462
except for their charges
being the other way around.

00:23:31.462 --> 00:23:33.170
Now this is a bit of
a problem, actually,

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:37.010
because if you naively apply
this sort of understanding

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:39.815
of matter-antimatter to the
formation of the universe, then

00:23:39.815 --> 00:23:40.690
this is what happens.

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:44.490
So at the Big Bang, you have
a huge amount of energy.

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:48.440
And that energy is converted
into matter and antimatter.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.940
And in the Standard
Model, whenever

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.950
you make a matter
particle, you also

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:54.420
have to make the corresponding
antimatter particle.

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:58.806
So if you make an electron, you
also make with it the positron.

00:23:58.806 --> 00:24:01.430
And there's this cosmic kind of
maelstrom, all these particles,

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:02.604
antiparticles being created.

00:24:02.604 --> 00:24:04.520
And at the same time as
they're being created,

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.270
they're also bumping
back into each other,

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:08.512
and annihilating, and
turning back into lights.

00:24:08.512 --> 00:24:10.220
You have this interchange
between energy,

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.510
and matter, and antimatter.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.330
And it's boiling
and boiling away.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:17.130
And then eventually what happens
is the universe expands enough

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:20.840
that it cools down low enough
that all the matter-antimatter

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.410
meet up, annihilates,
and what you're left with

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:27.170
is a cold, dark, and
lifeless universe

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:31.861
with a few photons whizzing
through the infinite blackness.

00:24:31.861 --> 00:24:33.360
This is what the
Standard Model says

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.500
the universe should look like.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.400
This is what the universe
looks like, though.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.610
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:42.590
Copyright Lucasfilm.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.650
So the existence of stuff,
and us, and galaxies

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:49.205
is a bit of an inconvenience
if you're a theorist.

00:24:49.205 --> 00:24:50.580
We don't understand
that, either.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.400
So there must be
some kind of process

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:57.690
by which you can allow a little
bit more matter to survive

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:01.110
this cosmic annihilation at
the beginning of the universe.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:04.050
And actually, you
can work out how big

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:05.100
that imbalance has to be.

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.260
It only has to be
very, very tiny.

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.320
If you look at the sky and
count, essentially, the number

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.049
of photons whizzing
through space,

00:25:12.049 --> 00:25:14.340
there's a rough correspondence
between how many photons

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.130
there are out there and how
many particles and antiparticles

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:18.360
annihilated at the beginning.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.330
Because every annihilation more
or less creates two photons.

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.370
And there are about
a billion photons

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:25.360
for every atom in the universe.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.210
And what that tells
us is that, really, we

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:30.557
are one billionth leftover of
a much larger amount of stuff

00:25:30.557 --> 00:25:31.890
that was there at the beginning.

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:34.757
But we don't know how
this billionth survived.

00:25:34.757 --> 00:25:36.090
It shouldn't be there by rights.

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:39.595
It should have all been wiped
out, and we shouldn't be here.

00:25:39.595 --> 00:25:40.720
So that's two big problems.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.220
There's the fact we don't know
where 95% of the universe is.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:45.780
And, also, the theory tells us
the universe shouldn't exist.

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.080
So, two big problems.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.525
I'll come up to a third one.

00:25:48.525 --> 00:25:51.930
And this is one that's
probably motivated

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:55.350
a lot of theoretical physicists,
since Einstein, really,

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:56.850
in the '20s and '30s.

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:59.730
So this is a problem
to do with gravity.

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:02.640
Now gravity, as it
turns out, although it

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.500
feels quite strong--

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.250
it sticks us to the
floor, if you fall out

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:07.290
a window it hurts quite a lot--

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:08.460
it's actually terribly weak.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.470
It's a fantastically weak force.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:12.240
And this cartoon
illustrates that point.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.720
So we have the earth, which is
pretty large by any standard.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.500
And it's got a
gravitational attraction,

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.350
and it's pulling
on this paperclip.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:22.550
I can use a very weak fridge
magnet, which is only this big,

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:24.640
to pick up that paperclip.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.960
So that magnet is overcoming
the gravitational attraction

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:33.060
of this huge ball of rock
many, many, many times larger

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:34.380
in terms of mass.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.110
So that tells us, essentially,
that the electromagnetic force

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:39.230
is way, way, way
stronger than gravity.

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:40.980
If you had a magnet
the size of the Earth,

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.170
it would be
fantastically powerful.

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:44.290
You can compare these two.

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:45.840
So if we say that
electromagnetism

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.845
has a strength of one, then
gravity strength is this.

00:26:49.845 --> 00:26:51.240
[SPEAKER LAUGHS]

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:54.390
Ten to the minus
36, more or less.

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:56.340
I won't read that one out.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.440
And this, it's a
real puzzle, this.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.780
Why is there such
a huge hierarchy

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.060
between gravity and
the other forces?

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.280
So the strong, the weak,
and the electromagnetism

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.830
are all way, way, way
stronger than gravity.

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:10.400
And we don't understand
why that is, either.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.274
So there are lots of
problems, potentially.

00:27:12.274 --> 00:27:13.440
It's also very big problems.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.010
And that's what's a
large part the LHC was

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:19.730
built to try and solve.

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:22.070
Fortunately, though, there
are some possible theories

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:23.861
out there that could
explain some of these.

00:27:23.861 --> 00:27:27.860
And one of the most popular is
an idea called supersymmetry.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:30.830
Now supersymmetry,
the essential idea

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:34.380
is to invoke a new kind
of symmetry in nature.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.680
And it's a symmetry,
a rather odd symmetry.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.380
So it's not really like this
mirror image of antimatter,

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.020
but it's kind of comparable
to it, I suppose.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.480
So in supersymmetry,
there is a symmetry

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.740
between the matter particles.

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.140
So that's things
like the quarks,

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.190
and the electrons,
and the neutrinos.

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:52.040
And the force
particles which are

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.110
the gluons, the photons,
and the weak particles,

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:55.790
and the Higgs, as well.

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:58.580
And in supersymmetry,
every matter particle

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.950
gets a force particle partner.

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:04.160
And every force particle gets
a matter particle partner.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.440
So you end up with an
extra table of particles

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.840
that look like this.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.910
And they all have
really stupid names.

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:12.380
So basically, if
you want to know

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.088
what particle's name
is in supersymmetry,

00:28:14.088 --> 00:28:15.740
you add an S to the front of it.

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.770
So the electron
becomes the selectron.

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:22.985
The muon becomes the smuon.

00:28:22.985 --> 00:28:26.380
I think worst of all, possibly,
is the strange s quark.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.880
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:28:28.802 --> 00:28:30.760
Anyway, there should be
some kind of commission

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:31.390
to name things.

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:32.639
I don't know how this happens.

00:28:32.639 --> 00:28:33.800
They're called sparticles.

00:28:35.962 --> 00:28:37.920
It sounds very silly the
way I've described it.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.340
It's very clever, supersymmetry.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.465
I don't want to do it down.

00:28:43.009 --> 00:28:45.300
The interest in supersymmetry
really began in the '80s,

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.810
and it's been the most popular
extension of the Standard Model

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:50.184
for a very, very long time.

00:28:50.184 --> 00:28:51.600
And that's because
it's incredibly

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.520
good at solving some
of these problems

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.180
that I've described to you.

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:57.700
So, in particular, dark matter.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.760
So one of the reasons
that supersymmetry

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.560
is very popular with
particle physicists

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:05.730
is that often, the lightest
sparticle is stable.

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:08.130
And often, it's also
electrically neutral.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:11.070
And that's exactly what
you want for dark matter.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:13.200
So I said dark
matter is invisible.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.310
And that's because it doesn't
reflect, absorb, or emit light.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:21.330
And things that don't emit,
absorb, or reflect light

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:22.799
are electrically neutral.

00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:24.840
So you have an electrically
neutral particle that

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.490
doesn't interact with photons.

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:29.770
It could well make up the
dark matter in the universe.

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:32.760
So that's one reason for
liking supersymmetry.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.210
Another one.

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:35.880
There's a sort of
obsession in physics,

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.570
which is to try to unify
things, to simplify

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:42.210
complicated phenomena into
one sort of single underlying

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:42.924
phenomena.

00:29:42.924 --> 00:29:44.840
And that's true with the
forces, particularly.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.700
And unifying the different
forces in physics

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.910
has been a sort of ongoing
quest since Maxwell

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:53.430
unified electricity and
magnetism in his equations

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:55.240
back in the 19th century.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.940
So this is a rather confusing
graph, unfortunately.

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.770
I don't know why it's produced
this way, but it's upside down.

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:01.228
But basically what
you've got here,

00:30:01.228 --> 00:30:04.775
this axis is the strength of
the three different forces

00:30:04.775 --> 00:30:06.150
in the Standard
Model except they

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:08.760
get stronger as you go
down rather than going up.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.260
But don't worry
about that too much.

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.990
Now if you do
experiments and measure

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:15.390
the strength of these
forces, what you find,

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:17.850
rather curiously, is that
the strength of the forces

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:20.970
change as you go higher
and higher in energies.

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:23.220
So that basically means
if you have some collider

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.290
and you bash particles
into each other,

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:28.827
the harder you hit them into
each other, the forces--

00:30:28.827 --> 00:30:30.910
the strength of these
forces-- alter, essentially.

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:33.660
And what you see in the Standard
Model if you do experiments

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:35.490
at higher and higher energies--
and these are energies that are

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:38.190
way higher than we can actually
produce in an experiment,

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:40.680
but this is done with
theoretical calculations--

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.191
you find that at some very,
very high energy scale,

00:30:43.191 --> 00:30:44.940
there is a point where
these three lines--

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:47.010
the electromagnetic
force, the weak force,

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:48.180
and the strong force--

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:53.610
sort of come together
a bit, but not quite.

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:58.290
If you introduce supersymmetry,
these lines meet rather exactly

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:00.400
at a particular place,
labelled unification.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.420
And this suggests that with
supersymmetry, these three

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:07.770
forces are unified into
some single overlying

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:11.341
force which possibly
should be called the force.

00:31:11.341 --> 00:31:13.590
And so that's another reason
for liking supersymmetry.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:15.673
It unifies these three
apparently disparate forces

00:31:15.673 --> 00:31:17.440
into one.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.574
Actually, we've already
unified these two.

00:31:19.574 --> 00:31:21.240
That's partly what
the Higgs is involved

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.599
in, but never mind about that.

00:31:22.599 --> 00:31:23.640
It's just a strong force.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.049
The other reason to
like supersymmetry

00:31:26.049 --> 00:31:28.590
is that we've now doubled the
number of fundamental particles

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:29.130
to discover.

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:31.590
So people like me are kept
employed for a very long time.

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:32.730
So that's good.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:35.850
So we like supersymmetry.

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:37.290
Another possible theory.

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:40.115
So this one tries to explain
the weakness of gravity.

00:31:40.115 --> 00:31:42.240
So there are a number of
different versions of this

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.200
out there.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.670
Essentially, these
theories posit

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:47.700
an extra dimension of space--
or sometimes more than one

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.950
extra dimension of space--
as a way of explaining

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.460
the weakness of gravity.

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.600
Now, this is apparently
an image of what

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.540
extra dimensions look like.

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:57.480
OK.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.500
I'm not so sure.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.580
Yeah, apparently it is, anyway.

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.972
The idea is there is some
extra directions in which you

00:32:02.972 --> 00:32:05.430
can move than the up and down,
left and right, and forwards

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:06.013
and backwards.

00:32:06.013 --> 00:32:08.250
And the reason that we
don't observe them is either

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:10.020
because the particles
that we're made of

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:13.300
are stuck on our
three-dimensional sort of space

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.011
time, and only certain
things can travel

00:32:15.011 --> 00:32:16.260
through these high dimensions.

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.270
Or it's because these
extra dimensions are

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:20.190
squished up very tiny,
and therefore they're

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:21.960
impossible to observe.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.940
And the way you explain
the weakness of gravity

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.724
is usually by
gravity leaking away

00:32:25.724 --> 00:32:26.890
into these extra dimensions.

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:29.910
So gravity can move through
all of the dimensions of space

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:32.490
and therefore it's diluted,
whereas electromagnetism

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:34.920
is restricted to just live
inside these three dimensions

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.300
that we're familiar with.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.900
And if you want to know
the results of having

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.000
extra dimensional
theories like this,

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.370
this is what an extra
dimensional theory looks like,

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:46.340
according to the Daily Express.

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.020
So you make a
black hole at CERN,

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:52.260
and it swallows
the entire world.

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.840
We haven't seen that yet.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.900
Actually, this is what
they really look like.

00:32:57.900 --> 00:32:59.940
Basically in extra
dimensional theories,

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.560
often you can make
tiny black holes.

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.950
So this is where you
collide your particles

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:06.810
with enough energy
they actually collapse

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:09.540
a little region of
spacetime for a tiny moment

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.310
into a black hole.

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:14.094
And the reason we're not really
worried about these black holes

00:33:14.094 --> 00:33:16.260
eating the earth like in
that rather silly animation

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.631
is that according
to Hawking's theory,

00:33:18.631 --> 00:33:20.880
these black holes should
almost immediately evaporate.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.410
So as soon as they're
created, they just go poof.

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:26.190
And this is a simulation
of one of these black holes

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:27.030
disintegrating.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:28.677
So the black hole
was here, and it's

00:33:28.677 --> 00:33:30.510
turned into a whole
load of other particles.

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:32.912
And they give a very
characteristic signature

00:33:32.912 --> 00:33:35.370
in your detector if you manage
to make one of these things.

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:37.411
And it's not the whole
world falling into a hole.

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:42.690
Finding the Higgs
was one objective,

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:44.887
but finding all these
things was a really big part

00:33:44.887 --> 00:33:46.720
of the reason the LHC
was built. And I'm now

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.220
going to take you on a
brief tour of this really

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.265
extraordinary machine.

00:33:50.265 --> 00:33:51.390
So this is a map of Europe.

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:53.070
We're going to zoom
in on Switzerland.

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:54.900
This is Lake Geneva.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.090
Geneva is just down here,
and CERN's about there.

00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:59.970
If we go in a bit closer,
this is an aerial shot

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:01.740
from a plane of the Geneva area.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.680
So again, you can
see Lake Geneva.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.090
The city of Geneva is
this kind of grey smudge.

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:09.030
This long thing here
is the airport runway.

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:10.230
CERN's over there.

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:12.330
And then marked in
yellow on the countryside

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:15.420
is the route of the
Large Hadron Collider.

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.670
So this is the largest
scientific instrument

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:20.219
ever built by the human race.

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:22.800
By some measures, it's the
largest machine ever built.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.510
It's 27 kilometres
in circumference.

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:28.509
It crosses the
Swiss-French border twice.

00:34:28.509 --> 00:34:30.300
This yellow line is
not there in real life.

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.116
It's about a hundred
metres under the ground.

00:34:33.116 --> 00:34:34.949
The main reason it's
underground is actually

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:38.679
not because it's dangerous and
somehow emits lots of radiation

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:40.179
that you'd need to
be shielded from.

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:43.170
It's because it would be very
expensive to buy 27 kilometres

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:45.670
of land to build it on.

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:47.270
So it's just below the surface.

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:49.860
And the way it works is really
quite simple and rather brutal.

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.870
Over here at CERN,
there is a bottle

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:54.300
of hydrogen gas about
this large, which

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:58.530
is plugged into a 30 metre
long particle accelerator.

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:00.490
And that hydrogen is
taken out of its canister.

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:02.620
It's zapped with
an electric field.

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:04.120
The hydrogen atoms
are ripped apart.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.240
The electrons are ripped
off the hydrogen atoms.

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.370
And you're left with
protons, which are just

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:10.450
the nuclei of hydrogen atoms.

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:12.225
And those are sent
down at an accelerator.

00:35:12.225 --> 00:35:14.850
And then they're sent through a
series of accelerators at CERN.

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:16.384
So imagine kind
of whizzing around

00:35:16.384 --> 00:35:17.550
a number of different loops.

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:20.260
Eventually, it goes into this
ring called the Super Proton

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.910
Synchrotron, which
back in the '80s

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:25.530
was the largest particle
accelerator in the world.

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:27.840
But now it's just a
feeder for the much bigger

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.640
Large Hadron Collider.

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.700
So you have a beam of protons,
one going this way, one

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:33.890
going the other way.

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:36.450
And then at four
points around the ring,

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:38.400
these protons are
brought into collision

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.160
inside gigantic,
three-dimensional digital

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:43.740
cameras that take
photographs, essentially,

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.270
of these collisions,
and try to see

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:48.240
if we've created new particles.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.740
So if you go underground,
this is what you see.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:55.157
Very, very, very long blue tube,
curving away into the distance.

00:35:55.157 --> 00:35:56.740
They're about eight
access shafts that

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:58.000
take you down to the tunnel.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.791
People actually use
bicycles to get around,

00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:01.960
because the distances
are so large.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.990
So this blue tube is essentially
the world's largest thermos

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:06.550
flask.

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:12.130
Inside it, there is a bath
of liquid helium at minus 271

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:14.441
degrees Celsius.

00:36:14.441 --> 00:36:16.690
Bit less than two degrees
at absolute zero, the lowest

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:17.925
possible temperature.

00:36:17.925 --> 00:36:20.050
And the reason it's very
cold is because of the way

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:22.930
that these particles are
steered around the ring

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:25.260
are using incredibly
powerful magnets.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.010
And these magnets
are superconducting,

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:29.560
which means they have no
electrical resistance.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.570
And that means you can
create extremely strong

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:33.160
magnetic fields,
but they only work

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.060
at very, very low temperatures.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.910
So the whole machine
is cooled down

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:38.650
with liquid helium
pumped intravenously

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:42.439
through this entire ring to
make the magnets operate.

00:36:42.439 --> 00:36:44.230
The engineering challenges
in building this

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.650
are absolutely extraordinary.

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:48.100
To give you one fact
that I found amazing

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.722
when I learned it, is that--

00:36:50.722 --> 00:36:52.180
maybe you remember
it from school--

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:54.362
if you get a piece of
metal and you cool it down,

00:36:54.362 --> 00:36:55.570
it gets a little bit smaller.

00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:58.180
It contracts slightly.

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:01.150
So you're cooling down a 27
kilometre long basically piece

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:04.379
of metal by 271 degrees.

00:37:04.379 --> 00:37:06.670
And what happens when you do
that is the entire machine

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:10.240
shrinks by 30 metres in length.

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:15.430
So this thing which has to be
aligned to kind of micron level

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:19.450
has to be able to contract by
30 metres without breaking,

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:21.740
and without misaligning,
and without going wrong.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.220
And the fact that it
works is really amazing.

00:37:26.406 --> 00:37:28.156
These are the other
parts of the machines.

00:37:28.156 --> 00:37:29.690
You have the very,
very long blue tube.

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:31.370
And then at four
places around the ring,

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:34.632
this tunnel opens out into these
huge subterranean caverns that

00:37:34.632 --> 00:37:36.230
are sort of cathedral-sized.

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:39.320
And inside these caverns are
extraordinary looking machines

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.880
like this.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.790
This is the Compact
Muon Solenoid,

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:45.680
which is a strange use
of the word compact.

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.890
So this thing is 15 metres high.

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:52.340
So there's a guy in a hard
hat for scale, just there.

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:54.230
It's 25 metres long.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:56.090
It weighs 12,000 tonnes.

00:37:56.090 --> 00:38:00.040
It contains enough iron
to make two Eiffel Towers.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:04.090
Essentially what this thing is,
is an incredibly sophisticated,

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:06.740
gigantic, 3D digital camera.

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:09.910
So what happens is, the protons
come in through this beam pipe,

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:11.410
and in one from the
other direction.

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:12.868
This thing is
barrel-shaped, so you

00:38:12.868 --> 00:38:14.770
imagine it goes off
the edge of the image.

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:16.112
They collide in the centre.

00:38:16.112 --> 00:38:18.070
You get a whole load of
stuff going everywhere.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:21.910
And this detector
records those collisions

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:26.820
in real time, actually 40
million times every second.

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:28.342
This is another one of these.

00:38:28.342 --> 00:38:29.550
There's four of these things.

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:30.674
This is the biggest of all.

00:38:30.674 --> 00:38:34.230
This is ATLAS, which
is kind of a rather

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:35.406
good, cool-sounding name.

00:38:35.406 --> 00:38:36.780
It's a bit of a
tortured acronym,

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:39.130
so I won't try and tell you
what it actually stands for.

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:41.400
But essentially, ATLAS
is even bigger than CMS.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.640
This thing is 25 metres
high, 40 metres long.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:45.810
It's absolutely huge.

00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:48.150
If you ever get a chance
to go to CERN and get down

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:49.210
underground to
see these things--

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:50.876
which I think is quite
difficult, sadly,

00:38:50.876 --> 00:38:53.154
these days because
it's quite busy there--

00:38:53.154 --> 00:38:54.820
I mean, when I saw
them a few years ago,

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.410
they really are the most
amazing things you'll ever see.

00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:57.990
They're absolutely unbelievable.

00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:00.340
So ATLAS does, essentially,
a very similar job to CMS.

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:03.182
They're two different
experiments.

00:39:03.182 --> 00:39:04.890
They work on similar
principles, but have

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:07.320
completely independent teams,
and independent technologies.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.945
And they're really
there to cross-check

00:39:08.945 --> 00:39:10.710
each other's results.

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:12.870
So this is a
representative image

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:15.330
of what happens when
two particles collide.

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:16.865
Really, it's actually
a real image.

00:39:16.865 --> 00:39:18.406
This has got the
date on it, I think.

00:39:18.406 --> 00:39:22.900
So it says 2011, June 25th,
at 6:30 in the morning.

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:25.787
This is two protons meeting.

00:39:25.787 --> 00:39:27.870
The reason we're doing
these collision experiments

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:32.940
is, what we're actually
doing is making matter.

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.580
You quite often hear particle
accelerators or colliders

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:37.042
described as atom smashers.

00:39:37.042 --> 00:39:39.000
And that sort of suggests
that what we're doing

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.502
is breaking atoms apart in
order to see what's inside them.

00:39:42.502 --> 00:39:44.460
But that's not really
what we're interested in.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.230
People have known
what's inside atoms

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:47.670
for quite a long time now.

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:50.140
What particle
colliders actually are

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.410
are ways of making matter
that doesn't normally

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:54.070
exist in the universe.

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:57.057
So you load a huge amount
of energy onto each protons.

00:39:57.057 --> 00:39:58.140
They're given huge speeds.

00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:02.640
They're going at 99.9999991
percent of the speed of light

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:03.930
when they collide.

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:07.890
At this point, they're
carrying 7,000 times their rest

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:09.707
mass energy as kinetic energy.

00:40:09.707 --> 00:40:11.790
So that means you can make
something, essentially,

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:16.230
that is 14,000 times heavier
than a proton in the collision.

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:17.430
They come together.

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:19.440
Their kinetic energy is
converted into matter,

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.690
and that's what you're seeing.

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:23.040
So you're seeing hundreds
of particles being created.

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:23.910
And these are not
things that are

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:25.402
coming from inside the proton.

00:40:25.402 --> 00:40:26.610
Well, in some cases they are.

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:29.010
But a lot of it is stuff
that's being made, essentially,

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:32.110
out of this kinetic energy.

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:34.360
This process of collisions
happens 40 million times

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:37.520
every second inside all
four of these experiments.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.970
And they run for
most of the year.

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:41.440
So usually from about April,
March, through to just

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:42.820
before Christmas.

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:45.560
So 24 hours a day with
occasional technical stops.

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.920
So you can get a sense of
how many of these collisions

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:48.310
it produces.

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:50.184
It's absolutely vast,
and the data challenges

00:40:50.184 --> 00:40:52.120
of coping with this
rate of collisions

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.160
is really extraordinary as well.

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:58.030
So I'm going to try and
briefly now explain to you

00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:00.720
what that bump was in that graph
I showed you at the beginning.

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.890
So how do you find
a Higgs boson?

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:05.260
Well, two protons collide.

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:08.260
And if you're
extremely lucky, they

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:10.660
will create a Higgs particle.

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:13.760
Now, the Higgs particle only
lives for a tiny fraction

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:14.260
of a second.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.720
I think it's something like
10 to the minus 24 seconds.

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.050
So way, way, way too
short to be detected.

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:22.570
The Higgs doesn't ever
reach the detector.

00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:25.570
It's created and it
disintegrates instantly.

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:28.390
Now, one of the
ways it can decay

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:30.210
is into two particles of light.

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:32.050
So you get two
high-energy photons--

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:34.540
two gamma rays-- that fly
out from the collision

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:36.490
point that came from
this Higgs decay.

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:38.290
And this is what
this event shows.

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:40.840
This is from ATLAS,
again from 2011.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:46.930
So you can see these two big
bars here are two photons.

00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:49.780
So what an analyst does--
a physicist-- will say,

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:51.110
OK, I'm looking for the Higgs.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:53.440
So go through all these
trillions and trillions

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.230
of collisions, and find
me all the collisions

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:58.750
where there were two
high-energy photons produced.

00:41:58.750 --> 00:42:01.317
Because they might have
come from a Higgs boson.

00:42:01.317 --> 00:42:03.400
And then you take the
energy of those two photons.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.160
You add them together, and
you work out what was the mass

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:08.090
of the object which
they came from,

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:10.423
which was created right at
the centre of this collision.

00:42:10.423 --> 00:42:13.414
So you're kind of reconstructing
what the Higgs sort of decayed

00:42:13.414 --> 00:42:14.830
into from the bits
that you end up

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:16.038
flying through your detector.

00:42:16.038 --> 00:42:17.976
It's a bit like kind
of blowing up a car,

00:42:17.976 --> 00:42:19.600
and trying to work
out what kind of car

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.530
it was from the bits of
shrapnel that go flying past,

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:23.365
essentially.

00:42:23.365 --> 00:42:27.250
And what you then do is you
take all these pairs of photons.

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:28.364
You calculate the energy--

00:42:28.364 --> 00:42:30.280
the total energy-- and
you plot it on a graph.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.050
And that's all this is.

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:36.570
On the vertical axis, you've got
the number of pairs of photons.

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:37.990
And on the horizontal
axis, you've

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:42.640
got the total mass of the object
they would have come from.

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:46.480
Now, most of the time
when you see two photons,

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.771
they didn't come from a Higgs.

00:42:47.771 --> 00:42:49.020
They came from something else.

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.769
So there's lots of
ways of making photons.

00:42:50.769 --> 00:42:53.350
If you bang protons together
very hard, you get lights.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:54.520
That's what happens.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.520
So most of the time, it's just
background noise, essentially.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.020
And the reason the
bump is important

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:01.150
is at a certain mass--

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:05.320
which is 125 times, more or
less, the mass of the proton--

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.360
you can see this little excess.

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.792
And that's because every
time you make a Higgs,

00:43:09.792 --> 00:43:11.000
the Higgs is always the same.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.280
A Higgs always
has the same mass.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.988
So the photons from
the Higgs will always

00:43:13.988 --> 00:43:15.460
add up to the same mass.

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:18.576
So you get a little excess
at that particular value.

00:43:18.576 --> 00:43:20.950
So this bump is the sign that
this thing is really there.

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:23.440
And the thing that really
convinced everyone on that day

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.960
back in July 2012 was
that both experiments--

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:29.549
ATLAS and CMS-- both saw
a bump in the same place.

00:43:29.549 --> 00:43:31.090
And that was where
everyone stood up,

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:34.540
and everyone really got
excited and started cheering.

00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:35.330
So that's great.

00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:39.050
So the LHC switched
on for the first time

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:41.450
successfully without
blowing itself up in 2009.

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:46.040
It ran for about 2 and 1/2 years
until the Higgs was-- the Higgs

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:49.620
announcement came in July 2012.

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:52.410
And everyone was very,
very happy that day.

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:55.070
But then since
then, there's been

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:56.540
a kind of a string of bad news.

00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:59.060
This is a story from
2011-- actually,

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.710
even before the
Higgs was found--

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:03.597
saying certain results were sort
of really causing some problems

00:44:03.597 --> 00:44:05.930
for some of the other theories
that we were looking for,

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:07.910
particularly supersymmetry.

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:10.697
So there were some ideas
when the LHC was first

00:44:10.697 --> 00:44:13.280
switched on that there'd be so
many supersymmetric particles--

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.080
so many sparticles-- we wouldn't
be able to handle them at all.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.440
We wouldn't be able to read
out the data quickly enough.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:19.940
Actually what
happened is, there's

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:21.920
not been a sign of
these things at all.

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.270
So there's one from 2011.

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:25.310
This is another one from 2015.

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:28.641
"LHC Keeps Bruising 'Difficult
to Kill' Supersymmetry."

00:44:28.641 --> 00:44:30.890
"Popular physics theory
running out of hiding places."

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:32.000
So you get the idea.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.470
And this has really,
honestly, been

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:38.870
the story, actually, of the last
4 and 1/2 years, 5 years now.

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:40.572
Since the Higgs was
discovered, there's

00:44:40.572 --> 00:44:42.530
been lots of very important
physics being done,

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:43.321
don't get me wrong.

00:44:43.321 --> 00:44:44.840
So, for example,
one of the things

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:46.670
ATLAS and CMS have
been doing is studying

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:49.370
the Higgs to truly
try and pin down,

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:51.890
is this thing really
the Standard Model Higgs

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:53.810
boson that Peter Higgs
said should be there?

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:57.350
Or is it some other, more
exotic type of a thing?

00:44:57.350 --> 00:44:59.937
Maybe it's a supersymmetric
Higgs boson, for example.

00:44:59.937 --> 00:45:01.520
But all those
measurements seem to say

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:04.280
it actually looks very, very
like the Standard Model Higgs

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:04.860
boson.

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:06.860
And all these other
theories-- extra dimensions,

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:10.230
supersymmetry-- so far, there
hasn't been any sign of them.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:12.000
And people, I
think, have honestly

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.360
been getting a little
bit anxious about this.

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:20.530
There was a big moment of
excitement back in 2016.

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:21.910
This was the summer of 2016.

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:23.860
A new bump turned up.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:26.080
I told you physicists
like bumps.

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:29.170
So this is a very similar plot
to the one I just showed you.

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:32.210
It's, again, adding up pairs
of photons from inside--

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:34.780
in this case, inside
the ATLAS experiment.

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.000
And what they saw,
again, was something that

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.740
maybe looked a bit like a bump.

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:40.840
And it was at much
higher mass this time.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:45.460
So the Higgs mass was about
125 protons, more or less.

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:48.580
This thing was
about 750 protons.

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:50.440
So it was much, much heavier.

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.690
And this created a huge
amount of excitement

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:55.681
at the time, possibly a
little bit prematurely.

00:45:55.681 --> 00:45:57.680
So the thing you have to
be very careful about--

00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.310
and experimentalists and,
generally, physicists

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:00.910
as a whole are
very cautious when

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:02.701
they see something like
this, because there

00:46:02.701 --> 00:46:05.290
is a certain chance
that this kind of bump

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:07.270
could just be a fluctuation.

00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:09.280
It's just sometimes
just by random chance,

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.980
you might happen to get a
few more pairs of photons

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.430
produced at that mass.

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:15.070
And it's a bit like
rolling a dice,

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:17.770
and occasionally you might
roll 10 6's in a row.

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:20.590
Even if that's very improbable,
if you do enough experiments,

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:23.379
you'll get that kind of
result once in a while.

00:46:23.379 --> 00:46:25.420
So maybe this was just a
statistical fluctuation,

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:27.310
but people did get very excited.

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:30.910
This is a graph that shows
the excitement of physicists.

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:33.700
So this result was
announced around the 15th

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:35.690
of December, 2015.

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:37.190
And this is the
number of papers put

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:40.420
on the archive over
the next 10 days.

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.280
So you can see just
by Christmas Eve,

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:44.050
there were almost 100 papers--

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:45.730
theoretical papers--
trying to explain

00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:48.670
what this little
wobble in a graph was.

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:50.720
So there was a huge
amount of excitement.

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:53.140
And, you know,
maybe not justified.

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:55.590
As it turned out, it wasn't
justified, unfortunately.

00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:58.180
So when ATLAS produced
the results again

00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:01.150
with more data, what they
found was this little wiggle

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:02.320
had disappeared.

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:04.204
And, essentially, it
was that it seems--

00:47:04.204 --> 00:47:05.120
no one made a mistake.

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.750
It wasn't that the
experiment had got it wrong

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:10.222
Just sometimes by
luck or bad luck,

00:47:10.222 --> 00:47:12.430
sometimes you get a little
fluctuation in your graph.

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:14.320
And it makes you think,
briefly, that you've

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:15.361
discovered something new.

00:47:15.361 --> 00:47:17.740
But actually, you
haven't, sadly.

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:19.720
But I said there was
sort of something

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:21.230
interesting happening.

00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:23.800
And there's actually
a series of results

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.020
that have come out of the
experiment that I work on.

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:27.970
Now I can't claim to
have been instrumental

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:29.740
in these measurements
myself, but it's

00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:32.530
been very exciting being kind
of an observer in all of this.

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:35.710
So my experiment is called the
Large Hadron Collider beauty

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:36.540
experiment, LHCb.

00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:41.680
Well, beauty stands
for a particular type

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:44.980
of particle, the b quark, which
is actually usually referred

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:46.319
to as the bottom quark.

00:47:46.319 --> 00:47:48.360
But we would rather be
known as beauty physicists

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.330
than bottom physicists.

00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:51.760
So it's the LHC
beauty experiment.

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.305
It's not as pretty
as ATLAS and CMS.

00:47:53.305 --> 00:47:55.180
It does look a bit like
a multicoloured toast

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:55.930
rack or something.

00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:58.420
But it's a very, very
clever experiment.

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:03.070
What LHCb does is really rather
different to the other two

00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:05.140
big guys, ATLAS and CMS.

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.840
So broadly speaking,
what ATLAS and CMS do

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:10.990
are what we call direct
searches for new physics.

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:14.770
By which I mean, they want
to bang protons together.

00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:16.600
So here's your one
proton, another proton.

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:17.877
They're given lots of energy.

00:48:17.877 --> 00:48:19.210
They're smashed into each other.

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:21.940
And then you make some
new, much heavier particle,

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:24.970
and you observe it, like
the Higgs, for example.

00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:29.410
And this kind of direct process,
the mass of the thing that you

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:31.930
can make is limited
by how much energy

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:34.100
you can put into the collision.

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:37.790
So if you know Einstein's
equation, E equals mc squared.

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:40.330
So that tells us that
energy and matter are

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:42.470
essentially interchangeable.

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:44.950
So if you have E energy
here and E energy here,

00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:46.450
then the amount of
mass you can make

00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:48.630
is 2E divided by the
speed of light, squared.

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:50.500
So that tells you how
heavy the thing is

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.360
that you can possibly create.

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:53.904
And that's one way
of doing physics.

00:48:53.904 --> 00:48:55.570
And that's how the
Higgs was discovered.

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:57.194
And that's how a lot
of the dark matter

00:48:57.194 --> 00:49:00.140
searches or supersymmetry
searches work as well.

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:02.600
What LHCb does is
a bit different.

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:06.070
It does measurements which are,
broadly speaking, indirect.

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:07.730
Now, as a sort of
a silly analogy,

00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:09.520
have you all heard the
joke, how would you

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:12.849
know an elephant's
been in your fridge?

00:49:12.849 --> 00:49:13.890
Footprints in the butter.

00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:14.970
Yeah, exactly.

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:17.460
So if you'd like, ATLAS and
CMS are hunting elephants.

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:19.150
They're going out into
the jungle with a shotgun,

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:20.550
and trying to find an elephant.

00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:22.070
Don't do that.

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:24.150
And what LHCb are
doing, actually,

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:27.210
is trying to find footprints
left by elephants.

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:31.097
So in a way, they're kind
of complementary in a sense.

00:49:31.097 --> 00:49:33.180
If there aren't very many
elephants in the jungle,

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:35.400
running across one
might be quite rare.

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.376
But if it leaves footprints
all over the place,

00:49:37.376 --> 00:49:39.750
you might be able to infer
there's an elephant out there,

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:41.445
although you may not know
exactly what type of elephant

00:49:41.445 --> 00:49:43.320
it is from just looking
at its footprints.

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.930
So that's the sort of an
analogy for what we're doing.

00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:48.540
In terms of the actual
physics, the b, as I said,

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:51.510
stands for b quark, or bottom
quark, or beauty quark.

00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:54.360
So what we tend to
study are the ways

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.400
that the b quark can decay.

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.380
So, for example, you
have this green blob

00:49:58.380 --> 00:49:59.920
represents a b quark.

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:03.240
And let's say it can decay into
some other set of particles,

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:06.330
some three other particles
that it will disintegrate into.

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:09.360
Now in the Standard
Model, any decay process

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:11.580
where one particle turns
into a bunch of particles

00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:14.640
usually happens
via the weak force.

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.260
So this is the
force that mediates

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:17.690
these kind of decay processes.

00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:20.730
So essentially, this particle
goes via the weak force

00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:22.710
into these three particles.

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:24.690
And just like you
could use the Standard

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:27.714
Model to predict very accurately
the property of the electron--

00:50:27.714 --> 00:50:29.130
I showed you that
very long number

00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:31.800
at the beginning-- you can
also use it to work out

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:35.700
how often should a b quark
turn into these particular sets

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:36.300
of particles.

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:37.925
And you can calculate
that number often

00:50:37.925 --> 00:50:40.180
to quite a high
level of accuracy.

00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:44.730
Now if there exists
some other force field--

00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:46.080
let's say there's a fifth force.

00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:47.121
Let's just make it there.

00:50:47.121 --> 00:50:49.710
Could be supersymmetry, it
could be something else.

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:52.140
If that force exists,
it can very subtly

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:54.600
influence the way
these particles decay.

00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:58.590
It effectively provides another
route from the initial state

00:50:58.590 --> 00:50:59.650
into the final state.

00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:03.420
So the Standard Model
might be the strongest way

00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:06.687
of getting from your b quark
into your set of particles

00:51:06.687 --> 00:51:07.770
that you're decaying into.

00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:10.380
But your new physics
can also provide a root.

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:12.180
And that essentially
will slightly

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:14.370
enhance the decay rate.

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:16.140
The kind of game
we generally play

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:18.450
is, we measure these
sorts of decay rates--

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:21.760
how often does a b quark turn
into some set of particles--

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:24.660
and we compare that number with
what the Standard Model tells

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:26.700
us it ought to be.

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:28.170
And if that number
disagrees, that

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:31.539
can be an indirect hint
that some other matter,

00:51:31.539 --> 00:51:33.330
some other particle,
some other force field

00:51:33.330 --> 00:51:37.130
is coming in, and
helping that decay along.

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:38.160
It's precision physics.

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:40.050
Rather than going out, and
banging things into each other,

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:42.341
and looking for some big
particle that you're creating,

00:51:42.341 --> 00:51:43.977
you're studying
much more abundant--

00:51:43.977 --> 00:51:45.560
these are still
created in collisions.

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:47.610
I mean, we're still banging
things into each other.

00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:49.026
But the thing with
the b quark is,

00:51:49.026 --> 00:51:51.330
you make billions, and
billions, and billions of them.

00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:53.630
So you can make very,
very precise measurements.

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:56.640
And you can detect, potentially,
these very subtle effects

00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:00.930
caused by new forces that
lie beyond the energy

00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:02.969
that the collider
can reach, actually.

00:52:02.969 --> 00:52:05.010
So that's the advantage
of indirect measurements.

00:52:05.010 --> 00:52:08.410
And it's complementary
to what ATLAS and CMS do.

00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:11.200
Now, the thing that's
been really interesting

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:14.220
in the last couple of years
are tests of something

00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:18.220
that sounds a bit arcane
called lepton universality.

00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:20.350
And this is
essentially a property

00:52:20.350 --> 00:52:25.030
of the Standard Model,
which is the leptons which

00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:28.480
are the electron, the muon,
and the tau, these three

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:29.990
negatively charged particles.

00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:31.180
So they're each
heavier than the other.

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:33.400
The electron's the one we found
more than a hundred years ago.

00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:34.858
It has a heavier
version, the muon,

00:52:34.858 --> 00:52:37.360
and an even heavier
version called the tau.

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:41.230
And in the Standard Model,
all three of these particles

00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:43.360
are treated identically.

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.730
So that means that all
the forces interacts

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:47.640
with these three
particles pretty much

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:49.850
in exactly the same way.

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:52.330
And that means if you
compare two processes that,

00:52:52.330 --> 00:52:55.630
say, involve
electrons and muons,

00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:59.500
they should have exactly
the same rate, more or less.

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:02.400
And what we've been looking
at at LHCb is this process.

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:05.170
So you have your b
quark, your beauty quark,

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:10.480
and it decays via the weak force
into a strange quark and two

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.062
electrons.

00:53:12.062 --> 00:53:12.895
So that's the decay.

00:53:12.895 --> 00:53:14.590
It's from one
particle into three.

00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:16.340
And the two electrons
are the crucial bit.

00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:18.610
They are things to
pay attention to.

00:53:18.610 --> 00:53:21.636
Now a test of this idea, a
test of lepton universality--

00:53:21.636 --> 00:53:24.010
the fact the Standard Model
treats all of these different

00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:25.840
versions of the
electron the same--

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:28.300
that tells us that if we
look at a corresponding decay

00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:31.840
where the b quark turns into a
strange quark and two muons--

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:34.570
which are the heavier versions
of the electron-- then

00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:36.850
the rate of this should
be exactly the same

00:53:36.850 --> 00:53:39.890
as the rates of this.

00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:43.490
And when people started to
think about this measurement,

00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:45.380
there wasn't any
really very good reason

00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:48.500
to think that it was going to
produce anything interesting.

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:49.645
It was good to test it.

00:53:49.645 --> 00:53:51.020
The lepton
universality is a sort

00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:52.710
of principle of
the Standard Model.

00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:55.600
So it's good to test these
things, just to make sure.

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:57.069
And what they found was--

00:53:57.069 --> 00:53:58.610
this is what the
Standard Model says.

00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:01.580
If you take the
number of muon decays

00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:04.370
and divide it by the
number of electron decays,

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:05.250
they should be equal.

00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:07.833
So what the Standard Model says
is, this number, more or less,

00:54:07.833 --> 00:54:11.240
should be 1 to quite a
high level of precision.

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:16.550
In 2014, LHCb produced a paper,
and this is what they measured.

00:54:16.550 --> 00:54:19.910
So that's even balance
between muons and electrons.

00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:24.060
They measured 0.75
plus or minus 0.1.

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:26.640
So it seems that
there were fewer muon

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:29.800
decays than electron decays.

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:33.980
Now, this isn't yet anything
to get terribly excited about.

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:36.860
So if you look at the
uncertainty-- it's 0.1--

00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:41.950
this number is only
0.25 away from 1.

00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:44.730
So that means you only
need to kind of-- you know,

00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:46.305
I talk about these
fluctuations that

00:54:46.305 --> 00:54:48.430
can fool you into thinking
you found something new.

00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:50.844
It wouldn't take a very
big fluctuation just

00:54:50.844 --> 00:54:52.510
to send your number
down a bit, and make

00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:55.700
it look like you've seen
something new and interesting.

00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:57.730
So there was definite
interest in this.

00:54:57.730 --> 00:55:01.060
It's what we call a sort
of 2 sigma effect, which

00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:04.607
means it's about two errors away
from what you expect it to be.

00:55:04.607 --> 00:55:06.190
And there were lots
of papers produced

00:55:06.190 --> 00:55:08.800
in 2014 as a result of this.

00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:11.500
Then just this
year, the experiment

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:13.370
produced a equivalent
measurement.

00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:16.030
So it's with a
slightly different set

00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:18.580
of particles, but basically
the same basic thing.

00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:20.750
So comparing muons
and electrons.

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:22.496
And this is what they measured.

00:55:22.496 --> 00:55:26.200
So they measured 0.68
plus or minus 0.08.

00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:29.290
So this is a little bit
further away from one.

00:55:29.290 --> 00:55:31.892
It's very close, as well, to
what was measured in 2014.

00:55:31.892 --> 00:55:33.850
These are two independent
measurements, though,

00:55:33.850 --> 00:55:35.400
so they're not
using the same data.

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:37.610
They're using
different sets of data.

00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:41.380
The fact that they line up
like this is quite intriguing.

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:44.830
And it's caused some really
quite serious interest.

00:55:44.830 --> 00:55:48.880
So these measurements are,
at the moment, the biggest

00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:51.340
deviations from
the Standard Model

00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:54.320
anywhere in any experiment
that we're aware of.

00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.140
And it's not just these.

00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:58.000
There are a few other
measurements as well,

00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.920
of similar sorts of
processes that all

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:03.130
show slight discrepancies
with the Standard Model.

00:56:03.130 --> 00:56:05.680
Nothing independently
yet to really be sure

00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:06.880
that it's something new.

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:10.150
But they all seem to be
lining up in a consistent way.

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:12.820
And people are still
rightly being very cautious.

00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:15.340
Because it could be when
these measurements are

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:18.130
updated in a year or two,
that it goes back to 1.

00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:20.680
That it was just some
statistical fluke.

00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:22.000
Or maybe we made a mistake.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.741
Maybe we've missed
some systematic effect

00:56:23.741 --> 00:56:24.490
in the experiment.

00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:26.906
Hopefully that's not the case,
but that's always possible.

00:56:26.906 --> 00:56:30.820
So it could be that these
things will disappear.

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:32.950
But the other
possibility is, it's not

00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:34.670
a statistical fluctuation.

00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:35.567
We haven't messed up.

00:56:35.567 --> 00:56:37.150
This is actually the
sign of something

00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:38.761
really fundamentally new.

00:56:38.761 --> 00:56:41.260
And what's interesting is, it's
something that no one really

00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:42.190
expected, either.

00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:45.490
It's not supersymmetry, and
it's not large extra dimensions.

00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:47.350
It's something else.

00:56:47.350 --> 00:56:49.720
And that, in a way, would
be even more exciting,

00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:52.330
because finding something
that you really didn't expect

00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:55.260
is quite often when the
biggest breakthroughs happen.

00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:58.636
So what could this be?

00:56:58.636 --> 00:56:59.760
There are lots, as I said--

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:00.780
I showed you that
graph with a hundred

00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:02.400
papers for that previous bump.

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:04.470
There are something
like 450 papers

00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:07.820
now out there citing these
two results from LHCb,

00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:10.430
and a number of other
results as well.

00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:12.240
I'll mention just
one, and that's

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.550
partly because it's
a theory that some

00:57:14.550 --> 00:57:16.650
of my colleagues at the
Cavendish Laboratory

00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:17.910
have been talking about.

00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:19.170
Again, very cautiously.

00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:21.960
So what their line is,
it's extremely unlikely

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.700
that this is a real effect.

00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:26.100
Because the Standard
Model works so well,

00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:28.410
if we're going to say that
it's broken in some way,

00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:30.480
that requires really
extraordinary evidence.

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:34.230
But if this is real, then it
could be telling us something

00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:35.382
really, really fundamental.

00:57:35.382 --> 00:57:36.840
And it's a question
that, in a way,

00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:38.970
that's been slightly ignored.

00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:40.884
And it's back to
this picture again,

00:57:40.884 --> 00:57:42.300
this picture of
the Standard Model

00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:43.590
that we had at the beginning.

00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:47.060
So I said that there are these
three generations, the quark,

00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:49.320
and the up quark and down
quark, and the electron.

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:51.300
And then this charm, and the
strange quark, and the muon.

00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:52.680
The top and the bottom
quark, and the tau.

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:55.410
And I said, we don't know why
there are three generations.

00:57:55.410 --> 00:57:57.330
We don't know why there
are these particles.

00:57:57.330 --> 00:58:00.930
Well, one of the
possible explanations

00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:05.760
of this discrepancy could
explain this structure.

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:08.430
So what we might be
on the edge of finding

00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:10.410
is some extension of
the Standard Model

00:58:10.410 --> 00:58:13.420
that will a bit like the
discovery of the electron

00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:17.820
in the 19th century explain
this peculiar periodic table

00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:21.330
of particles that we currently
have at a deeper level.

00:58:21.330 --> 00:58:24.960
It essentially involves
invoking an additional force,

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:28.412
a new, very strong
force at high energy.

00:58:28.412 --> 00:58:30.870
And it would also imply some
other very interesting things.

00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:33.750
Apart from possibly being a
clue to explain this problem,

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:36.900
it would also tell us
that the Higgs is not

00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:38.430
an elementary particle at all.

00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:39.610
It's not fundamental.

00:58:39.610 --> 00:58:43.080
It's actually made of other
things, other strongly

00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:45.240
interacting exotic particles.

00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:47.670
So it would really
change, fundamentally,

00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:50.216
our understanding of
the Standard Model.

00:58:50.216 --> 00:58:52.840
And it would be very exciting if
this does turn out to be real.

00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:55.430
Now, people in my experiment
are working very hard.

00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:57.930
Everyone's trying to get into
this area, as you can imagine,

00:58:57.930 --> 00:58:58.470
including me.

00:58:58.470 --> 00:59:00.110
So I'm starting to sort of
do measurements like this,

00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:01.900
or trying to do
measurements like this.

00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:03.750
There will be updates
to these papers

00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:05.980
quite soon, so probably
within the next year.

00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:07.750
Certainly within
the next year or so.

00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:11.220
So the answer to
this question should

00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:12.930
be coming in very short order.

00:59:12.930 --> 00:59:15.062
So either we're going
to confirm this effect

00:59:15.062 --> 00:59:16.770
or it's going to
disappear, and we're all

00:59:16.770 --> 00:59:18.270
going to get very depressed.

00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:20.380
But hopefully it's the
first and not the second.

00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:23.160
But it is a very exciting time
to be in particle physics.

00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.900
So definitely keep
your eyes peeled

00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:27.210
over the next year or
two, because we should

00:59:27.210 --> 00:59:29.220
get an answer either way.

00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:30.120
Thanks very much.

00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:32.570
