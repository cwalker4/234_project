00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.340
On the subject of totalitarianism, um

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.900
I wanted to do something very quickly, so

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.000
I'm guessing that even though most people in the room have negative views of both men

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.980
They have a more intensely negative view of Hitler than of Stalin

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:30.320
I'm guessing almost everyone in the room has a far more negative visceral reaction to the swastika than to the hammer and sickle

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.160
Some of the protestors at your event at Macmaster University stood behind a banner with a hammer and sickle.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.820
You've said that a hammer and sickle is no funnier than a swastika.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:51.040
That, quote, "The reprehensible ideologies that are based in fundamental Marxism killed at least 100 million people in the 20th century."

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.660
I've discussed this proposition with numerous people in recent months, and almost no one seems to buy it.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:09.960
No one disputes the body count under socialist regimes. Few dispute that Stalin was a vicious murderer, roughly on par with Hitler in moral terms.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.390
In other words they share your critique of
the argument that previous communist

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.950
experiments did not represent proper
communism and that proper communism

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.000
should be tried nevertheless they still
disagree with you that we should react

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.060
as negatively to the hammer and sickle
as we do to the swastika. why? because

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.790
they say the two ideologies are not
morally comparable National Socialism is

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.549
much worse morally than Marxism or
Marxism Leninism so what do you say to

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.420
this

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.780
well I would say the first thing is
that it's highly probable that you were

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.480
talking to intellectuals

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.720
students

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.100
well
we'll call them budding intellectuals

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.269
it's it is a it is a mystery you know
it's a it's a it is a mystery because it

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.340
is the case that there is something
about the Nazi doctrine that seems to

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:30.380
have a visceral impact that that the
Communist doctrine doesn't have. And, I

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.280
said when I opened my room remarks
tonight that it might be the issue of

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.360
racial superiority, you know, it's it's
something single that you can put your

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.430
finger on, whereas what's happening on
the left that's horrifying is murky it

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.790
might even be multi-dimensional, like
maybe there isn't a single radical

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.530
leftist idea that's murderous like the
racial superiority doctrine. Maybe it's a

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.840
combination of three or maybe at some
set of four out of ten who knows so and

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.310
because of that it doesn't seem as
repugnant, and there was also a

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.690
universalizing tendency among the
communists that seemed to be less

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.890
morally reprehensible than the
ethno-nationalism of the Nazi's so you

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.420
know you think if you go back to 1914
it's complicated but if you go back to

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.299
say 1918 at the time of the Russian
Revolution it's not like the Communists

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.489
knew that their attempts to bring about
the socialist utopia would be doomed to

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.420
absolute murderous catastrophe, right? 
They were they were working in in

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.190
ignorance. Now, it's not that simple
because by that time Dostoevsky had

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.670
already written "'The Devils" ("The
Possessed") and he outlined very, very

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.739
clearly what he thought would happen if
people like that got the reins of power

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.430
and Nietzsche had done the same thing in
his writing. So, people knew that there

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.900
was something 'toxic' let's say and deadly
about the doctrine but it hadn't been

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.829
played out on the world stage, but now,
it's like, 'well this is why I said what I

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:09.290
said at the beginning', fine. You know, if... I
don't know exactly how to make the moral

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.699
distinction, but it's a distinction that
has to be made. I think that people who

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:19.040
apologize, who say something, like I think,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:27.500
I think that it's virtually, I don't know if
it's as reprehensible to say that a

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.630
given ethnic group should be consigned
to the fire and to say 'that wasn't real

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:39.020
communism', but they're damn close. And
when I hear someone say that wasn't real

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.470
communism I know what they mean what
they mean was "if I was the dictator in

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.740
Stalin's shoes, I personally would have
brought in the Utopia." That's what that

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:57.220
statement means... and, or it means an
ignorance of history that's so utterly

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:05.900
appalling that, that any political
statement made on behalf of that person

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.680
whatsoever should immediately be
followed by a paroxysm of extreme embarrassment.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.300
May I say one... I just want to be clear that these students were conceding

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.620
that they don't agree, 
that they share your critique...

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.580
They don't share it enough.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.400
Okay, fair enough *audience laughter* 
I just wanted to make that clear

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.180
so they would more or less agree with
what you just said I think about it's

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.960
not okay to say those regimes weren't
proper communism and the proper

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.470
communism should be tried they still
dispute though that socialism as an

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.342
ideology is on par with Nazism. So, I just
wanted to make that clear

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:43.060
"Well, we could say communism,

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.940
let's say we could say radical
leftist ideology as I said already there

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.820
are reasons for the left and the right
wing right the right wing stands for

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.260
hierarchy and the left wing stands for
the for those who are displaced by

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:03.680
hierarchy right an endless problem but
that doesn't mean that still leaves it

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.600
in the camp of the people speaking on
behalf of egalitarianism to figure out

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.880
just what the hell went wrong and to
take some responsibility for it you know

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.140
it's no joke and we see these things
play out continually still look at what

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.960
happened to Venezuela here's a fun story
do you know that it is now illegal for

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.880
physicians to list starvation as
the cause of death for a Venezuelan

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.749
child in a hospital that's how they're
dealing with the

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:38.089
fact of starvation right you just make
it illegal to have that diagnosed as

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:42.559
your cause of death that'll solve the
problem it's like you know we have a

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:47.539
group of of well-meaning
socialists in Canada who just produced

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:51.019
something called the leap manifesto a
couple of years ago and it's a pretty

00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:55.849
radical document
they're trying to move our Socialist

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:00.559
Party the NDP new democratic party
towards the acceptance of this leap

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:03.739
manifesto which doesn't look like it's
going to happen but they were all

00:07:03.739 --> 00:07:08.139
radical promoters of the Venezuelan
government before everything went like

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:13.819
badly sideways you know I think the
average Venezuelan now has lost 17

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:18.739
pounds that's not because they were put
on a voluntary dieting program right

00:07:18.739 --> 00:07:23.959
it's not good and so if you're tilting
towards the left and you're

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:28.069
temperamentally inclined that way and
half the population is then you have an

00:07:28.069 --> 00:07:32.839
ethical problem on your on your hands
which is how do you segregate yourself

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:37.099
from the radical policies that produced
the catastrophes of the 20th century and

00:07:37.099 --> 00:07:42.439
you can't just say well that's not my
problem it's like well okay if it's not

00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:46.429
your problem now it certainly might
become your problem in the future

00:07:46.429 --> 00:07:50.419
so and I would say it's actually
everybody's problem in the aftermath of

00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:58.179
the 20th century it's everybody's
problem so it's

00:07:58.179 --> 00:08:03.829
complicated like there is a genuine
desire like I worked for a Socialist

00:08:03.829 --> 00:08:07.729
Party for quite a while when I was a kid
you know when I saw both sides of it I

00:08:07.729 --> 00:08:14.929
saw some very very admirable people I
was privy for for a variety of chance

00:08:14.929 --> 00:08:18.919
reasons to the leadership of the
Socialist Party in Canada at the

00:08:18.919 --> 00:08:22.729
provincial and the national level. I met the
people who ran the provinces some of the

00:08:22.729 --> 00:08:26.239
provinces and who ran the party and a lot
of them were really admirable people

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:29.629
like they'd spent their whole life I
would say working on behalf of the

00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:34.370
working class you know so they were
genuine labor leaders and

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:38.509
there was also a lot done in Canada on
the left that looks like it was actually

00:08:38.509 --> 00:08:41.509
pretty good
standard work week the income you know

00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:45.800
that the establishment of pensions the
introduction of our health care system

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.860
which
I would say probably overall works

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:55.440
better than the American system although
not at the upper end and they were

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.800
working hard on behalf of people who had
working-class lives but then I also

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.400
encountered the sort of low-level
activist types and I didn't have any

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.520
respect for them at all I just thought
they were peavish and resentful and

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.851
irritable and those two things
exist in a very uneasy coalition on the

00:09:12.851 --> 00:09:17.430
west there's care for the poor and
hatred for the successful and those two

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.940
things aren't the same at all and it
looks to me like one of the things that

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.570
really happened when the Communist
doctrines were brought into play and it

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:28.950
also by the way we did the multinational
experiment right it doesn't matter where

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.760
you put these policies into play the
same bloody outcome occurred didn't

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:37.560
matter whether it was Russia or China or
Cambodia or Vietnam or to pick a random

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.300
African country or Cuba or Venezuela for
that matter it was an unmitigated

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:47.990
catastrophe and so to me that's
experiment plus replication enough

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:53.970
enough well that has to be dealt with
and it's not an delay that intellectual

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:58.590
left in the West has been absolutely
appalling in their silence on the

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:02.160
communist catastrophe like for my
students a lot of my students really

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.610
haven't heard about anything that
happened in the Soviet Union in any

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:09.450
detail until they take my personality
class in the second year of university

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.720
it's like well what the hell why are
they learning about that in a

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.030
personality class in the second year of
university that's not that should be

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:22.260
first and foremost in in their in their
historical knowledge what happened in

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.100
the twentieth century I mean it was
almost fatal what happened and we still

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.060
haven't completely recovered from it
right I think isn't your President

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:35.640
Donald Trump going to talk to like
insane totalitarian number one sometime

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.200
here in the near future but that's still
a soviet-era state those people are

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:44.490
armed to the teeth you know they have
the weapon they they have weaponry that

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:49.110
could easily take you out and so we're
not I don't know if you know do you know

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.980
what happens if you blast a single
hydrogen bomb 100 miles above the United

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:59.970
States just one you lose all your
electronics right they're all done

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:08.129
tractors cars trains subways computers
phones all of them burn out and that's

00:11:08.129 --> 00:11:14.549
it so we're not done with this yet and
and the Korean State North Korea as an

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:19.139
emblematic representative of the
communist catastrophe and everyone there

00:11:19.139 --> 00:11:25.439
starves there's millions of people died
20 years ago is had not got any better

00:11:25.439 --> 00:11:30.899
so it's not like it's not like we solved
this problem and there's a deafening

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:35.249
silence on the intellectual side of the
spectrum with regards to what happened

00:11:35.249 --> 00:11:42.349
on the egalitarian left and there's no
excuse for it so
