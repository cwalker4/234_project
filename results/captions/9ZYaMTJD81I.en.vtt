00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.640
in

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.200
modern medicine in Modern science, there's a tendency to identify

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.470
consciousness mind and Brain

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.709
Make mind a function of the brain

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:21.328
Consciousness a function of the mind and to treat them

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.319
chemically and

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:25.029
to alter them

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:31.348
chemically and that well-being is good chemistry of the brain higher consciousness is good chemistry of the brain and

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.788
Unhappiness is bad chemistry of the brain nobody is responsible, but we need to change the chemistry to make it better

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:40.510
now

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.039
In the yogic thought brain mind and consciousness are three different things

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.879
but they're related at a certain level so my questions is sadhguru Ji is the nature of

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.640
Brain mind and

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:04.980
Consciousness, how we can use the brain and mind in the proper way without getting stuck in them and the model of healing?

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.510
That is based on more consciousness than brain chemistry

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.059
In the yogic sciences that is no such thing as brain brain is just body

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.669
Like that is a heart like the liver that is a brain. It's just body I

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.309
Think this overly exaggerated sense of what is brain

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.139
Is coming because as I mentioned it a morning out here?

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.009
Our education systems have become purely intellectual

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.550
We think intellect is everything that?

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.260
Mean I mean I will try to say it in a very brief way

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.800
When you say something very complex in a brief way

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.960
There will be holes in it, please pick the holes if you find them otherwise okay?

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.739
In the yogic system. We are looking at the human mind at sixteen parts

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:14.029
The sixteen parts are in four categories the first one is buddhi. Buddhi means the intellect

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.570
Intellect, I am asking you do you want your intellect Sharp or blunt?

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.490
You all of you must choose. I'm going to bless you

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.749
You want it sharp, so intellect is essentially like a knife

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.619
You use a knife to cut things open

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.020
This is the nature of the intellect whatever you give it it will dissect

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.579
then time modern science is coming out of human intellect, so

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.080
Everything is by dissection if you give this flower to the scientist

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.600
They will rip it open and see

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.520
If you rip it open and see yes of course there are many facts

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.270
You will know about the flower only thing is you won't have the flower after that?

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.240
and

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:16.339
Now if you really want to know something let's say you really want to get to know your mother please don't dissector

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.630
that's not the way it works because

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.249
the what you can know by dissection

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.219
Is Material aspect of life?

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.820
You cannot know life by dissection

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.200
only the material and the physical can be dissected

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.639
But now we are using our intellect to understand the entire gamut of things

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.250
Now we try to dissect

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.850
we go on talking about unifying the world and

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.930
Unity and enlightenment everything with intellect this is like using a knife to stitch something

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.309
If you stitch something with a knife you leave it in tatters

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.889
So you are seeing this the more knowledge you gather about something the more?

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.300
Misunderstanding and further away from truth. We are becoming not because information is bad because we are trying to stitch with a knife

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.309
So intellect is like a knife it must be sharp

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.849
it is a survival instrument if you did not have a

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.709
Discriminatory intellect you would not be surviving on this planet very very vital

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.570
But survival is all that it can do but intellect cannot function

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.120
Unless there is a certain volume of memory if you wipe out all your memory

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:42.199
It doesn't matter how whatever you Iq is right now if you take off all your memory you will suddenly look stupid you

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:43.919
May be still intelligent

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:51.649
But you look stupid this how this happens in India people are putting rural children and urban children together and testing them

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.309
just because of the volume of information that the urban child has he looks smart a

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.329
Rural child looks stupid, but you can put them in real situations

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.799
You will see they will come out so smart because their intelligence is fully on

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.580
so

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:18.560
Intellect looks smart only when you back it up with lot of information and hence you see information technology

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.570
And everybody is mad about information. They are not looking into their phones simply for waste of time

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.859
Because only with all that bits and pieces of data

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:35.119
They look smart among their friends in the society in which they live it's only with Data they can look smart without data

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.820
They can't do one thing smart. I will just tell you an example

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:46.430
We have two different types of schools one is a modern kind of school where 30% of the children coming from the United States

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.539
in India and

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.429
Another is a completely traditional school where we teach them only yoga

00:05:53.610 --> 00:06:00.440
classical dance classical music color if I to the mother of all martial arts Sanskrit language and English language

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.139
They don't go through any academics as such

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.010
This is a Few years ago little little ones. They all run to the place to hand wash

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.049
Hand washes at this height many of the six seven year olds can't reach

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:23.630
So all this those who are going through modern education. They will go and stand there in a very civilized way wait

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.090
for a teacher or somebody to come and put a bench they will climb on the bench and then wash

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:35.119
These other kids ran there the older ones went down the end. Oh and climb on top of them wash and run away

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.640
so too much orientation towards intellect and other dimensions of

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:53.179
Intelligence are completely uncultivated today, so the next dimension of the mind is reffered to as ahankara

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:59.900
Which we have completely ignored ahankara does not mean ego as most people are beginning to think it means

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.840
Identity what are you identified with?

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:10.369
Because intellect is essentially an instrument to protect the identity that you have taken off if I say

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:16.519
I'm Indian suddenly. It is my intellect makes me think that way makes me willing to live and die for it

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.129
you will see just a piece of cloth if you show I

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.280
mean a flag

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.860
People will have tears in their eyes

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:35.419
Just the identity if you had put them somewhere else and shown another flag the same thing would happen in India Pakistan

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:43.370
It's very very striking because it was one nation and suddenly somebody draw a line and the entire emotion the way it works is

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:51.740
Amazing simply because you got identified with this or that, so intellect is an instrument which protects the identity identity

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:53.520
is that

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:59.540
Instrument which allows the intellect to function in a certain way when I say a certain way

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.709
Suppose you're identified just with this "me" as a person

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:08.450
Your intellect will do only this to protecting you all the time

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.839
All the time just doing this now

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.269
I say my identity is my family

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:21.290
Now your intellect will do everything to protect that or you say a community or race or a religion or a nation?

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:29.179
in the name of Race Religion nation how many things we have done which are utterly idiotic and inhuman but

00:08:29.729 --> 00:08:37.009
we do it with great pride because we are identified because this is the nature if we have to continue this analogy if

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.710
Intellect is the knife

00:08:40.349 --> 00:08:43.369
The hand that holds it is identity

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.840
You tell me in handling a knife

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.079
Knife is important that it must be sharp

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:57.189
But whether it becomes destructive or productive is determined by the hand that holds it isn't it?

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:03.759
But in today's society in today's world. There is no cultivation of the hand at all

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:09.699
The smaller and smaller identities that we are creating will inevitably cause

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:15.100
Disturbance within the human being and in the world there is no other way right from ancient times

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.870
in Eastern cultures

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:22.150
Always we have been taught to I have a cosmic identity. I am brahmasmi

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:28.810
At the age of 12 you must know I am burma's me. This means. I am the cosmos

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.590
without identifying with a limitless

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.770
Identity no education should be given only after identity is fixed then education

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:43.149
Because without the right kind of identity education becomes destructive

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.200
Because you have a limited identity we can say whatever we want

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:54.970
But essentially all crime all a will almost terrible things that we do is just a question of limited identity isn't it?

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.120
this is

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:01.810
This is my way that is your way this is my country this your country this my religion is your religion this all it is

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:08.379
So without cultivating the identity we are sharpening the knife we have an unsteady hand

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:15.429
But we are sharpening the knife and arming it with memory. So the next dimension of the mind is called Manus

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.369
Which is a silo of memory?

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:23.049
here there are eight dimensions of memory this starts from

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:27.249
Elemental Memory atomic Memory evolutionary Memory

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.100
Karmic Memory and

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.110
Conscious memory unconscious memory

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:38.859
Articulate memory inarticulate memory like this there are many states of memory as we already looked at this

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:47.079
This body carries the memory of everything that's happened on this planet if you pay enough attention

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:53.979
We can know simply by looking at this how evolution has happened only 150 years ago

00:10:55.730 --> 00:11:01.280
Charles Darwin talked about evolution by studying life on the planet

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:07.880
But over 15,000 years ago adI yogi spoke about how life evolved he said first

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.580
almost every Indian person is

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:14.030
Knows it but not conscious of it is

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.940
the 10 avatars

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.390
You must be studying much of it

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:25.939
The first one is fish or water life next one is amphibious

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:32.120
Next one is a mammal next one is half-man half-animal next one is a dwarf man

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.560
Next one is a full grown man

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.340
But volatile next one is a peaceful man next one is a loving man

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.299
Next one is a meditative man next one is supposed to be the mystical man

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:49.760
This is not one man. Story. This is the evolution of life on this planet, so fifteen thousand years ago

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:54.200
Somebody spoke about this by not looking into the microscope

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:58.970
But looking inward because the entire evolutionary story is written here

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.900
so the yogic system is focused on this as to how to

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:11.330
Activate different dimensions of memory because without that with limited amount of memory you are bound to act in immature ways

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:14.599
so if your intellect become super capable

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.410
Then it's very very important your identity is cosmic

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.080
Limitless Identity and

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:25.759
Your memory is evolved that all dimensions of Memory are active

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:30.799
These three function in a certain way some people have evolved it in certain ways

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:37.579
But largely it is happening in a very skewed way too much of intellect and other things are very minimalistic

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.959
The fourth Dimension of intelligence is referred to as chitta

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:46.999
This is a dimension of intelligence which is unsullied by memory

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:52.400
See we must understand this we are who we are only because of the memory that we carry

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.340
from the color of our skin

00:12:55.530 --> 00:13:01.399
To what we identify with what we are whether we are male or female or everything everything is a question of memory

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:06.410
It is the memory stored in this which is deciding all these aspects whether I?

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:09.859
am a human being or some other creature is also question of

00:13:12.029 --> 00:13:17.269
Memory is a tremendous possibility, but memory is also a limitation and a boundary

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:21.260
What is you and what is me is right now

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:26.029
The boundary of this is just memory what I remember in my system

00:13:26.029 --> 00:13:28.219
And what you remember in your system is

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:35.029
The Boundary so memory is also a boundary memory is the basis of all forms that have happened

00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:42.319
There is a certain memory which creates patterns which patterns in turn create physical forms the way

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:49.760
We are the kind of form that we have taken is essentially out of the basic memory that is there never it got

00:13:50.279 --> 00:13:54.889
Confused in the sense suppose you and a cow every day start eating mangoes

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.079
never it happens that one day by accident or by

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:04.460
Lapse of memory the cow became human or you became a cow

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.580
Both of you is the same food every day

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:13.159
But it will not happen because the memory is so strongly instinct at various levels

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.760
We are recognizing eight different dimensions of memory

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:23.690
But chitta has no memory no memory means no boundary and intelligence Beyond bounds

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.520
in the yogic culture

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:31.969
There is a mischievous way of expressing this we say if you touch your Chitta God will become your slave

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:39.200
Because your intelligence becomes boundless everything becomes within access

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:45.679
So it is very important because this is the first time we must understand

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.659
this this is the first time where our survival process is as

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.240
Organized as it is today

00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:59.239
This is the first time that human beings have so much time to look at things otherwise

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.729
Just putting the food together would take 24 hours

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:08.239
Once again in affluent societies. We are going back to the same thing as you said in Montana

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.830
Somebody has to work three jobs when so much land is there why do you need to do a job?

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:16.850
To make your food no, because you want to buy it in a Walmart

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.220
I'm saying we just kind of twisted the entire thing

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:28.700
For the first time our survival for example today you you go into your superstore

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:34.910
