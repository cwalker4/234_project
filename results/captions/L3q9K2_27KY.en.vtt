00:00:08.776 --> 00:00:09.509
FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.243
ADVISOR MICHAEL FLYNN, SAID TO

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:12.512
BE SENTENCED THIS TUESDAY FOR

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:13.379
LYING TO THE FBI, IT COMES AS

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.781
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL SHARPLY

00:00:14.782 --> 00:00:22.588
REBUKES THE FLYNN LEGAL TEAM.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.423
AND FEDERAL AGENTS HE SAID MANY

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:25.158
PLAYED HIM INTO NOT TELLING THE

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:25.458
TRUTH.

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:26.692
THIS AMID GROWING QUESTIONS OF

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:27.293
HOW THE FBI HANDLED THE

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:27.660
INTERVIEW.

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:28.394
TO ME NOW IN AN EXQUISITE

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:29.362
INTERVIEW, FROM THE WORLD AG

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:35.434
EXPO, HAS INTELLIGENCE

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:36.936
COMMITTEE CHAIR, DEVIN NUNES.

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:37.570
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:43.976
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:44.844
QUESTIONER JAMES COMEY AND

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:46.179
LAURA LYNCH HEADING TO THE HILL

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.813
TO TESTIFY.

00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:47.780
POTENTIALLY ROD ROSENSTEIN.

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:48.681
I WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:49.215
ALL OF THAT.

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:55.188
BUT FIRST, WE HEARD ABOUT THE

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:56.122
SENTENCING FOR MICHAEL FLYNN.

00:00:56.123 --> 00:00:57.390
HE WAS SENTENCED THIS WEEK.

00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:58.391
BUT THERE IS A LOT OF DEBATE ON

00:00:58.392 --> 00:00:59.192
WHETHER OR NOT THE CONDUCT THAT

00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:00.693
THE FBI DID IN TERMS OF GETTING

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:07.133
HIM TO SAY THAT HE LIED WAS

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:08.267
REALLY NOT GOOD CONDUCT.

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:08.801
TELL ME ABOUT THAT.

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:10.503
THERE WAS A WALL STREET JOURNAL

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:10.803
OP-ED.

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:11.871
THEY SAID IT WAS ENTRAPMENT.

00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:16.542
THAT MICHAEL FLYNN WAS TRAPPED

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:17.243
INTO SAYING HE BROKE THE LAW.

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:19.245
YOUR REACTION?

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:20.379
&gt;&gt; I THINK WHAT WAS LIKELY IS

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.450
THAT GENERAL FLYNN WAS JUST OUT

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.184
OF MONEY.

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:26.652
IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:27.353
DOCUMENTATION IS COME OUT IN

00:01:27.354 --> 00:01:28.054
THE LAST WEEK, I THINK MOST

00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:31.057
NOTABLE IS THE ONE LINE THAT

00:01:31.058 --> 00:01:31.657
SAYS THAT GENERAL FLYNN

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:32.425
ACTUALLY KNEW THAT THE AGENTS

00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:36.495
MUST HAVE HAD THE TRANSCRIPTS.

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:37.530
SO LOOK, GENERAL FLYNN IS A

00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:39.031
FORMER HEAD OF THE DIA.

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:39.765
30 YEARS IN MILITARY SERVICE.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:43.035
HE HAS TO KNOW WHEN THE AGENTS

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:45.271
START TO TALK ABOUT HIS

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:51.210
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE RUSSIAN

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:52.111
AMBASSADOR THAT THEY HAVE THE

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:52.712
TRANSCRIPT.

00:01:52.713 --> 00:01:53.579
SOME OF IT HAD ALREADY LEAKED

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.846
OUT.

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:55.047
SO GENERAL FLYNN THOUGH THEY

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:57.016
HAVE THE TRANSCRIPT.

00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:58.050
SO I GENERAL FLYNN GOING TO LIE

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:02.889
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HE KNOWS

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.723
THEY HAVE, EXACTLY WHAT HE

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:04.190
SAID.

00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:04.891
AND HE NEVER MADE ANY SENSE

00:02:04.892 --> 00:02:06.158
FROM THE BEGINNING.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:06.926
I THINK THE MORE LIKELY

00:02:06.927 --> 00:02:08.160
SCENARIO IS THAT GENERAL FLYNN

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:10.062
WAS OUT OF MONEY, HOW DO WE

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:10.596
KNOW THAT?

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:11.497
NOT BECAUSE HE TOLD ME BUT HE

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:14.400
HAD TO SELL HIS HOUSE.

00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:15.001
TO PAY HIS LEGAL BILLS.

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:16.102
THEN WHAT YOU SEEN, EVEN THOUGH

00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:17.970
IT'S BEEN A YEAR SINCE HE SAID

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:24.176
LOOK, FINE, I LIED TO YOU GUYS,

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:24.944
YOU CAN TRUST ME ON THIS

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:25.778
KNOWING IS NOT GETTING JAIL

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:27.013
TIME, ROBERT MUELLER COMES OUT

00:02:27.014 --> 00:02:27.914
AND SAYS WE ARE NOT GOING TO

00:02:27.915 --> 00:02:28.581
GIVE HIM JAIL TIME.

00:02:28.582 --> 00:02:29.515
KNOWING THAT THROUGH ALL OF

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:30.750
THIS TIME, LIKELY, THIS WAS

00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:32.485
JUST A WAY FOR GENERAL FLYNN TO

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:37.423
JUST END THE INVESTIGATION

00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:37.823
AGAINST HIM.

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:38.925
MARIA: BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE

00:02:38.926 --> 00:02:39.792
SPECULATE MAYBE HE WAS WORRIED

00:02:39.793 --> 00:02:40.693
THAT THEY WOULD THROW THE BOOK

00:02:40.694 --> 00:02:41.727
AT HIS SON.

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:42.461
THAT BASICALLY, THEY PUT HIM IN

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:43.195
A CORNER AND COERCED HIM INTO

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:50.469
SAYING THINGS LIKE, I LIED AND

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.903
BROKE THE LAW.

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:51.971
THAT'S THE WAY THE WALL STREET

00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:52.471
JOURNAL WRITES IT.

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:53.572
DATE JOURNAL EDITORIAL PUT OUT

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:56.876
AN ARTICLE LAST WEEK TITLED THE

00:02:56.877 --> 00:02:57.410
FLYNN ENTRAPMENT.

00:02:57.411 --> 00:02:57.977
IT READS IN PART THIS.

00:02:57.978 --> 00:02:58.911
NOT A RICH MAN AT THE DECADES

00:02:58.912 --> 00:02:59.345
IN UNIFORM.

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.179
MR. FLYNN PLEADED GUILTY TO

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.348
AVOID BANKRUPTCY AND SPARE HIS

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.149
SON FROM BECOMING A LEGAL

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.482
TARGET.

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:04.550
MR. FLYNN'S FILING DOES NOT

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:05.484
TAKE ISSUE WITH THE DESCRIPTION

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:07.053
OF HIS OFFENSE.

00:03:07.054 --> 00:03:08.321
BUT THE ADDITIONAL FACTS, THE

00:03:08.322 --> 00:03:17.630
FLYNN DEFENSE TEAM, IT RAISES

00:03:17.631 --> 00:03:17.930
DOUBT.

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:18.965
YOU'VE BEEN IN THE EYE THE

00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:19.699
ENTIRE YEAR WHAT'S YOUR

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.969
REACTION TO THE CONDUCT?

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:23.703
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS IS THAT WE

00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:26.672
ARE ACTUALLY NEVER ABLE TO

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:27.406
INTERVIEW THE SECOND FBI AGENT

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:32.678
THAT WAS THERE IN THE

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:33.179
INTERVIEW.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.113
WE HAVE CHUCK GRASSLEY, SENATOR

00:03:34.114 --> 00:03:35.047
GRASSLEY AND HIS TEAM HAVE BEEN

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:35.815
ASKING TO GET THOSE, THE

00:03:35.816 --> 00:03:37.516
ORIGINAL FBI REPORTS THAT CAME

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:40.486
OUT OF THE FLYNN INTERVIEW.

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:42.288
SO THERE IS SO MUCH OUT THERE

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:43.189
THAT WE NEED TO KNOW STILL THAT

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.157
I AM REALLY HOPEFUL THAT THE

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:47.793
JUDGE DIDN'T JUST RECEIVE THIS

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:50.963
INTERVIEW WITH PETER STRZOK

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:51.931
THAT YOU SAW ON FRIDAY

00:03:51.932 --> 00:03:52.298
AFTERNOON.

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.633
I REALLY DO HOPE THAT HE

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:55.935
ACTUALLY GOT ALL OF THE

00:03:55.936 --> 00:03:58.838
MEMORANDUMS, ALL OF THE MEMOS,

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:59.505
EVERYTHING THAT WAS WRITTEN

00:03:59.506 --> 00:03:59.905
AFTER THAT.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:00.706
BECAUSE IT WAS CLEAR FROM ALL

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:01.774
OF OUR INVESTIGATIONS THAT WE

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:03.009
HAD DONE, THAT THE FBI AGENTS

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.846
WHO'D INTERVIEWED MICHAEL FLYNN

00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:08.147
DID NOTHING THE GENERAL FLYNN

00:04:08.148 --> 00:04:08.881
WAS LYING AND THEN IT DOES NOT

00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:10.750
PASS A SIMPLE STRAIGHT FACE

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:11.450
TEST THE GENERAL FLYNN WOULD

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:18.991
LIE WHEN HE KNOWS THAT THEY

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:20.159
HAVE THE TRANSCRIPTS OF HIS

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.060
CONVERSATION WITH THE RUSSIAN

00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:21.460
AMBASSADOR.

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:22.962
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO GET BACK TO THAT.

00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:23.696
IT APPEARS THAT ROBERT MUELLER

00:04:23.697 --> 00:04:24.196
SCRUB THE PHONES.

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:25.297
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:29.668
TEXTS ARE OUT THERE.

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.070
BUT JAMES COMEY SUGGESTED THAT

00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:32.471
HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF WHAT HE

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:35.741
PERCEIVED AS A DISORGANIZED

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:36.208
ADMINISTRATION.

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:37.343
AND HE BASICALLY SAID THE WAY

00:04:37.344 --> 00:04:42.515
WE QUESTION MICHAEL FLYNN WAS

00:04:42.516 --> 00:04:43.382
DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING IN THE

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:44.016
PAST.

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:44.617
WATCH THIS MOST RECENT

00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:44.984
INTERVIEW.

00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:47.053
THIS IS BACK ON DECEMBER 9 AT

00:04:47.054 --> 00:04:47.787
THE 92ND STREET Y WITH JAMES

00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:48.287
COMEY.

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:52.124
WATCH.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:52.958
&gt;&gt; SOMETHING I PROBABLY WOULD

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.360
NOT PRESENT OR GOTTEN AWAY WITH

00:04:54.361 --> 00:05:00.099
MAY BE IN A MORE ORGANIZED

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.833
INVESTIGATION, THE MORE

00:05:00.834 --> 00:05:01.734
ORGANIZED ADMINISTRATION IN THE

00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:02.635
GEORGE W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION

00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:04.403
FOR EXAMPLE OR OBAMA ADMIN

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:04.737
STATION.

00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:05.371
IN BOTH THERE WAS PROCESS.

00:05:05.372 --> 00:05:06.138
AND SO THE FBI WANTED TO SEND

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.576
AGENTS INTO THE WHITE HOUSE

00:05:10.577 --> 00:05:11.977
ITSELF TO INTERVIEW A SENIOR

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:12.344
OFFICIAL.

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:13.012
YOU WOULD WORK THROUGH THE

00:05:13.013 --> 00:05:14.780
WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL AND THERE

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:15.381
WILL BE DISCUSSIONS AND

00:05:15.382 --> 00:05:21.120
APPROVALS AND WHO WOULD BE

00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:21.420
THERE.

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:23.055
AND I THOUGHT, IT IS EARLY

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:23.689
ENOUGH, LET'S JUST SEND A

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.223
COUPLE OF GUYS OVER.

00:05:24.224 --> 00:05:24.990
&gt;&gt; HE BASICALLY ADMITS THAT THE

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:25.658
WHOLE THING WAS PLANNED.

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:27.059
PREMEDITATED TO SEND AGENTS IN

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.260
AND HOPE HE DOES NOT HAVE

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:32.498
LAWYERS AROUND HIM.

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:33.365
&gt;&gt; IT IS FRIGHTENING, MARIA

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:36.102
THAT THE HEAD OF THE FBI WHO IS

00:05:36.103 --> 00:05:41.941
ON A 10 YEAR APPOINTMENT, THE

00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:42.541
REASON WE HAVE 10 YEAR

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:43.242
APPOINTMENTS IS SO THAT THERE

00:05:43.243 --> 00:05:44.910
IS SOME CONTINUITY OF

00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:45.311
GOVERNMENT.

00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:48.581
THE JOB OF THE BUREAUCRACY IS

00:05:48.582 --> 00:05:51.050
TO SUPPORT, NO MATTER WHO THE

00:05:51.051 --> 00:05:56.355
PEOPLE DECIDE WINS THE

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:56.722
ELECTION?

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:57.656
WHETHER IT IS REPUBLICAN OR

00:05:57.657 --> 00:05:58.591
DEMOCRAT THE BUREAUCRACY IN

00:05:58.592 --> 00:05:59.458
WASHINGTON AND THE SWAMP SHOULD

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:01.460
BE THERE TO SUPPORT THE

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:01.927
ADMINISTRATION.

00:06:01.928 --> 00:06:03.696
NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:04.196
ADMINISTRATION.

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.832
AND THAT IS WHY YOU HEAR THIS

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:08.400
YOU KNOW, CALLED THE SWAMP

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:10.369
THERE IT IS EXACTLY CASES LIKE

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.669
THIS.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.573
YOU HAVE THE FBI DIRECTOR WHO

00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:15.541
WAS ON A 10 YEAR TERM THAT

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.144
DECIDES HE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE

00:06:18.145 --> 00:06:19.111
OF A DISORGANIZED TRANSITION

00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:20.880
GOING INTO WASHINGTON AS HE PUT

00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:22.948
IT.

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:23.682
AND THAT IS, I THINK, ABOVE ALL

00:06:23.683 --> 00:06:25.284
ELSE, IT IS ALARMING THAT

00:06:25.285 --> 00:06:32.424
ANYBODY IN THE FEDERAL

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:33.125
BUREAUCRACY WOULD THINK THAT

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:33.392
WAY.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:34.226
I THINK THIS WAY SEE SO MANY

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:36.295
AMERICANS DISILLUSIONED WITH

00:06:36.296 --> 00:06:36.695
WASHINGTON.

00:06:36.696 --> 00:06:37.663
DONALD TRUMP IS IN EVERYTHING

00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:39.064
HE CAN DO TO DRAIN THE SWAMP AS

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.933
HE CALLED IT.

00:06:40.934 --> 00:06:42.268
I DON'T THINK ANY OF THAT WILL

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:43.102
HAPPEN IT'S A START TO GET

00:06:43.103 --> 00:06:43.936
THESE AGENCIES OUT OF

00:06:43.937 --> 00:06:44.737
WASHINGTON D.C.. WE GIVE 90

00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:47.039
PERCENT OF THE POPULACE IN

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.641
WASHINGTON D.C. AND 90 PERCENT

00:06:48.642 --> 00:06:49.775
OF THE WORKFORCE THAT VOTE

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:51.043
EXTREME LEFT AND VOTE FOR

00:06:51.044 --> 00:06:52.411
DEMOCRATS, EVEN ON A

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:52.945
SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM.

00:06:52.946 --> 00:06:56.182
I THINK WILL BE HELPFUL TO GET

00:06:56.183 --> 00:06:57.316
YOU KNOW, THE EPA, DEPARTMENT

00:06:57.317 --> 00:06:59.185
OF INTERIOR, SOME OF THESE

00:06:59.186 --> 00:07:04.156
AGENCIES OUT TO WHERE THE REST

00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:05.057
OF AMERICA LIVES AND THEY MIGHT

00:07:05.058 --> 00:07:06.292
BE A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE

00:07:06.293 --> 00:07:06.625
PEOPLE.

00:07:06.626 --> 00:07:12.865
MARIA: IS MENTIONED THE 302'S.

00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:13.832
THE REPORT YOU BEEN ASKING FOR.

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:16.835
MORE REPORTS SO-CALLED 302'S

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:17.670
WERE RELEASED ON FRIDAY.

00:07:17.671 --> 00:07:18.637
THE PRESIDENT TWEETED ABOUT IT.

00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:20.706
I WANT TO SAY WHAT HE SAID OVER

00:07:20.707 --> 00:07:23.676
THE WEEKEND AND THIS MORNING

00:07:23.677 --> 00:07:24.410
ABOUT THESE REPORTS.

00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:25.711
THEN GET YOUR REACTION TO WHAT

00:07:25.712 --> 00:07:27.079
YOU'VE SEEN AND WHAT IS STILL

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:27.413
MISSING.

00:07:27.414 --> 00:07:35.654
THE PRESIDENT TWEETED THIS.

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:36.722
WHERE ARE ALL OF THE MISSING

00:07:36.723 --> 00:07:37.456
TEXT MESSAGES?

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:38.190
BETWEEN FIRED FBI AGENTS, PETER

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:39.158
STRZOK AND THE LOVELY, LISA

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:39.658
PAIGE, HIS LOVER?

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:42.595
JUST REPORTED THEY HAVE BEEN

00:07:42.596 --> 00:07:43.362
ERASED AND WIPED CLEAN.

00:07:43.363 --> 00:07:44.763
WHAT AN OUTRAGE AS THE TOTALLY

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:45.664
COMPROMISED AND CONFLICTED

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:47.700
WITCHHUNT MOVES EVER SO SLOWLY

00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:50.536
FORWARD.

00:07:50.537 --> 00:07:51.136
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:54.840
&gt;&gt; MY GUESS IS THAT THE MUELLER

00:07:54.841 --> 00:07:57.676
TEAM HAD TO GET RID OF LISA

00:07:57.677 --> 00:07:58.577
PAIGE AND PETER STRZOK BECAUSE

00:07:58.578 --> 00:07:59.812
THE IG DISCOVERED THEY WERE

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:03.382
BIASED AGAINST THE WHITE HOUSE

00:08:03.383 --> 00:08:08.087
AND PEOPLE THEY WERE

00:08:08.088 --> 00:08:08.520
INVESTIGATING.

00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:09.622
AND SO, I THINK IT WAS A SIMPLE

00:08:09.623 --> 00:08:10.489
MATTER OF WHAT WE HAVE SEEN THE

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.293
DOJ AND FBI DO.

00:08:14.294 --> 00:08:15.027
THEY QUICKLY HIDE THE BALL AND

00:08:15.028 --> 00:08:18.864
COVER UP THEIR TRACKS, HOPING

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:19.531
THAT NO ONE WOULD ACTUALLY

00:08:19.532 --> 00:08:21.233
CATCH THEM IN THIS.

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:22.134
AND YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT YOU

00:08:22.135 --> 00:08:26.238
KNOW THAT YOU HAVE TWO BIASED

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:26.972
AGENTS AND YOU WOULD ERASE ANY

00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:27.673
OF THEIR PHONES, WHAT SHOULD

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:28.874
HAVE BEEN IMMEDIATELY HAPPENED

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:34.947
WAS THE PHONES YOU KNOW, ANY

00:08:34.948 --> 00:08:35.814
DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANT WOULD

00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:36.682
HAVE SAID LOOK, I AM NOT GOING

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:37.516
TO OBSTRUCT AN INVESTIGATION.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:38.717
THESE EMPLOYEES DID WRONG.

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:39.551
THOSE PHONES SHOULD HAVE BEEN

00:08:39.552 --> 00:08:40.552
TURNED OVER IMMEDIATELY TO THE

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:40.953
IG.

00:08:40.954 --> 00:08:48.027
SO THE IG COULD CONDUCT

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:48.861
INVESTIGATION PIERCES THEY

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:49.662
DIDN'T DO THAT, THESE ARE

00:08:49.663 --> 00:08:50.996
SOPHISTICATED OPERATORS, SOME

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:51.764
OF THE BEST WE HAVE IN ALL OF

00:08:51.765 --> 00:08:52.665
GOVERNMENT THAT HAVE WORKED AT

00:08:52.666 --> 00:08:53.499
DOJ AND FBI FOR LONG TIME.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.767
THE FACT THAT THEY WOULDN'T

00:08:54.768 --> 00:08:55.601
TURN THEM OVER IS JUST ANOTHER

00:08:55.602 --> 00:08:56.869
ALARMING FACT AND A DISTURBING

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:02.941
SET OF FACTS THAT CONTINUES IN

00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:03.342
THIS FIASCO.

00:09:03.343 --> 00:09:04.443
MARIA: IS JUST EXTERNAL REPAIR

00:09:04.444 --> 00:09:05.344
WHICH IS WHY THE WALL STREET

00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:06.178
JOURNAL CAME OUT WITH ANOTHER

00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:07.112
OP-ED TITLED CHECKING ROBERT

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:07.446
MUELLER.

00:09:07.447 --> 00:09:10.449
A JUDGE BRINGS TO LIGHT THE FBI

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:11.884
DODGY CONDUCT IN THE MICHAEL

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:15.988
FLYNN CASE.

00:09:15.989 --> 00:09:16.722
AND YOU WANT TO BREAKING NEWS

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:17.489
THIS MORNING IN TERMS OF WHAT

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.325
YOU WILL BE CALLING FOR IN THE

00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:19.758
NEW CONGRESS.

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:23.362
TO TRY TO GET YOUR ARMS AROUND

00:09:23.363 --> 00:09:24.530
THIS STREAM OF INFORMATION THAT

00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:25.464
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE YET TO

00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:25.731
SEE.

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:28.100
TELL US ABOUT WHAT YOU WILL BE

00:09:28.101 --> 00:09:31.904
CALLING FOR IN 2019.

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:34.606
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MARIA.

00:09:34.607 --> 00:09:35.541
AS YOU KNOW, I'VE SAID THIS

00:09:35.542 --> 00:09:39.445
LAST MONTH ASHLEY COUPLE OF

00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:39.912
MONTHS.

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.080
OUR INVESTIGATIONS ESSENTIALLY,

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:41.413
OVER.

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:44.717
WE HAVE EVERYTHING THAT WE

00:09:44.718 --> 00:09:45.017
NEED.

00:09:45.018 --> 00:09:46.151
BUT WE ARE LACKING NOW IS, WE

00:09:46.152 --> 00:09:46.885
ARE LACKING THE

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:47.486
DECLASSIFICATION BY THE

00:09:47.487 --> 00:09:47.853
PRESIDENT.

00:09:47.854 --> 00:09:48.887
AND FOR VARIOUS REASONS, THE

00:09:48.888 --> 00:09:50.489
PRESIDENT OR HIS STAFF DOESN'T

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.090
WANT TO DO IT.

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:53.525
THEREFORE I THINK IT IS

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:54.360
IMPORTANT IF THE PRESIDENT

00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:55.260
DOESN'T WANT HIS HANDS AND WE

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:57.229
HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.464
SOME OFFICE THAT WILL LOOK AT

00:09:58.465 --> 00:10:00.699
ALL OF THESE ISSUES AND ALL OF

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.633
THESE DOCUMENTS THAT NEED TO BE

00:10:01.634 --> 00:10:02.368
DECLASSIFIED.I THINK THE

00:10:02.369 --> 00:10:04.970
PRESIDENT WANTS TO CREATE SOME

00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:05.637
TYPE OF OFFICE LIKE THIS, I

00:10:05.638 --> 00:10:09.341
WILL BE WORKING WITH MY

00:10:09.342 --> 00:10:10.075
COLLEAGUES TO WORK ON AND SEND

00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:12.044
SOME EXAMPLE OVER TO THE

00:10:12.045 --> 00:10:12.911
PRESIDENT OF A TRANSPARENCY

00:10:12.912 --> 00:10:18.250
TYPE OF OFFICE.

00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:19.051
SO THAT THE CONGRESS, THE

00:10:19.052 --> 00:10:20.319
AMERICAN PEOPLE, OTHERS CAN PUT

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.055
IN REQUESTS OF DOCUMENTS OR

00:10:23.056 --> 00:10:23.956
ISSUES THAT THEY WANT

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:24.390
DECLASSIFIED.

00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:25.891
THAT WAY THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T

00:10:25.892 --> 00:10:27.993
HAVE TO TAKE THIS FULL BURDEN

00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:28.927
ON AND THE CONGRESS HAS

00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:35.401
SOMEWHERE WE CAN GO TO TO TRY

00:10:35.402 --> 00:10:36.268
AND AVOID THE SWAMP PREACHERS

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:37.736
FROM GETTING INVOLVED IN

00:10:37.737 --> 00:10:38.504
ASSURING THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS

00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:39.004
KEPT IN THE DARK.

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:39.805
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:50.382
IS LIGHT, I WOULD SAY THAT THE

00:10:50.383 --> 00:10:51.884
SUNLIGHT IS THE DISINFECTANT IN

00:10:51.885 --> 00:10:52.284
WASHINGTON.

00:10:52.285 --> 00:10:53.385
THE MORE THAT WE CAN GET

00:10:53.386 --> 00:10:54.186
DECLASSIFIED, I THINK THE

00:10:54.187 --> 00:10:54.520
BETTER.

00:10:54.521 --> 00:10:55.220
ANYTHING AN EASY WAY TO DO IS

00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:56.922
CREATE AN OFFICE THAT ACTUALLY

00:10:56.923 --> 00:10:57.589
JUST WORKS UNDER THE WHITE

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:58.257
HOUSE THAT SPECIALIZES IN

00:10:58.258 --> 00:11:03.028
EVALUATING THIS DOCUMENTATION

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:06.865
TO GET, AND ERRORS ON THE SIDE

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:07.733
OF MORE SOME OF THE BETTER TO

00:11:07.734 --> 00:11:08.934
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WENT

00:11:08.935 --> 00:11:09.668
DECLASSIFIED GUESS

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:10.102
DECLASSIFIED.

00:11:10.103 --> 00:11:11.170
&gt;&gt; WE ARE SPEAKING WITH YOU ALL

00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:12.137
YEAR AS YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS

00:11:12.138 --> 00:11:12.905
INVESTIGATION INTO THE FBI

00:11:12.906 --> 00:11:14.940
HANDLING OF THIS PROBE INTO THE

00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:17.910
TRUMP CAMPAIGN AFTER POTENTIAL

00:11:17.911 --> 00:11:19.077
COLLUSION ALONGSIDE THE

00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:22.247
INVESTIGATION OF HILLARY

00:11:22.248 --> 00:11:22.748
CLINTON'S EMAILS.

00:11:22.749 --> 00:11:25.217
AND ANOTHER ROBERT MUELLER WAS

00:11:25.218 --> 00:11:26.185
WANTING THE FBI DURING THE FBI

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:29.321
THAT THE CLINTON GLOBAL

00:11:29.322 --> 00:11:30.222
INITIATIVE WAS OPERATING.

00:11:30.223 --> 00:11:32.324
NATIVE WHISTLEBLOWERS COMING

00:11:32.325 --> 00:11:33.125
OUT ON THE CLINTON GLOBAL

00:11:33.126 --> 00:11:36.161
INITIATIVE AND THE CLINTON

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:36.762
FOUNDATION.

00:11:36.763 --> 00:11:37.729
MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.198
THESE ARE ALL THE SAME PLAYERS

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:40.032
WHO WERE ACTUALLY RUNNING

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:42.034
THINGS AT THE GOVERNMENT

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:42.701
AGENCIES THAT ARE NOW

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:47.506
INVESTIGATING THAT SAME THING.

00:11:47.507 --> 00:11:48.607
LIKE ROBERT MUELLER!

00:11:48.608 --> 00:11:49.541
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ROBERT

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:50.909
MUELLER 'S PROBE AND WHEN IT IS

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:51.243
ENDING?

00:11:51.244 --> 00:11:55.481
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO IDEA WHEN IT IS

00:11:55.482 --> 00:11:55.948
ENDING.

00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:56.648
I'VE SAID THIS FOR MONTHS NOW.

00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:57.749
HE NEEDS TO ANSWER BECAUSE IT

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.319
IS DESTROYING AMERICA.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.086
YOU HAVE OVER 40 PERCENT OF THE

00:12:01.087 --> 00:12:02.721
AMERICAN PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:05.424
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN COLLUDED

00:12:05.425 --> 00:12:05.824
WITH RUSSIA.

00:12:05.825 --> 00:12:06.959
EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NOT ONE

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.527
SHRED OF EVIDENCE THAT IT

00:12:08.528 --> 00:12:08.894
HAPPENED.

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:09.895
IN FACT, THE ONLY EVIDENCE WE

00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:14.500
KNOW FOR SURE IS THAT THE

00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:15.133
DEMOCRATS AND THE HILLARY

00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:19.171
CAMPAIGN COLLUDED DIRECTLY WITH

00:12:19.172 --> 00:12:19.538
RUSSIANS.

00:12:19.539 --> 00:12:20.639
BY HIRING THE FOREIGN AGENT TO

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.874
GO TALK TO RUSSIANS TO GET DIRT

00:12:21.875 --> 00:12:22.474

LET'S NOT FORGET ONE OF THE

00:12:30.283 --> 00:12:31.116
LAWYERS FOR THE CLINTON

00:12:31.117 --> 00:12:31.984

PRESIDENT.

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.087

00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:38.757
TAKING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:39.491
DOLLARS FROM NOT JUST RUSSIANS,

00:12:39.492 --> 00:12:42.060
BUT OTHER COUNTRIES AND AT THE

00:12:42.061 --> 00:12:42.928
SAME TIME, WHY THOSE COUNTRIES

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:45.097
HAD BUSINESS BEFORE THE STATE

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:47.933

00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:48.500
WAS THERE.

00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:51.837
THERE IS ALL KINDS OF

00:12:51.838 --> 00:12:53.138
