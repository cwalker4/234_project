WE'RE BACK WITH NEW JERSEY
SENATOR AND DEMOCRATIC

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN HOPEFUL
CORY BOOKER.

00:00:07.873 --> 00:00:10.076
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME SPECIFIC
POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN THROWN

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:12.678 size:84% position:42%
OUT BY THE NEW DEMOCRATS IN
CONGRESS AND BY SOME OF THE

00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:14.547 align:start position:0%
PEOPLE--
&gt;&gt; I CAN JUST SAY ONE THING

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.550 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE THIS NEWS CAME OUT ABOUT
PAUL MANAFORT, AND I'M REALLY

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:18.651 align:start position:0%
TICKED OFF ABOUT THIS.

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:19.886 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YESTERDAY,
THURSDAY.

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:24.424
&gt;&gt; YES, YESTERDAY CAME OUT--
WELL, ONE OF MY FRIENDS SAYS WE

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:27.760
HAVE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
THAT TREATS YOU BETTER IF YOU'RE

00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:30.029 align:start position:0%
RICH AND GUILTY THAN IF YOU'RE
POOR AND INNOCENT.

00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:31.964 size:81% position:41%
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE FROM
NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE MINE IN

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:34.967
AMERICA WHO GET CONVICTIONS FOR
DOING THINGS THAT TWO OF THE

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.536 align:start position:0%
LAST THREE PRESIDENTS ADMITTED
TO DOING.

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:40.973
WE ARE A NATION RIGHT NOW THAT
CHURNS INTO OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE

00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:42.275 align:start position:0%
SYSTEM THE MOST VULNERABLE
PEOPLE.

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:47.313 align:start position:0%
YOU CAN TELL A LOT ABOUT A
COUNTRY BY WHO THEY INCARCERATE.

00:00:47.346 --> 00:00:48.414 align:start position:0%
IN TURKEY, THEY'RE INCARCERATING
THE MEDIA.

00:00:48.447 --> 00:00:50.016 align:start position:0%
BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU TRAVEL
THERE, SIR.

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:54.454
BUT IN OUR COUNTRY, WE PREY UPON
THE MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS IN

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:58.458 align:start position:0%
OUR NATION-- POOR FOLKS,
MENTALLY ILL FOLKS, ADDICTED

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:02.829 align:start position:0%
FOLKS, AND OVERWHELMINGLY BRACK
BLACKAND BROWN FOLKS?

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:07.333 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU WERE SHOCKED
THAT HE GOT ONLY FOUR YEARS.

00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:10.002 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO, CRIMINAL JUSTICE CAN'T
SHOCK ME ANYMORE.

00:01:10.035 --> 00:01:15.508 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: EVEN THOUGH THE
MUELLER TEAM SAID, 19-24, THEY

00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:16.776 size:78% position:39%
SAID HE WAS IRREDEEMABLE.

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:19.846 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T BELIEVE IN
IRREDEEMABLE --

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:23.382 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THEY SAID A HIGH
RISK OF RECIDIVISM.

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:24.750
THAT HE IS A HARDEN CRIMINAL.

00:01:24.783 --> 00:01:27.653
&gt;&gt; YES, AND HE IS SOMEBODY THAT
DONE DTHINGS THAT UNDERMINED

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:28.687 align:start position:0%
THIS INVESTIGATION.

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:32.058 size:81% position:41%
SO EVERYBODY-- THAT'S SO
DELEGITIMIZES OUR CRIMINAL

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:33.326 align:start position:0%
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.462
THERE ARE PEOPLE IN PRISON RIGHT
NEW-- I HAD A GUY THAT WENT WITH

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:39.365 size:88% position:44%
ME TO THE STATE OF THE UNION
ADDRESS, THE LEGISLATION I

00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:43.069
WORKED ON WITH OTHER SENATORS,
LIBERATED, WHO WAS IN JAIL FOR

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:47.039
LIFE FOR BEING IN POSSESSION OF
CRACK COCAINE THAT WEIGHED LESS

00:01:47.072 --> 00:01:49.142 align:start position:0%
THAN A BASEBALL AIR, LIFE
SENTENCE.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:52.478
AND HERE IS A GUY THAT BETRAYED
OUR NATION, THAT THE PROSECUTORS

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:55.948 align:start position:0%
SAID-- THAT THE SENTENCES
GUIDELINES SAID OVER 19 YEARS,

00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:59.152 align:start position:0%
AND HE'S GETTING OUT WITH A SLAP
ON THE WRIST.

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:05.491
WHAT DOES THAT SAY TO PEOPLE IN
THE COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE THAT,

00:02:05.524 --> 00:02:06.893
THIS IS THE KIND OF INJUSTICE.

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:10.096 align:start position:0%
WE SAY THE WE'RE THE LAND OF THE
THREE, BUT ONE OUT OF EVERY

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.698
THREE INCARCERATED WOMEN ON THE
PLANET EARTH ARE HERE IN THE

00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:14.066 size:78% position:39%
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.434 align:start position:0%
WHICH WOMEN?

00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:16.569 align:start position:0%
THE MOST VULNERABLE.

00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:20.006
SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL AASSAULT.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.074 align:start position:0%
LOW-INCOME FOLKS.

00:02:22.107 --> 00:02:25.511
OVERWHELMINGLY THE MAJORITY OF
WOMEN WE INCARCERATE ARE LOW

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:26.445 align:start position:0%
INCOME.

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:27.713 align:start position:0%
THIS IS A CANCER ON THE SOUL OF
OUR COUNTRY.

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:30.483
WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY TO ME IS
JUST YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE

00:02:30.516 --> 00:02:31.951 align:start position:0%
WORK WE HAVE TO DO.

00:02:31.984 --> 00:02:37.290
WE SWEAR-- I HAVE THING, BEFORE
YOU TELL ME ABOUT YOUR RELIGION,

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:40.459 align:start position:0%
FIRST SHOW IT TO ME IN HOW YOU
TREAT OTHER PEOPLE.

00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
<i> PEOPLE.</i>

00:02:41.393 --> 00:02:43.129 align:start position:0%
<i> ( APPLAUSE )</i>
WE HAVE A CIVIC GOSPEL.

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:46.933
WE HAVE A CIVIC GOSPEL THAT WE
ALL SWEAR AN OATH TO IN THIS

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:48.201 align:start position:0%
COUNTRY.

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:49.702
WE SWEAR AN OATH THAT WE WILL BE
A NATION OF LIBERTY AND JUSTICE

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:50.369 align:start position:0%
FOR ALL.

00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:51.303 align:start position:0%
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:52.939 align:start position:0%
AND WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT IN
THIS COUNTRY.

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:55.675
AND THAT'S WHY I INTRODUCED
LEGISLATION THIS WEEK TO SAY,

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:59.879 align:start position:0%
OKAY, WE DID THE FIRST STEP ACT,
WHICH IS A GOOD PROGRESS.

00:02:59.912 --> 00:03:02.648 align:start position:0%
BUT NOW IT'S TIME WE DO THE NEXT
STEP ACT.

00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:04.283 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE JUST THINK ABOUT THE
PROBLEMS WE TALK ABOUT.

00:03:04.316 --> 00:03:05.751 size:88% position:44%
YOU TALK ABOUT OTHER ISSUES.

00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:07.653 align:start position:0%
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH OUR
CHILDREN, WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

00:03:07.686 --> 00:03:08.921 align:start position:0%
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:11.824
WE ARE BUILDING A NEW PRISON IN
THIS COUNTRY EVERY 10 DAYS FROM

00:03:11.857 --> 00:03:15.294
THE TIME I WAS IN LAW SCHOOL TO
THE TIME I WAS MAYOR OF THE CITY

00:03:15.327 --> 00:03:17.597 align:start position:0%
OF NEWARK, WHILE OUR
INFRASTRUCTURE WAS CRUMB BLIRNG

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.999 align:start position:0%
WE WERE BUILDING OUT THE BIGGEST
INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE PLANET

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:22.501
EARTH FOR INCARCERATING PEOPLE.

00:03:22.534 --> 00:03:25.371
THINK ABOUT THIS-- ONCE YOU GET
AN INDICTMENT OR A CONVICTION

00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:30.376 align:start position:0%
FOR DOING THINGS THAT NOW
SENATORS ADMIT TO DOING-- "OH, I

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:34.313 align:start position:0%
SMOKED MARIJUANA"-- THERE WERE
MORE MARIJUANA POSSESSION

00:03:34.346 --> 00:03:37.717 align:start position:0%
ARRESTS IN 2017 THAN ALL THE
VIOLENT CRIMES.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
AND THOSE PEOPLE CAN'T GET A
JOB, CAN'T GET A BUSINESS

00:03:41.553 --> 00:03:42.221 align:start position:0%
LICENSE.

00:03:42.254 --> 00:03:43.288
IN SOME STATES THEY CAN'T VOTE.

00:03:43.322 --> 00:03:47.426 align:start position:0%
THEY HAVE THEIR CITIZEN RIGHTS
RIPPED AWAY FROM THEM.

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.864
THIS IS A SYSTEM IF AMERICA'S
IN-CARERATION RATE WAS THE SAME

00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:53.032 align:start position:0%
AS OTHER COUNTRIES WE WOULD HAVE
20% LESS POVERTY.

00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:55.868 align:start position:0%
THESE ARE THE KIND OF
SELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS BY HAVING

00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:58.504 align:start position:0%
A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT TREATS
PEOPLE AFTER THEY GET SICK AS

00:03:58.537 --> 00:04:01.707
OPPOSED TO PREVENTSIVE CARE AND
WELLNESS AND EARLY INTERVENTION.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.779
WE SEEM TO BE A SOCIETY THAT
WANTS TO SAVE SO MUCH TAXPAYER

00:04:06.812 --> 00:04:10.516 align:start position:0%
DOLLARS AFTER PEOPLE ARE BROKEN
INSTEAD OF MAKING SMART,

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.818 align:start position:0%
STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS TO EMPOWER
OUR COUNTRY TO SUCCEED.

00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:16.822 align:start position:0%
AGAIN, THAT'S ANOTHER REASON I'M
FIGHTING TO LEAD THIS NATION.

00:04:16.855 --> 00:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Jon: SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR
BEING HERE.

00:04:20.192 --> 00:04:21.694
SENATOR CORY BOOKER, EVERYBODY.

00:04:21.727 --> 00:04:24.730 align:start position:0%
