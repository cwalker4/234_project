00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:04.824
- [Narrator] Yellow
Productions Presents...

00:00:04.824 --> 00:00:06.784
- The best cheap eats
on the Las Vegas strip

00:00:06.784 --> 00:00:08.214
in Las Vegas, Nevada.

00:00:08.214 --> 00:00:10.701
I'm Chris, this is my
traveling panda Topher,

00:00:10.701 --> 00:00:12.675
and in this video we're
going to be showing you

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:14.644
some of the best places
to eat in this city

00:00:14.644 --> 00:00:16.412
that won't break your wallet.

00:00:16.412 --> 00:00:18.089
By the way, we made Yellow Productions.

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:19.357
We do travel guides that are fun,

00:00:19.357 --> 00:00:21.037
informative, and entertaining.

00:00:21.037 --> 00:00:22.190
And if you're new here you might want

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.475
to consider subscribing
for new videos every week.

00:00:24.475 --> 00:00:26.172
But the first place
we're going to talk about

00:00:26.172 --> 00:00:28.902
that is cheap and great is right here,

00:00:28.902 --> 00:00:30.401
In-N-Out Burger.

00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:32.300
In-N-Out Burger recently opened a location

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.935
in the Las Vegas strip.

00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:36.007
It is in the Linq Plaza.

00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:39.467
Th Linq is the plaza that has
the really big Ferris wheel.

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:43.128
In-N-Out Burger is a California icon.

00:00:43.128 --> 00:00:45.457
Previously, they hadn't
had any on the strip.

00:00:45.457 --> 00:00:48.171
I really love the double double.

00:00:48.171 --> 00:00:50.540
It's a double cheeseburger,
fries, and drink

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.403
for like seven bucks, super cheap.

00:00:52.403 --> 00:00:53.724
They've also got a store out in front

00:00:53.724 --> 00:00:55.582
where you can get the company merchandise.

00:00:55.582 --> 00:00:58.820
Als, in the Linq, if I
pan over here to the left,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.800
another place from LA,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.223
there's a place right
here called Sprinkles.

00:01:03.223 --> 00:01:05.564
Sprinkles is famous for its cupcakes.

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:09.588
They are kinda who made the
red velvet cupcakes famous.

00:01:09.588 --> 00:01:12.114
The cupcakes are about $3.50,

00:01:12.114 --> 00:01:13.827
but some of the cheapest dessert

00:01:13.827 --> 00:01:16.079
that you're gonna find on
the Las Vegas strip, too.

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:17.535
In addition to cupcakes,
they have an ice cream place.

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:21.618
You can get a Sprinkles
cupcake ice cream Sundae,

00:01:22.895 --> 00:01:24.884
where they take the cupcake
and they cut it in half

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:26.623
and they put ice cream in the middle.

00:01:26.623 --> 00:01:27.666
Super delicious.

00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:29.047
Give it a try when you're on the strip.

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:31.631
For the rest of this video, I'm
not gonna go from the middle

00:01:31.631 --> 00:01:33.823
or in a particular order
from best to worst,

00:01:33.823 --> 00:01:35.350
but the order I'm gonna go in

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.805
is starting from the sort of Mandalay Bay

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:41.677
side of the strip, then down
to the Circus Circus side.

00:01:41.677 --> 00:01:42.913
So that's how we're gonna work it.

00:01:42.913 --> 00:01:45.251
All right, so I'll see you at the place

00:01:45.251 --> 00:01:47.563
closest to the Mandalay Bay.

00:01:47.563 --> 00:01:49.655
The second best hamburger in Las Vegas

00:01:49.655 --> 00:01:51.957
is at Shake Shake.

00:01:51.957 --> 00:01:53.900
This is a chain from New York,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.204
and it is in the NYNY Hotel
right in the Las Vegas strip.

00:01:58.204 --> 00:02:00.119
They're famous for their Shack burger.

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.783
I also like this place because

00:02:01.783 --> 00:02:03.477
you can get cheese with the fries.

00:02:03.477 --> 00:02:05.297
But being called Shake Shake,

00:02:05.297 --> 00:02:07.459
they are famous for their shakes.

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.857
The seasonal shake today
was the red velvet shake,

00:02:11.857 --> 00:02:12.690
and mmm.

00:02:14.686 --> 00:02:18.103
It is a vanilla custard shake with actual

00:02:19.256 --> 00:02:22.756
real bits of red velvet cake inside of it.

00:02:24.337 --> 00:02:25.837
It is pretty good.

00:02:27.563 --> 00:02:30.060
That shake is very rich.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.086
And the double shack
burger, two pieces of meat,

00:02:34.086 --> 00:02:36.029
lettuce, tomato, let's go ahead

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:39.196
and dive into this, looks pretty good.

00:02:40.228 --> 00:02:41.061
Mmm.

00:02:45.951 --> 00:02:47.174
That's a good burger.

00:02:47.174 --> 00:02:48.919
Now, I'm partial to In-N-Out Burger.

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:50.732
That's being a California native,

00:02:50.732 --> 00:02:53.133
I love it in the appropriate shirt,

00:02:53.133 --> 00:02:54.562
I bought it at the company store

00:02:54.562 --> 00:02:55.720
that you just saw previously.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.811
But the Shack burger, really good meat.

00:02:57.811 --> 00:02:59.038
Really juicy.

00:02:59.038 --> 00:03:01.304
More meat than on the In-N-Out burger,

00:03:01.304 --> 00:03:03.590
and a nice soft bun.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.732
People who love the Shake
Shack say their favorite

00:03:06.732 --> 00:03:10.065
things about is is the meat and the bun.

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:14.974
They have these waffle
cut fries, cheese sauce.

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:19.062
Pretty darn good.

00:03:19.062 --> 00:03:22.395
Not as cheap is Shake Shack as In-N-Out.

00:03:24.688 --> 00:03:26.601
The burger, $8.00.

00:03:26.601 --> 00:03:30.101
The french fries with cheese sauce, $4.00.

00:03:33.023 --> 00:03:35.356
The red velvet shake, $5.00.

00:03:37.893 --> 00:03:41.143
And the iced tea was about three bucks.

00:03:43.372 --> 00:03:47.509
All in total, $23.00 for
the shake shack meal,

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:49.485
but still cheap compared to
a lot of the other things

00:03:49.485 --> 00:03:51.402
on the Las Vegas strip.

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:55.844
While you're at the NYNY, a
couple other cheap eats inside.

00:03:55.844 --> 00:03:59.142
There's a Jewish deli,
a New York Jewish deli,

00:03:59.142 --> 00:04:02.123
that have really good pastrami sandwiches.

00:04:02.123 --> 00:04:04.321
I think it's about 10 bucks
for the pastrami sandwich.

00:04:04.321 --> 00:04:06.329
One of my favorite things to eat here,

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.223
the pastrami, super juicy and tender.

00:04:09.223 --> 00:04:11.829
Comes on rye bread, mustard,
served with a pickle.

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.312
They also either have chicken
noodle or matzah ball soup.

00:04:14.312 --> 00:04:17.562
If you're not in the mood for pastrami,

00:04:19.624 --> 00:04:22.213
then you can head to the pizza restaurant

00:04:22.213 --> 00:04:23.332
just around the corner.

00:04:23.332 --> 00:04:25.033
Some of my favorite pizza in Las Vegas

00:04:25.033 --> 00:04:27.073
is located just inside the NYNY hotel.

00:04:27.073 --> 00:04:29.360
It's from Sirroco's Pizza.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.573
And they've got the regular
New York style pizza,

00:04:32.573 --> 00:04:36.884
but they've also got the
square pan Sicilian style pizza

00:04:36.884 --> 00:04:39.475
with the sausage that's New York style.

00:04:39.475 --> 00:04:42.887
Not little balls, but kinda
cut up like pepperoni.

00:04:42.887 --> 00:04:46.387
Get the chili pepper and garlic salt, mmm.

00:04:48.703 --> 00:04:52.336
Really good pizza, really good taste.

00:04:52.336 --> 00:04:54.768
And then just next to the NYNY Hotel,

00:04:54.768 --> 00:04:58.124
in the new, they call it like the park,

00:04:58.124 --> 00:05:00.417
it's the new T-Mobile arena,

00:05:00.417 --> 00:05:03.142
there's an outlet of
the chain called Bruxie.

00:05:03.142 --> 00:05:06.773
Bruxie specializes in waffle sandwiches.

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:09.368
They actually started up in Orange County

00:05:09.368 --> 00:05:11.260
in the city of Orange.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.908
But this Bruxie is a good
representative of their chain,

00:05:15.908 --> 00:05:18.184
and you should check out, their
probably most famous thing

00:05:18.184 --> 00:05:21.641
is the fried chicken and waffle sandwich.

00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:24.455
Get it with the maple syrup,

00:05:24.455 --> 00:05:26.435
you'll really thank me for it later.

00:05:26.435 --> 00:05:28.252
They also have really good shakes

00:05:28.252 --> 00:05:30.907
and really good custard ice
cream over there as well.

00:05:30.907 --> 00:05:33.172
And dessert waffle sandwiches too.

00:05:33.172 --> 00:05:34.847
Across the street from
the Monte Carlo Hotel,

00:05:34.847 --> 00:05:37.448
check out the newly opened
Boulevard Food Court.

00:05:37.448 --> 00:05:40.031
Yes, there's pizza in here too,

00:05:42.065 --> 00:05:43.005
but the most promising and tasty place

00:05:43.005 --> 00:05:45.621
looks to be El Dorado
express Mexican street tacos

00:05:45.621 --> 00:05:46.952
for about three bucks each,

00:05:46.952 --> 00:05:49.387
specializing in the Al Pastor.

00:05:49.387 --> 00:05:52.637
Got the pork rotating here and cooking.

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:57.482
Looks pretty good, and they are open 24/7.

00:05:57.482 --> 00:05:58.994
Another one of my must eats

00:05:58.994 --> 00:06:01.174
when I'm at Las Vegas on the strip

00:06:01.174 --> 00:06:03.536
is at Jean Phillippe Patisserie.

00:06:03.536 --> 00:06:05.867
They have delicious deserts.

00:06:05.867 --> 00:06:07.111
This is a raspberry tart.

00:06:07.111 --> 00:06:09.474
It's $8.00, while not super super cheap,

00:06:09.474 --> 00:06:11.383
I think it's a great value for what it is.

00:06:11.383 --> 00:06:14.319
They have sandwiches, they have danishes.

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:17.453
This is what it's called,
Jean Phillippe Patisserie.

00:06:17.453 --> 00:06:18.460
They have two locations.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.761
One, that I'm at right here,
it's in the Aria Hotel.

00:06:20.761 --> 00:06:23.929
And I like this one the
best because it has kinda

00:06:23.929 --> 00:06:27.598
the most seating and it's
usually the least crowded.

00:06:27.598 --> 00:06:30.878
I also really enjoy their utensils.

00:06:30.878 --> 00:06:33.211
These, they look like
they're metal, don't they?

00:06:33.211 --> 00:06:35.074
But they're actually plastic.

00:06:35.074 --> 00:06:36.561
Interesting.

00:06:36.561 --> 00:06:38.563
And of course, because
I'm a little kid at heart,

00:06:38.563 --> 00:06:42.730
in addition to my raspberry
tart, I get a cup of milk.

00:06:44.902 --> 00:06:46.169
I usually stop at Jean Phillippe,

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:48.951
not just once on a trip,
but multiple times.

00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:50.612
So this is my first one on this trip,

00:06:50.612 --> 00:06:52.294
but I'll probably be eating at the one

00:06:52.294 --> 00:06:53.599
at the Bellagio, too, just
for completeness sake.

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:55.885
Continuing the pizza trend,

00:06:55.885 --> 00:06:56.718
there's a pretty good cheap pizza place

00:06:56.718 --> 00:06:58.551
inside the Aria hotel.

00:06:59.831 --> 00:07:02.060
It's the Five 50 Pizza Bar.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.265
They've got $6.00 or
$7.00 slices of pizza.

00:07:04.265 --> 00:07:06.794
My favorite is the Gotham pizza.

00:07:06.794 --> 00:07:08.125
It's basically a meat lover's pizza,

00:07:08.125 --> 00:07:10.938
and it's cool because the pizzas are fired

00:07:10.938 --> 00:07:13.712
in the wood burning oven.

00:07:13.712 --> 00:07:17.233
The Cosmopolitan Hotel has
two solid cheap eats options.

00:07:17.233 --> 00:07:20.246
The first one is Eggslut,
it's up on the second floor.

00:07:20.246 --> 00:07:24.080
They specialize in bacon,
egg, and cheese sandwiches.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.590
They've also got this
thing called the slut,

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.109
which is an egg cooked
in this little glass jar.

00:07:29.109 --> 00:07:30.311
Eight bucks will get you the sandwich,

00:07:30.311 --> 00:07:32.724
pretty cheap and tasty.

00:07:32.724 --> 00:07:34.832
They're open until 7:00pm.

00:07:34.832 --> 00:07:36.826
Get there early but not too early,

00:07:36.826 --> 00:07:40.555
because they can have 30
minute waits at breakfast time.

00:07:40.555 --> 00:07:44.146
And on the third floor,
just down this hallway

00:07:44.146 --> 00:07:46.552
next to the Blue Ribbon and the elevator,

00:07:46.552 --> 00:07:48.809
is this place called Secret Pizza.

00:07:48.809 --> 00:07:51.684
It's a secret because you
won't find it on any maps,

00:07:51.684 --> 00:07:53.561
and there's no sign.

00:07:53.561 --> 00:07:56.683
But they've got pretty tasty $6.00 pizza,

00:07:56.683 --> 00:07:59.592
and you can eat it back out in the lobby

00:07:59.592 --> 00:08:01.345
right in front of the hallway.

00:08:01.345 --> 00:08:03.000
My favorite cheap and tasty sandwich place

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.672
on the Las Vegas strip
is the Earl of Sandwich.

00:08:05.672 --> 00:08:07.157
They've got three locations.

00:08:07.157 --> 00:08:10.198
Planet Hollywood, Caesar's
Palace, and at The Palms.

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:12.886
I like the one in Planet
Hollywood the best.

00:08:12.886 --> 00:08:14.564
It's cheaper than the
one at Caesar's Palace,

00:08:14.564 --> 00:08:16.770
and they have a really good seating area.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.810
The sandwiches are about $6.00 or $7.00.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.374
They come wrapped up in
these little gold packages.

00:08:21.374 --> 00:08:22.934
There's two that I like.

00:08:22.934 --> 00:08:25.479
I like the Earl's club, so I'll go ahead

00:08:25.479 --> 00:08:27.767
and unwrap this and
show you this one first.

00:08:27.767 --> 00:08:29.549
What's really great about
all their sandwiches

00:08:29.549 --> 00:08:33.497
is that they're all
hot, toasted sandwiches.

00:08:33.497 --> 00:08:35.290
Look see, so you can see this.

00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:38.265
And they're not super big,
but they're warm, fresh.

00:08:38.265 --> 00:08:40.417
I think the bread makes
them really delicious.

00:08:40.417 --> 00:08:41.764
This is the club.

00:08:41.764 --> 00:08:45.097
It's got lettuce, tomato, turkey, bacon,

00:08:46.552 --> 00:08:49.187
and some of their really good kind of like

00:08:49.187 --> 00:08:51.729
thousand island-ish dressing.

00:08:51.729 --> 00:08:52.819
Mmm.

00:08:52.819 --> 00:08:53.736
Super good.

00:08:55.345 --> 00:08:56.678
Super flavorful.

00:08:59.648 --> 00:09:01.591
And I also like a sandwich that they call

00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:04.538
the holiday turkey sandwich.

00:09:04.538 --> 00:09:06.412
This sandwich has turkey, stuffing,

00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:08.079
and cranberry sauce.

00:09:09.064 --> 00:09:10.633
Now, if you wonder,

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:13.410
is Chris really gonna eat two sandwiches?

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.177
The answer is that I love these sandwiches

00:09:15.177 --> 00:09:16.574
so much that I will.

00:09:16.574 --> 00:09:20.006
And they often have coupons
in the local magazines,

00:09:20.006 --> 00:09:23.143
the local tourist magazines,
and if you pick it up...

00:09:23.143 --> 00:09:25.347
I have a coupon, it was
two for one sandwiches,

00:09:25.347 --> 00:09:27.423
buy one get one free.

00:09:27.423 --> 00:09:31.266
So for $12 I got a drink, barbecue chips,

00:09:31.266 --> 00:09:32.849
and two sandwiches.

00:09:34.025 --> 00:09:35.953
This is probably the
cheapest and tastiest thing

00:09:35.953 --> 00:09:37.903
you're gonna eat on the Las Vegas strip.

00:09:37.903 --> 00:09:39.478
Definitely check it out
in Planet Hollywood.

00:09:39.478 --> 00:09:42.022
It's just inside from
two other cheap places

00:09:42.022 --> 00:09:44.022
that are on the outside.

00:09:45.177 --> 00:09:47.517
Pink's Hot Dogs and Pin-Up Pizza.

00:09:47.517 --> 00:09:49.358
Pin-Up Pizza sells these really cheap,

00:09:49.358 --> 00:09:50.662
big slices of pizza.

00:09:50.662 --> 00:09:53.126
Pink's Hot Dogs, a chain from LA,

00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:55.096
sells hot dogs.

00:09:55.096 --> 00:09:57.519
They've got lots of
different styles of hot dogs.

00:09:57.519 --> 00:10:00.647
Their hot dogs start at about $4.50,

00:10:00.647 --> 00:10:02.547
but go up from there
depending on how fancy

00:10:02.547 --> 00:10:04.710
of a hot dog you get.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.927
They're famous, probably,
for their chili dogs.

00:10:07.927 --> 00:10:08.962
So if you're gonna go to Pink's,

00:10:08.962 --> 00:10:12.166
make sure you get one
that has chili on it.

00:10:12.166 --> 00:10:14.286
Another one of my favorite
bakeries on the Las Vegas strip

00:10:14.286 --> 00:10:17.876
is Paris Baguette, located
inside the Venetian Hotel

00:10:17.876 --> 00:10:20.203
in St. Mark's Square.

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:22.222
It's very interested
because it's a French bakery

00:10:22.222 --> 00:10:26.389
in a Italian themed hotel,
owned by a Korean company.

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.194
But they make some pretty good pastries.

00:10:29.194 --> 00:10:31.014
My favorites, the strawberry ones.

00:10:31.014 --> 00:10:32.536
I got the strawberry tart.

00:10:32.536 --> 00:10:35.122
Seven bucks, a little
pile of strawberry heaven.

00:10:35.122 --> 00:10:37.625
In addition to cakes and things like that,

00:10:37.625 --> 00:10:40.083
they've got more bread type pastries,

00:10:40.083 --> 00:10:41.666
and sandwiches too.

00:10:42.628 --> 00:10:43.969
Inside the Fashion Show Mall,

00:10:43.969 --> 00:10:45.920
Las Vegas' biggest shopping center,

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.871
is a cornucopia of cheap eats.

00:10:47.871 --> 00:10:49.950
Up on the third floor is the food court,

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.397
with about 13 different
cheap eats choices.

00:10:52.397 --> 00:10:55.732
But I think the best one,
if you're gonna eat up here,

00:10:55.732 --> 00:10:57.904
is The Habit, another burger
chain from California.

00:10:57.904 --> 00:11:01.441
The Habit started in Santa Barbara.

00:11:01.441 --> 00:11:03.015
I really enjoy The Habit.

00:11:03.015 --> 00:11:05.265
Their meat is char-grilled,

00:11:06.891 --> 00:11:09.484
so it has a nice char-y taste on it,

00:11:09.484 --> 00:11:11.815
and get these Santa Barbara style.

00:11:11.815 --> 00:11:15.494
It comes on grilled sourdough
bread with avocado as well.

00:11:15.494 --> 00:11:18.229
Located out in front of the shopping mall

00:11:18.229 --> 00:11:20.411
is Luke's Lobster.

00:11:20.411 --> 00:11:22.402
They specialize in lobster rolls,

00:11:22.402 --> 00:11:24.925
and while the lobster
rolls are never cheap,

00:11:24.925 --> 00:11:26.728
they're $17.00 for the lobster roll,

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:29.977
they have a cheap, $10 shrimp roll.

00:11:29.977 --> 00:11:34.289
They've also got clam
chowder, grilled cheese,

00:11:34.289 --> 00:11:35.402
and they got a few seats in the back

00:11:35.402 --> 00:11:36.495
of this little shack.

00:11:36.495 --> 00:11:39.464
If you're craving some
authentic Tijuana style tacos,

00:11:39.464 --> 00:11:41.218
just at the foot of the Encore Hotel,

00:11:41.218 --> 00:11:42.859
check out Tacos El Gordo,

00:11:42.859 --> 00:11:45.702
a taco chain straight
from Tijuana, Mexico.

00:11:45.702 --> 00:11:48.194
The line out the door can't be wrong.

00:11:48.194 --> 00:11:50.629
Tacos here, about $2.50.

00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:53.067
Super tasty, kinda greasy.

00:11:53.067 --> 00:11:56.356
One of their specialties
is Tacos Al Pastor.

00:11:56.356 --> 00:11:58.416
It's made of meat cooked
on this rotating spit

00:11:58.416 --> 00:12:00.358
kind of like Greek Gyros.

00:12:00.358 --> 00:12:02.637
Pretty delicious, definitely
get the Tacos Al Pastor

00:12:02.637 --> 00:12:04.395
if you come to Tacos El Gordo.

00:12:04.395 --> 00:12:06.039
Finally, on the north end of the strip,

00:12:06.039 --> 00:12:08.831
just across from Circus
Circus, is the Peppermill,

00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:12.125
a 24/7 classic Las Vegas diner

00:12:12.125 --> 00:12:15.359
selling breakfast 24 hours a day,

00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:18.747
this place is about as
Vegas as Vegas gets.

00:12:18.747 --> 00:12:20.589
So if you want to
experience classic Vegas,

00:12:20.589 --> 00:12:21.661
check it out.

00:12:21.661 --> 00:12:25.828
Even their advertising
says, classic Vegas dining.

00:12:26.876 --> 00:12:28.417
If you're not in the mood for food,

00:12:28.417 --> 00:12:30.700
but you are for drinks,
check out their retro lounge,

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.903
the Fireside Lounge in the back.

00:12:32.903 --> 00:12:34.903
No windows, truly Vegas.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:37.898
Thanks for watching.

Bye-Bye.
