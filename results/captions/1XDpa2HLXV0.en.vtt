00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.130
Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote:

00:00:09.763 --> 00:00:13.303
"If there is any period
one would desire to be born in,

00:00:13.654 --> 00:00:16.034
is it not the age of revolution;

00:00:16.355 --> 00:00:18.905
when the old and the new
stand side by side

00:00:18.905 --> 00:00:20.655
and admit of being compared;

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.270
when the energies of all men
are searched by fear and by hope;

00:00:25.704 --> 00:00:29.329
when the historic glories of the old
can be compensated

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.124
by the rich possibilities of the new era?

00:00:32.584 --> 00:00:36.872
This time, like all times,
is a very good one

00:00:36.872 --> 00:00:39.521
if we know what to do with it."

00:00:40.751 --> 00:00:42.651
If we know what to do with it.

00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:48.581
Which reminds me of a story that happened
17-and-a-half years ago for me.

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:53.095
I lived in Sydney, Australia,
and I just started a new job.

00:00:53.558 --> 00:00:55.713
I was asked to go
to a national sales meeting

00:00:55.713 --> 00:00:58.638
because I was the general
manager of the operation,

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:02.758
and I learned that
the national sales meeting

00:01:02.758 --> 00:01:06.538
was actually on the date
that my wife was due to have our child.

00:01:07.637 --> 00:01:10.107
So I was very concerned,
I went home and told her,

00:01:10.107 --> 00:01:13.807
"Look, first children are never
born on their due date.

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:16.217
(Laughter)

00:01:16.217 --> 00:01:19.737
So I'm going to be gone just one night,
and I'm going to Cairns, Australia,

00:01:19.737 --> 00:01:22.877
and I'm going to be there for one night -
I have to give a speech -

00:01:22.877 --> 00:01:25.467
and I'm going come back,
and everything will be fine,

00:01:25.467 --> 00:01:27.337
and very likely, as the doctor told us,

00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:30.157
you're not going to have the baby
for about two more weeks."

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:33.667
I went up there, and I was still
negotiating the bonus plan for the year,

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:37.877
so I was talking with my new boss,
who is a Swiss gentleman named Rodo.

00:01:37.877 --> 00:01:40.567
And Rodo had this very,
very heavy thick Swiss accent,

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:42.577
and he always smoked cigarettes.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.400
And we're going through
this tough negotiation,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.435
and right in the middle
of the negotiation,

00:01:47.435 --> 00:01:50.287
at 11:45 at night, as we sat in the bar,

00:01:51.057 --> 00:01:52.340
the phone rings.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.850
That's my wife ...

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.260
And I said, "Is everything okay?"

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.740
She said, "I just had my water break."

00:02:02.292 --> 00:02:04.042
And I thought, "Oh no."

00:02:04.042 --> 00:02:05.062
I'm in Cairns.

00:02:05.062 --> 00:02:08.902
There's no way that I'm going to be able
to get back down to Sydney

00:02:08.902 --> 00:02:10.452
in that amount of time,

00:02:10.452 --> 00:02:13.762
because the doctors always say
it's about four hours to make it

00:02:13.762 --> 00:02:16.452
from the time the water breaks
until the baby comes.

00:02:16.798 --> 00:02:19.803
So I went to my boss -
I knew he had a plane -

00:02:19.803 --> 00:02:24.148
and I said, "Is there some way
you can fly me down to Sydney tonight,

00:02:24.148 --> 00:02:26.153
because my wife has just gone into labor."

00:02:26.153 --> 00:02:29.203
He said, while he smoked his cigarette,

00:02:29.203 --> 00:02:30.868
(Inhales)

00:02:30.868 --> 00:02:32.503
"Give me ten minutes."

00:02:32.503 --> 00:02:34.813
(Laughter)

00:02:34.813 --> 00:02:36.933
"I'll prepare a flight plan
and we will go."

00:02:36.933 --> 00:02:39.653
So I run back to my room;
I take everything off of my bed;

00:02:39.653 --> 00:02:41.173
I threw it in a suitcase -

00:02:41.173 --> 00:02:43.173
I remember I still have the remote control

00:02:43.173 --> 00:02:45.373
that actually went flying
into my suitcase -

00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:50.251
and I ran downstairs, I'm standing
by the elevator waiting for him,

00:02:50.251 --> 00:02:51.731
and about twenty minutes later,

00:02:51.731 --> 00:02:55.976
he finally leisurely walks out
of the elevator, looks at me and says,

00:02:55.976 --> 00:02:58.881
"Can you believe
I lost the key to my airplane?"

00:02:58.881 --> 00:03:01.121
(Laughter)

00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:03.198
So we run, literally run.

00:03:03.198 --> 00:03:07.047
We get in a taxi, we go to the airport,
and I learn then that the airport lights -

00:03:07.047 --> 00:03:08.652
this is in Port Douglas -

00:03:08.652 --> 00:03:11.667
turn on when you actually have
a radio button inside the plane.

00:03:11.667 --> 00:03:14.357
So you hit the button,
the lights turn on, and he says,

00:03:14.357 --> 00:03:17.167
"I need you to check the wing, 
I need you to check the oil,

00:03:17.167 --> 00:03:19.117
check the condensation," and I'm like,

00:03:19.117 --> 00:03:22.387
"I don't know anything about this stuff.
Are you kidding me?"

00:03:22.797 --> 00:03:25.127
So I was really afraid.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.980
The people that work with me know
that when I get afraid or stressed,

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.540
my heart rate really drops,
my blood pressure drops,

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.190
I kind of have an opposite effect.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.927
And in all my companies, 
my management teams know this,

00:03:37.927 --> 00:03:42.317
so when things get really rough and tough,
because I kind of lead turnarounds,

00:03:42.317 --> 00:03:44.287
they usually buy me a pillow

00:03:44.287 --> 00:03:46.197
because I fall asleep.

00:03:46.607 --> 00:03:47.567
(Laughter)

00:03:47.567 --> 00:03:50.107
So we get in the plane,
we take off, and I'm thinking,

00:03:50.107 --> 00:03:53.517
"I've got to make it to the birth,
I've got to make it to the birth,"

00:03:54.407 --> 00:03:56.727
and I completely fall asleep.

00:03:56.727 --> 00:03:57.767
(Laughter)

00:03:57.767 --> 00:04:00.547
And I'm in the cockpit; I'm the co-pilot!

00:04:01.142 --> 00:04:02.534
So we're up in the sky.

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:04.417
All of a sudden, we're bouncing around.

00:04:04.417 --> 00:04:06.462
I wake up, and I look at the dashboard,

00:04:06.462 --> 00:04:08.527
where everything
had been well lit before,

00:04:08.527 --> 00:04:10.647
and now it's completely black.

00:04:11.508 --> 00:04:15.108
He says to me, "Robert,
can you see the coastline?"

00:04:17.334 --> 00:04:20.814
And I said, "No, there's too many clouds."

00:04:20.814 --> 00:04:26.354
He says - he's talking, it's really loud,
it's a prop plane, it's Piper Cup,

00:04:27.814 --> 00:04:30.534
and he says, "Are you sure
you cannot see the coastline?"

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:33.818
And I said, "Yeah."

00:04:34.335 --> 00:04:37.845
And he says, "To add
to the drama of the situation ...

00:04:37.845 --> 00:04:40.335
(Laughter)

00:04:41.616 --> 00:04:45.535
all of our navigation
and instrumentation is inoperative.

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.635
Can you see the coastline?"

00:04:47.635 --> 00:04:49.955
(Laughter)

00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:57.031
So, they actually have to close down
Sydney International Airport to find us.

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.929
We had flown off-course
towards New Zealand -

00:04:59.929 --> 00:05:02.481
that's why he was asking
about the coastline.

00:05:02.481 --> 00:05:05.491
We only had enough fuel
to make it to Sydney,

00:05:05.491 --> 00:05:07.102
and now I was really,

00:05:07.102 --> 00:05:09.893
"I've got to make it
to my daughter's birth,"

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:12.453
and now I'm thinking:
"I've just got to make it."

00:05:12.453 --> 00:05:13.903
(Laughter)

00:05:14.803 --> 00:05:19.537
So finally, we come into Sydney,
and we land the plane.

00:05:19.537 --> 00:05:21.416
I rush to the hospital.

00:05:21.426 --> 00:05:25.096
We land at 3:07, and it takes 30 minutes
to get to Baulkham Hills Hospital,

00:05:25.096 --> 00:05:26.742
and I'm going as fast as I can.

00:05:26.742 --> 00:05:29.806
I make it there, I rush
through the labor ward doors,

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:34.744
and just as I run into the room
where my wife was having our daughter,

00:05:35.184 --> 00:05:37.682
the doctor and nurses say "He made it!"

00:05:37.682 --> 00:05:40.524
and I see my daughter's head,
just barely crowning,

00:05:40.524 --> 00:05:42.882
and one minute later, she was born.

00:05:45.313 --> 00:05:48.718
(Applause)

00:05:49.735 --> 00:05:52.567
Now, of course, I got to hold her

00:05:52.967 --> 00:05:54.339
at that moment,

00:05:54.739 --> 00:05:58.278
and it was the most awe-inspiring
moment of my entire life.

00:06:00.248 --> 00:06:04.357
I remember thinking,
"This time is a very good one."

00:06:05.597 --> 00:06:08.476
But my thoughts are searched
by fear and by hope.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.726
Will I be a great father?

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.953
Those of us that have had children 
know this feeling.

00:06:16.568 --> 00:06:19.016
Will I be able to take on
this responsibility?

00:06:19.426 --> 00:06:22.219
Will she be the daughter
that I aspire her to be?

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:24.351
Will I be that father to her as well?

00:06:25.805 --> 00:06:28.702
Very often, we all get caught
in moments of fear.

00:06:29.402 --> 00:06:32.032
Alexander the Great once said,

00:06:32.032 --> 00:06:35.242
"Man's immortality is not living forever.

00:06:37.042 --> 00:06:41.177
Every moment free from fear 
makes man immortal."

00:06:42.609 --> 00:06:47.370
Man's immortality is not living forever
because that desire is born of fear!

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.855
Every moment free from fear
makes man immortal.

00:06:52.168 --> 00:06:56.847
When you break yourself of fear, 
your thoughts go on forever.

00:06:57.982 --> 00:06:59.306
But how do you do it?

00:06:59.306 --> 00:07:02.605
Because all of us start to think
in terms of scarcity.

00:07:02.605 --> 00:07:05.148
Some of us actually make it
to terms of abundance.

00:07:05.832 --> 00:07:07.655
Harvard Business School

00:07:07.655 --> 00:07:09.919
asked their students
when they were graduating,

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:12.777
"What would you rather have
when you graduate, for a salary?"

00:07:12.777 --> 00:07:19.714
Scenario A, and all dollars are constant,
is you make $160,000 upon graduation,

00:07:19.966 --> 00:07:24.138
and the rest of the students
in the cohort, on average, get $150,000.

00:07:24.908 --> 00:07:28.656
Scenario B is you make $200,000,

00:07:29.813 --> 00:07:33.202
and the rest of the students,
on average, get $220,000.

00:07:33.202 --> 00:07:34.923
What do you think they chose?

00:07:37.036 --> 00:07:39.792
87% chose A!

00:07:40.655 --> 00:07:43.974
Now, you would think these are
some of the smartest kids in the world.

00:07:43.974 --> 00:07:45.024
(Laughter)

00:07:45.024 --> 00:07:45.984
Right?

00:07:46.176 --> 00:07:47.804
You would think they're brilliant;

00:07:47.804 --> 00:07:50.350
they're going to Harvard,
they've learned about money,

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.767
and yet they chose the lesser economics.

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:59.120
Because they're more focused
on "having versus having not."

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:05.028
They're more focused in terms of
"your win is my loss" and vise versa.

00:08:05.523 --> 00:08:09.438
When actually, abundance
changes everything.

00:08:09.718 --> 00:08:12.115
Abundance comes
from a place of confidence;

00:08:12.115 --> 00:08:14.581
scarcity comes from a place of fear.

00:08:15.299 --> 00:08:18.670
Breaking yourself of that type of thinking

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.094
will change your life
and change your world.

00:08:22.618 --> 00:08:26.677
In life, we don't get
what we deserve, all the time.

00:08:27.777 --> 00:08:29.625
We get what we expect.

00:08:30.293 --> 00:08:34.347
Researchers went to a first-grade class,
and they tested all the students,

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:35.783
did an IQ test.

00:08:36.134 --> 00:08:38.740
In that IQ test, the asked everybody -

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:39.998
They told the teacher,

00:08:39.998 --> 00:08:43.196
"You're not allowed to talk
to the students or parents about this.

00:08:43.196 --> 00:08:45.031
We're going to observe you for a year,

00:08:45.031 --> 00:08:47.634
and you have to sign
a contract of confidentiality

00:08:47.634 --> 00:08:49.418
on who gets the highest scores."

00:08:49.715 --> 00:08:51.246
Of the 30 students tested,

00:08:51.246 --> 00:08:55.407
five got genius level:
more than 140 IQ scores.

00:08:56.002 --> 00:08:57.328
Five students.

00:08:57.328 --> 00:09:00.378
So for the course of the next year, 
they monitored the class.

00:09:00.378 --> 00:09:02.120
They monitored the teacher.

00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:05.564
At the end of the year, they came back
and tested all the students

00:09:05.564 --> 00:09:09.326
to see if there were any variations
or differences in the outcomes.

00:09:09.326 --> 00:09:11.658
Who do you think
got the five highest scores?

00:09:12.138 --> 00:09:13.941
The five genius students!

00:09:14.099 --> 00:09:15.504
No great surprise.

00:09:15.666 --> 00:09:20.129
Except that that wasn't the true nature
and subject of the research.

00:09:21.078 --> 00:09:24.552
The true subject of the research
was that they lied to the teacher.

00:09:25.393 --> 00:09:29.168
None of the students, the year before,
had actually been tested as gifted.

00:09:31.139 --> 00:09:36.237
Her expectation that those five students,
at a subconscious level -

00:09:36.237 --> 00:09:38.995
and she really did follow the rules -

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:42.781
led those five students
to get the highest scores.

00:09:46.254 --> 00:09:48.558
Two ways to overcome fear -

00:09:49.268 --> 00:09:51.949
and these are from my personal
experience in life,

00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:55.998
so this is not anything more
than just philosophy of Robert.

00:09:56.931 --> 00:09:59.043
One is: gratitude.

00:09:59.443 --> 00:10:05.101
I found it impossible to be fearful
and grateful at the same time.

00:10:06.471 --> 00:10:10.273
If I let my mind stop for a moment
and feel gratitude -

00:10:10.273 --> 00:10:13.101
even in moments
of despair and difficulty -

00:10:13.101 --> 00:10:15.495
it makes all the difference in my life.

00:10:16.746 --> 00:10:20.119
The next way to overcome fear
that I found, personally,

00:10:21.159 --> 00:10:24.658
is to be intentional in my decisions.

00:10:25.737 --> 00:10:27.274
Everything that happens to you

00:10:27.274 --> 00:10:29.842
can either be the best thing
that ever happened to you,

00:10:29.842 --> 00:10:31.425
or it could be the worst.

00:10:31.836 --> 00:10:34.087
It's about your perception of that.

00:10:35.026 --> 00:10:39.217
About 18 months ago, I had a terrible,
humiliating experience in my life.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.654
I had left a wonderful job
two years before,

00:10:43.654 --> 00:10:46.629
and I left because I was
recruited by Warburg Pincus,

00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:48.298
a very large private equity fund,

00:10:48.808 --> 00:10:50.761
to become CEO of Bausch + Lomb Surgical.

00:10:50.761 --> 00:10:53.516
The intent was to spin out that business,

00:10:54.226 --> 00:10:59.006
and to take that as a separate business
and try to derive value from it.

00:10:59.006 --> 00:11:01.006
It was a dog of a business at the time;

00:11:01.006 --> 00:11:03.235
it wasn't performing very well at all.

00:11:03.454 --> 00:11:07.287
During the course of the next year,
we changed the metrics of the business.

00:11:07.287 --> 00:11:08.485
It succeeded.

00:11:08.486 --> 00:11:09.872
We did really well.

00:11:11.166 --> 00:11:15.470
After a year and a half, I was ready.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:16.428
"Okay.

00:11:16.428 --> 00:11:17.693
The company's doing great,

00:11:17.693 --> 00:11:20.528
employee's willingness-to-recommend
scores are really high,

00:11:20.528 --> 00:11:24.728
all of our scores across customer
willingness-to-recommend are really high.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.445
It's time."

00:11:26.917 --> 00:11:30.093
Because we started doing so well
and forecasted great growth,

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.892
the parent decided they
weren't going to spin off the business

00:11:33.892 --> 00:11:37.099
and that they could derive greater value
by selling it to one party.

00:11:37.099 --> 00:11:38.364
The entire company.

00:11:38.798 --> 00:11:42.813
My hopes were dashed. I was broken.

00:11:43.329 --> 00:11:47.033
That night, I flew home
from New York City, very broken;

00:11:47.208 --> 00:11:49.317
I actually threw up on the airplane.

00:11:52.095 --> 00:11:55.080
The next morning, I woke up,
and I remember thinking,

00:11:55.592 --> 00:11:58.765
"Today can be the worst day of my life,
or it can be the best.

00:11:59.634 --> 00:12:00.893
It's up to me."

00:12:02.288 --> 00:12:04.434
I decided that it
was going to be the best.

00:12:05.044 --> 00:12:07.459
Later that day, I had an idea

00:12:07.459 --> 00:12:11.659
to create the first Medicare opt-out
company in all of healthcare.

00:12:12.709 --> 00:12:15.644
The first company that takes 
no money from the government.

00:12:16.405 --> 00:12:19.543
I didn't realize
how big of an idea that could be.

00:12:19.774 --> 00:12:23.208
It's a year and a half later,
and Friday, just yesterday,

00:12:23.208 --> 00:12:24.964
I toured the Bausch + Lomb building.

00:12:24.964 --> 00:12:29.252
Bausch + Lomb was just bought 
by Valeant for nine billion dollars.

00:12:29.542 --> 00:12:33.745
I toured the Bausch + Lomb building
and made a bid on the property -

00:12:35.224 --> 00:12:36.847
in 18 months.

00:12:37.158 --> 00:12:43.871
What can your mind do in 18 months
if you free yourself from fear?

00:12:44.077 --> 00:12:49.967
Nelson Mandela spent 29 years
in prison as a political prisoner,

00:12:49.966 --> 00:12:56.029
having done nothing wrong except
express his ideology and philosophy.

00:12:56.689 --> 00:12:59.708
Everyday, while they made him chip stone,

00:12:59.708 --> 00:13:03.054
he remembered one poem
by William Earnest Henley.

00:13:04.885 --> 00:13:09.542
"Out of the night that covers me
Black as the pit from pole to pole

00:13:09.672 --> 00:13:14.051
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul

00:13:14.306 --> 00:13:18.260
In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud

00:13:18.547 --> 00:13:23.198
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed

00:13:23.838 --> 00:13:27.778
Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the horror of the shade

00:13:28.153 --> 00:13:33.771
And yet the menace of the years
Finds and shall find me unafraid

00:13:34.144 --> 00:13:38.744
It matters not how strait the gate
How charged with punishments the scroll

00:13:39.311 --> 00:13:45.571
I am the master of my fate
I am the captain of my soul"

00:13:47.351 --> 00:13:50.510
Each of us is the master
of our own fate.

00:13:50.885 --> 00:13:53.537
We can overcome fear with gratitude.

00:13:53.537 --> 00:13:57.250
We can overcome fear
with intentional choice.

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.792
And our perception drives reality.

00:14:00.792 --> 00:14:03.168
In life, you don't get
what you deserve, always,

00:14:03.168 --> 00:14:06.299
but you almost always get what you expect.

00:14:08.638 --> 00:14:15.138
That moment where I held my daughter,
I decided, 17-and-a-half years ago,

00:14:15.138 --> 00:14:17.443
that every day
I would tell her I loved her.

00:14:17.863 --> 00:14:20.056
That she would be a beautiful woman.

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:23.468
That she'd be the best daughter
I could ever imagine.

00:14:23.744 --> 00:14:25.026
Her name is Madeline.

00:14:26.076 --> 00:14:28.058
And that she would be smart

00:14:28.058 --> 00:14:33.661
and sophisticated and polite
and kind and grounded.

00:14:35.471 --> 00:14:37.430
She's become exactly that.

00:14:40.402 --> 00:14:44.100
Life happens to us everyday.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.762
We can decide what we will do with it.

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:51.655
Let's all decide that we
are the masters of our fate,

00:14:52.185 --> 00:14:54.511
that we are the captains
of our own souls.

00:14:54.511 --> 00:14:55.571
Thank you.

00:14:55.571 --> 00:14:57.241
(Applause)
