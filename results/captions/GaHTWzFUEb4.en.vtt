00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.960
Anakin’s early years within the Jedi Order
were quite rough from a social standpoint,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.700
as he barely got along with his fellow classmates
and more often than not got frustrated with

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.360
his teachers and those of the High Council,
as they limited his lessons and regularly

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.460
reminded him that he was not ready to move
on toward the more advance classes.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.990
This of course caused him to hold some resentment
toward many Masters of the Order as he felt

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.000
they were holding him back.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.820
Despite this, there was one Jedi Master that
Anakin actually looked up to and held unmatched

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.260
admiration for.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.060
His name was Jorus C’baoth, who despite
holding the Chosen One’s highest admiration

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.910
of, was among the more controversial Jedi
among other Masters and those of the High

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.030
Council.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.850
Both Anakin’s admiration and the Council’s
uneasiness of C’baoth stemmed from his no

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.470
nonsense way of doing things, as well as his
extreme views that the Jedi knew what was

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.790
best for those they were supposed to protect,
in that rather than act as sideline peacekeepers,

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.320
the Jedi should get involved directly in galactic
politics and just fix the injustices and corruption

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.320
themselves.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.860
C’baoth strongly believed that the Jedi’s
unique connection to the Force gave them unparalleled

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.000
insight and inherent superiority over all
non-force sensitives, and because of this

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.680
gift of theirs it was their responsibility
to create societies and governments that were

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.330
most just toward the general populaces, even
if it meant forcibly bringing down current

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.830
systems in place.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.979
This Jedi superiority philosophy of his swept
even into how he walked, marching through

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.400
crowds with unlimited confidence and expecting
everyone else to step aside as he walked past

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.400
them.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.480
He also spoke directly and exactly what was
on his mind, holding nothing back regardless

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.670
of what others may have thought of his opinions
on the matter.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.280
On top of his steadfastness, C’baoth was
among the most powerful Jedi of the Order

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.890
of his generation.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.060
Along with his extraordinary telekinesis abilities,
he also mastered some extraordinary difficult

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.150
powers like Force Meld, where Jedi joined
their minds together through the Force, drawing

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.039
strength from each other and becoming a far
more cohesive fighting unit.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.840
When Anakin first met C’baoth he was instantly
taken aback at how different the Jedi Master

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.840
was.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.090
He quickly began to admire the man and hoped
to grow up to be just like him when he himself

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.940
was given the rank of master.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.150
C’baoth was also among the very few Masters
that continually made note of Anakin’s exceptional

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.110
talents and achievements in the Force, even
to the point of making his own Padawan, Lorana

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.480
Jinzler, feel bad.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.209
As after hearing her Master’s praise of
Anakin for minutes on end, Lorana soon believed

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.650
that compared to Skywalker, she was just an
average Jedi learner in her Master’s eyes.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.300
Unlike the other Masters and those on the
High Council, C’baoth recommend Anakin to

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.740
go beyond his limits and never hold back his
potential, a statement that frustrated Obi-Wan

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.599
who believed his padawan was far too immature
and impatient to learn far more advanced force

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.569
abilities and techniques.

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.129
This was very apparent when C’baoth was
planning on teaching Force Meld to Anakin.

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:09.050
As mentioned earlier, Force Meld was an extremely
difficult ability to master and could even

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.410
dangerously backfire on inexperienced practitioners.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.550
Because of this, it generally wasn’t taught
to Jedi until they’ve reached Knighthood,

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.800
if at all.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.300
But C’baoth didn’t care and wanted to
teach it to Anakin, who at the time was only

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.020
in his early teens and had barely began his
formal training as a padawan.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.080
This actually led to a somewhat heated argument
between Obi Wan and C’baoth, as they argued

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.870
exactly how high Anakin’s expectations bar
should be.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.630
C’baoth argued that limiting a padawan as
to what they can truly achieve was a complete

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.590
waste of their gift of being a force sensitive,
and that limiting what they learn early on

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.870
only limits how much good they can do in the
future when they must rely upon their power

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.360
to help others.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.830
Obi Wan countered by stating that setting
too high a bar for a padawan, especially when

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.769
they are not mature enough, will lead to problems
as they will only experience failure and never

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.480
the healthy satisfaction of steady progression
through their achievements.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.200
That a good balance was needed to be found.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.720
Even with the criticisms C’baoth received
on how he did things and his views on the

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.910
Jedi Order’s purpose, he still remained
an admirable figure in Anakin’s eyes, who

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.479
not only agreed with the Jedi Master’s actions
and views, but also believed he was one that

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.270
could do no wrong.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.389
But C’baoth and Anakin’s interactions
quickly came to an end, when the Jedi Master’s

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.539
proposal for Outbound Flight was finally approved
by both the Senate and Jedi Council.

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.999
Outbound Flight was a project that sought
to colonize the worlds within the Unknown

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:41.270
Regions and ultimately attempt to enter the
next galaxy in order to discover and colonize

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.819
possible frontier worlds for the Republic.

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:49.229
The flight included around 50,000 passengers
and crewmen, and 18 Jedi ranging from Masters

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:50.289
to Knights.

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:54.449
When Outbound Flight made its final stop within
Republic controlled space and launched into

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.619
the Unknown Regions, C’baoth slowly became
a near dictator within the massive vessel.

00:04:59.619 --> 00:05:03.629
He began to ignore the written rules within
the vessel and started to implement his own

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:08.800
way of doing things, even ignoring the captains’
orders who originally had formal leadership

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.990
over the vessel according to the Senate.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.749
He then created an unofficial Jedi training
school as he sought out force sensitives within

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:20.719
the 50,000 passengers and convinced the families
to give over their children so that they could

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:22.370
become future Jedi.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.550
It became quite apparent that while C’baoth
did genuinely wish to colonize the Unknown

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.910
Regions and enter the next galaxy, he may
have had a secret agenda of creating a second

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.300
Jedi Order.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.559
One that would hold his views of how Jedi
should act and look over those they were to

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:38.559
protect.

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:43.159
And either establish this new Jedi Order within
the next galaxy, or even one day return back

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:47.439
to the Republic and possibly overthrow the
old Order with his own.

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:51.569
But these possible plans of his never came
close to fruition, as Outbound Flight was

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:55.940
intercepted by Thrawn who didn’t want the
foreign craft to enter his people’s territory

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.909
within the Unknown Regions.

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:02.119
Despite being given a chance to go around
the Chiss’ territory, C’baoth refused

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:05.439
and decided to push on through, even if it
meant initiating a battle.

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:10.909
A battle did ensue, but not in C'baoth’s
favor, as Thrawn was able to disable the main

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:14.249
offensive and defensive components of Outbound
Flight.

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:18.589
Injured and with full realization that he
was defeated, C’baoth fell to the darkside

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:22.610
and began to force choke Thrawn across space
as the two were communicating through their

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.569
ships respective channels.

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:28.789
While Thrawn was almost killed, he was saved
when radiation bombs were deployed and fully

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:31.779
destroyed Outbound flight and nearly everyone
on it.

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:34.650
And with that C’baoth’s life came to an
end.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.379
But his legacy did not.

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:41.180
At some point prior to his departure on Outbound
Flight, Palpatine was able to obtain his DNA

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.050
and later clone the Jedi Master.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.869
Once fully grown, the clone was turned to
the dark side by Palpatine and tasked in guarding

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:52.009
one of the Emperor’s many secret storehouses.

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:56.529
Eventually the now Grand Admiral Thrawn would
discover the dark Jedi and convince the man

00:06:56.529 --> 00:07:01.219
to join him, using him for his campaign against
the New Republic in his attempt to take back

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:03.089
the galaxy for the Empire.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:07.669
The C’baoth clone would eventually die at
the hands of Mara Jade however, when confronted

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:22.629
by her and Luke Skywalker about a year later.
