00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.760
Hello everyone

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:09.200
Did you know nnly HALF the insulin your body makes each day is made because of the food you eat.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:20.800
What about the other 50%?
You've changed the food, but you're not seeing

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.390
the results you hoped for. If that's you,
then let me tell you about The 50% Percent

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.150
Insulin Problem and what you can do about
it.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.190
Hello, this is old Butter Bob Briggs,
I lost 145 pounds and made a video about how

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.980
I did it called “Butter Makes Your Pants
Fall Off”

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.320
and you can watch that here on my Youtube
channel.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.640
But, in this video I want to talk to you about
how HALF the insulin your body makes, and

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.030
yes I said HALF the insulin, fifty percent
of the daily insulin your body produces has

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.140
nothing to do with the food you eat.
I call this The Fifty Percent Insulin Problem.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.890
Look, everyone in the low carb community understands
if you eat a high carb meal, or a snack cake,

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:11.210
or even worse, one of those big belly washing
soft drinks, your insulin will go WAY UP fast.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:19.920
The message seems so simple.
Carbs drive insulin and insulin drives obesity.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.280
Cut the carbs, reduce the insulin and lose
the weight.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.299
Such a simple message, but is that the whole
story?

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.530
The idea that carbs increase insulin is true,
and for some simply cutting the carbs they

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.969
eat is enough to solve their problem.
But for others, maybe even for you, this might

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:44.770
not be enough, because HALF your insulin problem
is not an eating problem.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.210
So changing what you eat alone, might not
be enough to reverse it.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.340
You might need to an add another strategy.
In this video I want you to see a side of

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.289
this insulin problem that isn’t very well
known.

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:03.200
I call this the Fifty Percent Insulin Problem
I want to very quickly, show you a study that

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.490
will explain what this problem is.
Below you can see the name of the study

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.230
In this study they looked at insulin levels

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.850
throughout the day in a group of people, half
the people were fat, the other half thin.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:26.310
They tested these people's insulin after 10
hours of sleeping and not eating and came

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.080
up with the lowest level of constant insulin
these people always have in their system,

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:40.040
they called this the “Basal insulin secretion
rate”, but I'm going to call it their “Fasting

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.250
Insulin” because whenever you see this number
in a study, they call it the “fasting insulin”.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.450
In other words, this fasting insulin number
is a marker that tells us the minimum constant

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.980
level of insulin that's always circulating
in your blood regardless of whether you're

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.980
eating or not eating, it's always there.
You see, your body releases a certain amount

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.490
of insulin all day long, it happens while
you're eating and even when you're not eating,

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:17.080
even when you're sleeping, and how high or
how low this constant minimum level of insulin

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.430
is, can best be tested after an overnight
fast.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.040
This fasting insulin level could be thought
of as the floor or the lowest constant level

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.140
of insulin, while your level after eating
could be thought of as jumping up to the ceiling,

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.320
or the highest temporary level.
We all know our insulin jumps up to the ceiling

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.590
a few times a day but these high levels are
temporary and they depend on what we've been

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.050
eating.
On the other hand, the fasting level of insulin

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:52.480
is constantly present, like the floor, it
is the ground you stand on all the time.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.000
And this constant background level of insulin,
this floor you stand on, this fasting insulin,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.040
tends to be much higher for fat people than
for thin people.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.760
Now here's the reason I'm telling you about
this stuff.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.920
They tested the day's total insulin to see
what percentage of it happened after eating

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.680
and what percentage of it was this constant
background amount.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.539
And do you know what they found?
They found that this constant background level

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:28.520
of insulin, this floor that your insulin never
goes below, represented between 45 to 50%

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:35.210
of the TOTAL insulin you produce each day.
About HALF of the insulin you produce each

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:42.249
day is this constant background pool of insulin
you always have circulating, regardless of

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:46.060
whether you're eating or not.
Fifty Percent of the insulin released each

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:54.009
day is released as a constant background level,
regardless of how fat or how thin you are.

00:04:54.009 --> 00:05:00.370
This Fifty Percent Insulin Problem is happening
all through the day and this is not dependent

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.389
on what you’re eating.
The skinny people had a lower constant background

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:11.300
level, they had a lower floor, on average,
but this was still about HALF of the insulin

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.930
they produced each day.
The fat people had a higher constant background

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:22.120
level, on average, but this was still about
HALF of the insulin they produced each day.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.419
This is the fifty percent insulin problem.
And if HALF of your daily insulin is higher

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:32.509
than it should be, and it probably is, if
you're fat around the middle, then HALF the

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:38.129
problem you have with insulin is not caused
by what you eat alone.

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:44.120
And if HALF the insulin you produce is not
caused by the food you eat, then simply changing

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.479
your food alone may not be enough to fix this
problem.

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.169
And I think that many people who have not
been successful losing weight with a low carb

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:59.610
diet alone, have found this out the hard way.
If this 50% insulin problem is not related

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.740
to food, what is it related to?
The answer is -

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.669
It is directly associated with how fat you
are.

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:14.710
As you can see from these graphs from several
other studies, the fatter you are, the higher

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:20.490
your fasting insulin level.
The higher your fasting insulin level, the

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:28.340
more background insulin you have all day long.
And the sad news is this, some people have

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:39.559
higher insulin even when they are NOT EATING,
than normal people have AFTER they eat.

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:45.719
Just look at this graph from the work of Dr.
Joseph Kraft.

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:52.360
These people have a fasting insulin rate that
is HIGHER than normal people have, EVEN AFTER

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.449
they eat.
Is it any wonder why some people find losing

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:59.460
weight almost impossible even on a low carb
diet?

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.430
Especially if they try to solve their 50%
insulin problem by changing what they eat

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:11.659
alone, but not changing when they eat, and
we'll talk about that more in a couple minutes.

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:15.460
As you'll see before the end of this video,
changing when you eat is MORE effective at

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.589
attacking this 50% insulin problem, than changing
what you eat alone.

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:25.610
This Fifty Percent Insulin Problem happens
all the time, but as we're about to see, the

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:31.169
higher that background insulin is, the higher
your insulin goes after eating.

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:36.680
So even though the Fifty Percent Insulin Problem
is not about food, it does effect how high

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.740
your insulin spikes after you eat.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.880
As you'll see, in this study published many

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.289
years before the one we just talked about,
they found your insulin levels after you eat

00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:52.219
are likely to rise 5 to 7 times higher, by
one hour after eating, than whatever your

00:07:52.219 --> 00:07:59.999
fasting insulin level was.
If you're diabetic or prediabetic the spike

00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:07.240
is likely to come two hours after eating.
They found whatever your fasting insulin number

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:13.789
is, after you eat, your body will release
an amount of insulin an average of 5 to 7

00:08:13.789 --> 00:08:20.119
times higher than whatever that level of constant
background insulin is.

00:08:20.119 --> 00:08:25.809
Remember these are averages, for some the
spike could be much higher or a little lower.

00:08:25.809 --> 00:08:29.860
But the important thing to remember is this
- the spike in insulin after you eat is based

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:34.630
on how high or how low your fasting insulin
levels are.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:39.649
To make this a little more clear, let's look
at an example with some real numbers.

00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:43.769
If a person has a fasting insulin level of
say 8 microunits.

00:08:43.769 --> 00:08:53.050
After that person eats, their insulin will
spike an average of 5 to 7 times higher.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:09:00.529
Their AFTER eating insulin will rise to an
average level of between 45 to 56 microunits,

00:09:00.529 --> 00:09:04.860
which is within the normal range.
They ate a meal, but because their fasting

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:10.850
insulin number was fairly low, their after
eating numbers stayed in the fairly normal

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.639
range.
But lets say a person had a high fasting insulin

00:09:14.639 --> 00:09:22.050
level of 30 microunits. First, that person
is likely to be fat if they have a number

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:29.170
that high, and so, after that fat person with
a fasting number of 30 eats the SAME meal

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:37.670
the skinny person ate, their insulin would
rise to 150 to 210 microunits, which is 5

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:42.649
to 7 times higher than that fat person's fasting
insulin number, but more than that, it is

00:09:42.649 --> 00:09:50.339
is 3 times higher than the skinny persons,
who just ate the exact same food.

00:09:50.339 --> 00:09:55.820
Both people ate the same meal, but the higher
the constant background insulin, or what we're

00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:01.920
calling the Fifty Percent Insulin Problem,
the higher their insulin spiked after eating.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:08.569
Both of these people had a spike after eating,
which is normal, but because the 50% insulin

00:10:08.569 --> 00:10:14.040
problem was much higher in the fat person,
their insulin jumped to a level three times

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.329
higher than the thin person's who ate the
same food that they did.

00:10:18.329 --> 00:10:24.089
By the way, I found this to be true for myself
when I took an insulin/glucose tolerance test

00:10:24.089 --> 00:10:31.319
in October of 2015. Since being normal weight,
I have a fasting insulin level of about 3

00:10:31.319 --> 00:10:39.690
microunits and after taking a glucose test
my insulin level rose to 18 which is about

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:49.810
a 6 fold increase. Then by the third hour
I was back down to the 3 microunits of my

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.240
fasting insulin level.
Let’s sum up what we know:

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:57.880
Some foods like carbs and lean processed protein,
like whey protein powders, cause your insulin

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:06.399
to go very high after eating, but this insulin
only amounts to 50% of your insulin problem.

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:12.630
What you eat determines this number, so when
you eat low carb, you keep this number lower.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:17.350
The other 50% of your daily insulin is associated
with how fat you are.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:23.459
It is an insulin problem and the best way
to solve it is to periodically hold insulin

00:11:23.459 --> 00:11:29.069
very very low, as low as possible and this
low insulin will allow us to begin burning

00:11:29.069 --> 00:11:35.519
up that extra body fat around your belly,
your butt and your chinny, chin chins.

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:39.889
The association between how fat you are and
how high your constant background insulin

00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:46.610
levels are, could be pictured as an internal
fat thermostat which has been called the “body

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:51.670
set weight”.
In other words, the higher the fasting insulin

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:57.110
level, that constant background insulin that
we've been talking about, then however high

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:04.819
or low that rate is, will determine how high
your insulin spikes after eating.

00:12:04.819 --> 00:12:09.069
All these things are like a thermostat, a
thermostat that sets how much fat the body

00:12:09.069 --> 00:12:13.690
holds onto.
The more insulin, the higher the body “sets”

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:20.360
your fat weight thermostat.
If insulin levels cause the body to set the

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:25.310
amount of fat you carry to a certain level,
then the question becomes, could you turn

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:33.350
down that thermostat by lowering and keeping
low your constant background insulin levels?

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:39.209
I think the obvious answer is YES.
And if you want to turn down this thermostat,

00:12:39.209 --> 00:12:45.750
you need use the most effective strategy you
can find to get insulin down as low as possible

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:51.480
and hold it there as often as possible.
And when I say as often as possible, I'm talking

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:56.690
about adding an element of TIMING to the Low
Carb idea.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:04.620
The Low Carb idea is about what to eat and
what not to eat to keep insulin low, but what

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:10.959
I'm talking about is not about what to eat,
it is about the TIMING of eating.

00:13:10.959 --> 00:13:16.949
Not eating for a period of time, even a short
period like 16 to 24 hours, is very effective

00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:22.360
at lowering insulin.
A Short Fast actually lowers insulin BETTER

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:27.610
than Low Carb and it's cheap, it's simple
and best of all, not eating for short periods

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:35.230
of time is NATURE'S way to balance the books.
Low Carb High Fat is great because in many

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:43.709
ways, it imitates fasting, and Low Carb is
very effective at lowering insulin.

00:13:43.709 --> 00:13:49.759
But fasting is the real deal, because any
eating raises insulin, no matter what you

00:13:49.759 --> 00:13:55.670
eat.
Low Carb foods are great at keeping the after

00:13:55.670 --> 00:14:03.329
eating insulin spike lower, but a short 16
to 24 hour fast is fifty percent more effective

00:14:03.329 --> 00:14:05.560
than even Low Carb at lowering insulin. And
the most sustainable strategy you can take

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:05.889
is - combining them into a two front attack
on your problem, low carb high fat eating,

00:14:05.889 --> 00:14:06.209
combined with and followed by, fasting for
short 16 to 24 hours periods is powerful.

00:14:06.209 --> 00:14:11.430
So what does fasting do?
Fasting 24 hours every other day has been

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:16.660
shown to increase how sensitive your body
is to insulin.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:23.810
Being more sensitive to something is easily
understood by thinking of how alcohol effects

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:31.170
you, if you aren't used to drinking. Just
one or two drinks and you'll really feel it.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.680
The same for insulin, if you become more sensitive,
then a little insulin will do the job it takes

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.009
a lot to do now.
If your body is more sensitive, then you need

00:14:35.009 --> 00:14:41.029
less insulin to get the same job done.
In the short time of just 22 days of fasting

00:14:41.029 --> 00:14:47.079
every other day, people became SEVEN times
more sensitive to insulin.

00:14:47.079 --> 00:14:52.889
Seven times more sensitive.
Just fasting every other day for about 3 weeks,

00:14:52.889 --> 00:14:58.189
makes you seven times more sensitive to insulin,
folks this is amazing stuff.

00:14:58.189 --> 00:15:06.949
And it get's better, on the every other fasting
day, their fasting insulin was 57% lower.

00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:12.810
That's a lowering of the background insulin
and a lowering of the 50% insulin problem

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:20.610
every other day by over HALF, by almost 60%.
And this not eating every other day, increased

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:28.439
the body's fat burning by 58%.
That 58% increase in fat burning is freaking

00:15:28.439 --> 00:15:32.240
amazing.
That's your belly being burned up at a rate

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:37.649
almost 60% higher.
And I want to point something out about this

00:15:37.649 --> 00:15:42.110
study that these graphs come from - the people
in this study who were fasting every other

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.189
day, were NOT EATING LOW CARB on their eating
days.

00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:51.420
They were eating whatever the heck they wanted,
so you can just imagine how much lower their

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:57.430
insulin would have been if they had eaten
a low carb diet on their eating day.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:00.569
Just image how much faster their results would
have been, if they had held their insulin

00:16:00.569 --> 00:16:03.660
lower even on their eating days.
In another study, not eating carbohydrates

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:14.689
at all for three days lowered insulin 48%.
But not eating anything for three days, or

00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:25.730
fasting, lowered insulin by a whopping 69%.
As you can see, Low carb is great, but fasting

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:32.149
is almost 50% better than low carb at lowering
your insulin.

00:16:32.149 --> 00:16:41.350
And this one - two punch of eating LCHF during
eating times and then short 16 to 24 hour

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:46.180
fasts is the strategy I used and the one I
recommend to you.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:52.180
No other strategy is more effective. And it
is more sustainable. This is something you

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:56.999
can do long-term folks.
As we've seen, not eating for three days lowered

00:16:56.999 --> 00:17:03.999
insulin almost 70%, but fasting that long
might be too hard for some people to do,

00:17:03.999 --> 00:17:10.679
but the good news is, two-thirds of that 70%
reduction in insulin over a three day fast,

00:17:10.679 --> 00:17:18.909
is achieved in the first 24 hours. In other
words, if three days of fasting makes your

00:17:18.909 --> 00:17:27.500
insulin go down 70%, the good news is, during
the first day of that fast, 70% of all the

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:35.610
insulin reduction is already happened.
So even a 24 hour fast reduces insulin almost

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:42.390
as much as a 3 day fast could do and a short
24 hour fast from dinner time today until

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:49.360
dinner time tomorrow is really easy to do
and much more sustainable long term than a

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:59.270
long 3 day fast.
Just look what happens during a short fast.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:03.980
After just 11 hours, fatty acids, this is
your fat being released folks, fatty acids

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:09.010
being released are GREATLY increased. Just
look at that steep rise around 11 hours. That's

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:16.400
your big belly slowly but surely being burned
up with a little fasting time each day.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:22.730
After just 13 hours, ketones are greatly increased.
As you know, ketones are made from your body

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:28.010
fat and used by the body as a substitute energy
source.

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:32.890
Everybody in the low carb world worries about
whether or not they are in ketosis, but as

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:41.000
you can see, after 13 hours ketones are greatly
increasing. You are making ketones while fasting.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:50.830
And these ketones can continue to rise higher
and higher for days so long as the fast continues.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:57.120
Longer fasts have a higher rate of ketones,
but you don't have to do long fasts, simply

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:05.870
do a good 16 to 24 hour fast and know the
ketones are on a steep rise after 13 hours.

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:12.210
And Insulin falls a lot by 3 to 4 hours after
eating and then falls even further by 10 hours

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:20.640
after eating.
Remember, 70% of the fall in insulin during

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:25.559
a long fast, a three day fast, happens during
the first 24 hours.

00:19:25.559 --> 00:19:34.059
So most the insulin reduction that happens
in a long fast, happens during your short

00:19:34.059 --> 00:19:41.760
fast.
So eat a LCHF diet during eating times and

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:49.860
use the complete appetite control that diet
gives you to not eat when not hungry, this

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:56.330
not eating when not hungry is fasting.
It's easy to do, you're already doing it now

00:19:56.330 --> 00:20:01.750
when you sleep, all you need to do is extend
the time. Delaying eating breakfast for a

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:08.179
few hours can give you a 16 hour fast and
most of that time you were asleep. Easy.

00:20:08.179 --> 00:20:13.490
Now, a video like this can't go into all the
benefits of fasting, so if you want to really

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:18.720
learn about intermittent fasting, the most
complete source of information, and I mean

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:24.960
THE most complete source, can be found on
Dr. Jason Fung’s excellent blog. He has

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:34.220
an huge free 26 part blog series about fasting
that is a wealth of information on this topic.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:40.679
There simply is not a better resource about
this on the internet and here's the link.

00:20:40.679 --> 00:20:46.450
Thank you for watching and I hope this helps
you. While you're here on Youtube, I hope

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:58.249
you'll watch some of my other videos, or visit
