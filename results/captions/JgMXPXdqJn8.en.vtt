00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.381
There is a region on Mars, roughly the size
of Australia, that rises high above the surface

00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:17.800
of the planet. Three of the largest volcanoes
in the solar system line up to guard its western

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.800
flank.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:28.609
To the East, a vast canyon, six to seven times
deeper than the Grand Canyon, cuts into the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:37.700
barren Martian plain. This strange region,
once so baffling to scientists, recalls the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:48.900
planet's violent past, a time long ago when
the planet's core erupted, pushing molten

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.121
rock to the surface.

00:00:50.121 --> 00:00:59.680
It's part of a larger story, a planetary tragedy,
in which Mars began its descent into the cold,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.799
dry, and lifeless state that we see today.
We are now scouring its surprisingly complex

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:18.280
surface for clues to the events that long
ago doomed the Red Planet, Mars.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:32.020
Since the early 1960s, we've tried 46 times
to send spacecraft to Mars across the 55 million

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.360
kilometers of its closest approach to Earth.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:45.479
Over half failed at launch or upon arrival.
The rest flew around the planet, snapping

00:01:45.479 --> 00:02:03.289
pictures, recording data. Or they landed to
test its soil and rocks, and crawl around

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.479
its canyons and craters.

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.930
These probes may one day pave the way for
human explorers, who will dig deeper still,

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.330
in search of answers to our most pressing
question:

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:27.640
Did Mars, at some point long ago develop far
enough for life to arise? If so, does anything

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:39.330
still live within Mars' dusty plains, beneath
its ice caps, or somewhere underground?

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.780
Mars does not give up its secrets easily.
Over the years, that has led observers on

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.960
this planet to jump to all sorts of conclusions.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:57.420
In the year 1877, the Italian astronomer Giovanni
Schiaparelli noted markings on Mars' surface,

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:05.870
a latticework of lines. He called them "canali"
in Italian, meaning "channels" in English.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.830
A careful and thorough observer, Schiaparelli
began to sketch them and name them, connecting

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.630
them in a vast global network.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.680
Over a 15-year period, beginning in 1894,
the American astronomer, Percival Lowell,

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:29.210
closely examined these features. He saw a
remarkable drama unfolding on our neighboring

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.640
planet.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.210
In his view, Schiaparelli's channels were
artificial canals, designed perhaps to carry

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:46.770
melting snow from the poles to the dry interior.
After all, on Earth, the Suez Canal had been

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:55.380
open since 1869. Construction on the Panama
Canal had just gotten underway.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.700
The Martian canals, Lowell surmised, had been
built by a sophisticated society confronting

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:08.930
an environmental catastrophe on the grandest
of scales. Its inhabitants faced an urgent

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.960
choice: move water across vast arid regions,
or perish on an increasingly dry planet.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:26.550
In a series of three best-selling books, Lowell
took his case to the public. The public responded

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.020
with some ideas of their own.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.479
With the means to remake an entire planet,
perhaps these Martians were more advanced

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:44.439
than humans. Some of us began offering schemes
for making contact. Giant mirrors to flash

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:49.939
greetings. Light beams. Mental telepathy.

00:04:49.939 --> 00:05:00.590
Lowell vision fell by the wayside in 1964.
The Mariner Four spacecraft flew by Mars and

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:07.930
got a good look. What it saw looked more like
the Moon than the Earth. Three more Mariners

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.620
followed, culminating in the arrival of Mariner
Nine in 1971, the first spacecraft to go into

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.620
orbit around Mars.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.360
These missions documented a heavily cratered
landscape, pocked with huge dormant volcanoes...

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.360
and cut with the deepest and longest canyon
in the solar system. They saw no traces of

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.340
life, present or past.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:34.189
Then, in the mid-1970's, two lander-orbiter
robot teams, named Viking, went in for an

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:41.300
even closer look. The landers tested the soil
for the chemical residues of life. All the

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:49.880
evidence from Viking told us: Mars is dead.
And extremely harsh.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:59.280
The mission recorded Martian surface temperatures
from -17 degrees Celsius down to -107. We

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:07.151
now know it can get even colder than that
at the poles. The atmosphere is 95% carbon

00:06:07.151 --> 00:06:15.610
dioxide, with only traces of oxygen. And it's
extremely thin, with less than one percent

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.110
the surface pressure of Earth's atmosphere.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:26.270
And it's bone dry. In fact, the Sahara Desert
is a rainforest compared to Mars, where water

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:34.509
vapor is a trace gas in the atmosphere. On
Earth, impact craters erode over time from

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:43.999
wind and water... and even volcanic activity.
On Mars, they can linger for billions of years.

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:49.409
Earth's surface is shaped and reshaped by
the horizontal movement of plates that make

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:57.870
up its crust driven by heat welling up from
the planet's hot interior. At half the width

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:04.490
and only 11% the mass of Earth, Mars doesn't
generate enough heat to support wide-scale

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.270
plate tectonics.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:12.189
Nor does it have the gravity to hold a thick
atmosphere needed to store enough heat at

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:21.349
the surface to allow liquid water to flow.
Nonetheless, some areas that looked to Viking-era

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:30.089
scientists like craters and volcanic areas,
were later shown to be riverbeds, lake bottoms,

00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:31.319
and ocean shorelines.

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:44.469
If water once flowed on Mars' surface, where
did it all go?

00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:52.879
This was the scene at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Lab in 2004. The twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity

00:07:52.879 --> 00:08:00.169
had just bounced down on the Red Planet. When
the excitement died down, the rovers were

00:08:00.169 --> 00:08:08.169
set off on one of the most remarkable journeys
in the history of planetary exploration.

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:14.229
Opportunity had come to rest in a small crater
near the equator, at a spot called Meridiani

00:08:14.229 --> 00:08:23.430
Planum. Here, in plain view, on a nearby crater
wall, its camera revealed exposed bedrock,

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:30.490
the first ever seen on Mars. Not far away,
the rover found layered rocks on the face

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:40.430
of a cliff. On Earth, they typically form
as sedimentary layers at the bottom of oceans.

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:47.440
And at every turn, Opportunity rolled across
tiny, smooth, round pellets. They became known

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:54.550
as "blueberries" because they appeared purplish-brown
against Mars' rust-colored surface. Initially

00:08:54.550 --> 00:09:00.490
thought to be volcanic in origin, they turned
out to be iron-rich spherules of the type

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.980
that form within cavities in the mud at the
bottom of an ocean.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:14.089
Drilling into rocks, the rover inserted a
spectrometer to read the mineral content.

00:09:14.089 --> 00:09:23.970
The readings showed significant amounts of
sulfate salt, a tracer for standing water.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:33.829
That wasn't all. Spirit's broken wheel, dragging
behind it, exposed soils saturated in salt.

00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:40.750
Clearly there once was water on Mars' surface,
but how long ago? And, if there is anything

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:51.760
left, where would you find it? One possible
answer: the North Pole. From orbit, this region

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:59.320
seemed to be covered in frozen CO2 - what
we call dry ice. But was there water ice below

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.320
the surface?

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:23.889
Enter Phoenix, a lander that touched down
near the North Pole in early 2008. Radar readings

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:30.250
from orbit, taken by the Mars Express mission,
hinted at the presence of ice just below the

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:31.350
surface.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:37.550
The Phoenix lander's descent thrusters blew
away the top layer of soil, allowing its camera

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:44.269
to snap pictures of what looked like ice.
Scientists instructed the robot to conduct

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:51.660
a simple experiment: reach out and dig a trench,
then watch what happens.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:11:01.060
As expected, clumps of white stuff appeared.
A couple of days later, it was gone. Vaporized.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:07.519
That means it can't be salt or frozen CO2,
which is stable in the cold dry temperatures

00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:18.089
of the Martian pole. So it had to be water,
the first ever directly seen on Mars.

00:11:18.089 --> 00:11:23.459
There are indications that the North Pole
was actually warm enough in the recent past

00:11:23.459 --> 00:11:31.759
for water ice to become liquid. The Mars Reconaissance
Orbiter, or MRO, used radar pulses to peer

00:11:31.759 --> 00:11:37.970
beneath the surface of the ice cap. These
data reveal that the ice, just over a mile

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:47.990
thick, formed in a succession of layers as
the climate alternated between warm and cold.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:53.990
Our planet avoids mood swings like this in
part because its spin is stabilized by a massive

00:11:53.990 --> 00:12:01.390
moon. Mars' spin is not, so it can really
wobble, with the pole tilting toward the sun

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:10.240
for long periods. New observations by the
MRO spacecraft show that these wobbles can

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:16.760
lead to dramatic releases of CO2, and warming
periods due to an increase in the greenhouse

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.230
effect.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:28.279
The ice now detected below Mar's surface is
a remnant of a much earlier time. The thinking

00:12:28.279 --> 00:12:34.060
is that not long after its birth, the planet's
molten interior would have spewed out enough

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.420
gas to form an atmosphere.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:47.360
Carbon dioxide and water vapor began to trap
heat from sunlight. 

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:52.730
Temperatures rose high enough to allow liquid
water to flow on the surface, creating myriad

00:12:52.730 --> 00:13:00.839
rivers, ponds, lakes and oceans.

00:13:00.839 --> 00:13:06.500
Evidence of this thicker atmosphere landed,
literally, in Opportunity's backyard. The

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:14.769
rover spied a strange bluish rock, a nickel
iron meteorite named Block Island. Streaking

00:13:14.769 --> 00:13:21.459
through a thin atmosphere, this massive chunk
of metal should have been obliterated on contact.

00:13:21.459 --> 00:13:28.959
Instead, its fall was likely slowed, and its
impact softened, by a much thicker atmosphere.

00:13:28.959 --> 00:13:36.850
What then caused the atmosphere, and the water,
to disappear, and the planet to grow cold

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:45.661
and dry? The answer comes from data recorded
by the Mars Global Surveyor just after it

00:13:45.661 --> 00:13:49.850
went into orbit in 1997.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:55.560
Its instruments detected the presence of a
weak magnetic field emanating from the planet,

00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:03.970
a reading that scientists eagerly compared
to that of Earth. Our planet's magnetic field

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:10.300
is generated by molten rock deep in its core
that rises and falls into a vast region below

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.410
the outer crust, called the mantle.

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:17.300
It has turned Earth into an electric dynamo.
The rising and sinking motion within, combined

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:24.910
with the spinning motion of the planet, generates
a strong magnetic field. You can trace this

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:30.950
field back to Earth's early years, when large
amounts of heavy elements such as iron sank

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:38.500
into its core. Radioactive decay began to
generate heat and the planet's mass is large

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.100
enough to hold it in.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:47.510
Earth's magnetic field extends far enough
out into space to deflect the wind of high-energy

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:55.860
solar particles. Without a similar electromagnetic
"deflector shield" on Mars, solar radiation

00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:02.839
lashed the planet, gradually stripping it
of its atmosphere. What water Mars had would

00:15:02.839 --> 00:15:09.160
have vaporized into space or frozen underground.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:15.460
However, there is evidence that at one time
Mars did have a robust magnetic field. Rocks

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:21.399
in some of the older craters bear a strong
imprint of this field, while newer craters

00:15:21.399 --> 00:15:25.790
indicate a much weaker field.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:33.450
What happened to it? The answer lies deep
in Mars' past, in events so powerful they

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:46.410
are still written on the landscape. 
This is a simple elevation map of Mars' surface,

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:53.639
from data gathered by the Mars Odyssey spacecraft.
The South Pole, colored in red and orange,

00:15:53.639 --> 00:15:56.720
is piled high with ice.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:02.889
Moving off these southern highlands, we make
our way north. The landscape is pocked with

00:16:02.889 --> 00:16:11.199
craters. The largest and oldest ones have
faded, their edges softened by windblown dust.

00:16:11.199 --> 00:16:17.250
Moving up along the equator, we pass into
a region called Tharsis, based on a biblical

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:22.240
name for the western edge of the known world.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:29.899
On the edge of this vast high altitude plateau
is a series of enormous volcanoes: Ascraeus

00:16:29.899 --> 00:16:44.430
Mons: 18 kilometers high. Pavonis Mons: 14
kilometers. Arsia Mons: 16 kilometers. Just

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:54.290
beyond, is the largest volcano in our solar
system, Olympus Mons, 25 kilometers in elevation.

00:16:54.290 --> 00:17:00.290
The thinking is that the Tharsis region bulged
out when a giant dome of magma pushed up from

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:07.339
the planet's core. The volcanoes grew large
because Mars lacks the constant shifting of

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:16.230
crustal plates that, on Earth, leads to chains
of smaller volcanoes like the Hawaiian Islands.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:21.850
Just to the East is the great Valles Marineris
- named for the Mariner Nine mission that

00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:29.390
found this vast gash in the Martian landscape.
It's about 4000 kilometers long and up to

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:37.830
200 kilometers wide. On Earth, Valles Marineris
would stretch from Los Angeles all the way

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:46.970
to the Atlantic coast.

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:53.650
If you went to Valles Marineris, you'd see
dust devils sweeping along the plains above

00:17:53.650 --> 00:18:08.690
it and dust blowing up the canyon walls. Here's
a realistic rendering of data captured by

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:15.450
spacecraft. Giant landslides have caused the
walls to slump off and pile onto the valley

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.690
floor.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:24.530
Feeding into the valley: a maze of side channels.
Scientists think these and other tributary

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:30.520
features were formed when underground water
flowed into the main basin, and the land above

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:38.770
collapsed. Wider parts of the canyon are regarded
as possible landing sites for a manned mission.

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:43.580
They offer flat surfaces and possible access
to liquid water that may remain below the

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.120
surface.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:54.020
The theory is that Valles Marineris formed
when the planet began to cool. Its sides were

00:18:54.020 --> 00:19:01.140
pulled apart as the Tharsis plateau, just
to the west, began to rise up. That chain

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:09.080
of events is now being linked to a much larger
planetary event, what one scientist called

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:18.789
"the" defining moment in Mars' history.

00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:26.651
Travel north, down the slopes of Mars's great
volcanoes. The elevation drops as we move

00:19:26.651 --> 00:19:33.510
across what appears to be an immense ocean,
colored here in blue. With this so-called

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:40.120
Borealis Basin in the north, and the high
elevations of the South, Mars is a lopsided

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:45.700
planet. In fact, there is a difference of
about 30 kilometers in the thickness of the

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.220
crust in these two regions.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.169
Here's the reason:

00:19:51.169 --> 00:20:02.580
Early on, when the Solar System was young,
Mars was hit by at least 15 large asteroids.

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:08.280
Scientists have linked these events to a time
around 3.9 billion years ago, known as the

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.980
late heavy bombardment, when rock samples
from the Apollo landings show that our own

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:30.320
moon was seriously pummeled.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:35.990
One theory holds that these impacts heated
the outer subsurface layer of the planet,

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:42.010
Mars' "mantle." That prevented molten rock
in its core from rising up... and caused the

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:49.470
crust to thicken. This had the effect of shutting
off Mars' magnetic field, exposing the planet

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:55.610
to damaging solar winds, and over time, turning
it into a wasteland.

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:58.400
One model says that as the newly formed giant
gas planets, Jupiter and Saturn, moved in

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.120
their orbits, they hurled a rain of asteroids
and comets at the inner solar system. There

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:06.179
are other theories that explain the disappearance
of Mars magnetic field and its atmosphere.

00:21:06.179 --> 00:21:14.320
What's certain is that at some point early
in its history, the Red Planet grew increasingly

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.990
desolate.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:24.110
The Martian landscape we see today is replete
with coded signals from those early times,

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:31.950
ancient riverbeds and lake bottoms, flood
plains, and volcanic cones, as well as the

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:36.010
battering it received from impacts.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:47.990
But is Mars a dead world? Maybe. Maybe not.
An infrared telescope on Hawaii's Mauna Kea

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:55.330
volcano was trained on Mars over several years.
Astronomers used a spectrometer to split the

00:21:55.330 --> 00:22:01.010
light into its individual wavelengths... to
identify chemical fingerprints in the atmosphere.

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:09.260
They found the signature of methane gas, in
amounts that change from place to place. Because

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:15.309
methane should disappear quickly in Mars'
atmosphere, there must be some source that

00:22:15.309 --> 00:22:17.690
constantly replenishes it.

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:23.070
That source could amount to nothing more than
the chemical reactions in Mars' crust. Or

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:33.330
it could be biological in nature, perhaps
microbes alive and well in heated pools underground.

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:40.350
So far, neither the satellites flying over
Mars, nor the robots on the ground, have turned

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:48.419
up anything close to clear proof of life.
It may take the searching eyes, flexible minds,

00:22:48.419 --> 00:22:57.450
and nimble fingers of human explorers to find
that buried treasure, if it exists.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:04.720
In the meantime, we are finding that even
if Mars is dead, it's certainly not dull.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:18.330
Mars has nowhere near the dynamism of Earth,
with its oceans, atmosphere, volcanism, and

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:26.200
shifting continents. But it does do some fascinating
things:

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:33.130
If you take an atmosphere, however tenuous,
add heat from the sun. You get the renowned

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:43.710
dust devils of Mars. With no trees to hold
the soil down, landslides are common.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:49.600
The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has returned
images showing that Mars is actively remaking

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:56.260
its surface, not in canals built by the Martian
engineers of Percival Lowell's imagination,

00:23:56.260 --> 00:24:04.340
but in sand dunes shaped by the wind, and
in landscapes molded by a gradually changing

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:12.390
climate. Some scientists have even turned
up hints of low-level plate tectonics.

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:21.350
Whether or not we ever find life-forms on
Mars, we can still marvel at the beauty of

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:32.679
our neighboring planet, its surface subtly
sculpted over eons of time, on a world that

00:24:32.679 --> 00:24:33.679
never was.

00:24:33.679 --> 00:24:33.680
