00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:02.369
The President:
Thank you very much.

00:00:02.369 --> 00:00:05.438
Mr. Vice President,
Secretary Mattis,

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:08.608
General Dunford, senior
military leaders,

00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:12.545
and distinguished guests,
thank you all for being here

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:17.517
as we prepare to sign something 
that is extremely important:

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:21.187
the National Defense Authorization Act.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.455
We're signing
it into law.

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:25.525
This historic legislation
demonstrates

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:28.094
our unwavering commitment
to our men and women

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:31.231
in uniform -- the greatest
fighting force

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.465
in the history of the world.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:36.336
And we're making it a lot
better than even that.

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:38.938
Before we begin, I want
to address the terrorist attack

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:42.075
that took place
yesterday in New York City,

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:45.945
and to praise the
first responders, local police,

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:49.382
and federal law enforcement 
for their quick action.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.951
They did an
incredible job.

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:54.154
There have now been two
terrorist attacks

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:55.755
in New York City 
in recent weeks

00:00:55.755 --> 00:01:00.693
carried out by foreign nationals, 
here on green cards.

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:04.564
The first attacker came
through the visa lottery

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:07.667
and the second through
chain migration.

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:09.803
We're going to
end both of them.

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:12.672
The lottery system and
chain migration --

00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:15.809
we're going to end them fast.

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:19.846
Congress must get
involved immediately,

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:21.414
and they are involved
immediately,

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:23.583
and I can tell you we have
tremendous support.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:24.684
They will be ended.

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:27.420
These attacks underscore
the dangers we face

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.488
from around the globe.

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:31.324
The National Defense
Authorization Act

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:36.663
could not come at a more
opportune or important time.

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:39.132
This legislation
represents a momentous

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:41.734
step toward rebuilding
our military and securing

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:44.838
the future for
our children.

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:47.774
I applaud the work of the
members of both parties

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.108
who came together to pass

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:53.279
the National Defense Authorization Act,

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:56.483
which passed with 
overwhelming bipartisan support --

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:59.385
something that sounds 
very nice to my ears.

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:02.689
I especially want
to thank Chairman Thornberry,

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:03.890
who is here
with us today,

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.459
for his tireless efforts.

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:11.231
Fantastic job.

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:13.233
In recent years, our
military has undergone

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:16.870
a series of deep budget
cuts that have severely

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.973
impacted our readiness,
shrunk our capabilities,

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:24.711
and placed substantial
burdens on our warfighters.

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:27.881
And great warfighters
they are.

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:31.050
History teaches us that
when you weaken your defenses,

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.152
you invite aggression.

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:36.122
The best way to prevent
conflict or be --

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:40.126
of any kind -- 
is to be prepared,

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:43.396
and really be prepared.

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:48.968
Only when the good
are strong will peace prevail.

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:52.539
Today, with the signing
of this defense bill,

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:54.107
we accelerate the process

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:58.344
of fully restoring 
America's military might.

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:01.281
I also want to thank
Senator John McCain

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:04.083
for the work he's
done on this bill.

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:07.220
He has fought very, very
hard to make it

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.323
just the way he wants it and
that we all want it.

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:12.759
This legislation will
enhance our readiness,

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:15.862
expand our modernized --
and modernize our forces,

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:18.798
and help provide our
servicemembers

00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:23.102
with the tools that they need
to fight and to win.

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:24.604
We will fight and win.

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:27.707
But hopefully, with this,
we won't have to fight

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:31.744
because people will not
be wanting to fight with us.

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:34.881
It authorizes funding for
our continued campaign

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:36.215
to obliterate ISIS.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:43.920
As you know, we've won in
Syria, we've won in Iraq.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.360
But they spread to other
areas and we're getting

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:50.663
them as fast
as they spread.

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:52.432
We've had more success
with ISIS

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:56.436
in the last eight months than
the entire previous

00:03:56.436 --> 00:04:01.774
administration has had
during its entire term.

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:05.712
It approves missile
defense capabilities

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:10.316
as we continue our campaign
to create maximum

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:14.253
pressure on the vile
dictatorship in North Korea.

00:04:14.253 --> 00:04:17.991
We're working very
diligently on that --

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:19.092
building up forces.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:21.160
We'll see how it
all turns out.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.396
It's a very bad situation
-- a situation

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:24.297
that should have been handled

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:26.866
long ago by other administrations.

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:29.268
It upgrades our Ground
Combat Vehicles,

00:04:29.268 --> 00:04:33.673
allows for the purchase of new
Joint Strike Fighter aircraft,

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:36.409
and paves the
way for beautiful

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:41.881
new Virginia-class submarines
-- the finest in the world.

00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:44.751
Finally, the defense bill 
authorizes major investments

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:48.955
in our military's greatest 
weapon of all: its warriors.

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:52.659
The NDAA increases the size 
of the American Armed Forces

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:55.028
for the
first time in seven years,

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:56.462
and it
provides our military

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:59.265
servicemembers with their
largest pay increase

00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:01.367
in eight years.

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:05.038
Now Congress must finish
the job by eliminating

00:05:05.038 --> 00:05:08.374
the defense sequester

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:11.511
and passing a clean 
appropriations bill.

00:05:11.511 --> 00:05:13.613
I think it's
going to happen.

00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:14.747
We need our military.

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:18.918
It's got to be perfecto.

00:05:18.918 --> 00:05:21.621
At this time of grave
global threats,

00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:26.259
I urge Democrats in Congress
to drop their shutdown threats

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:31.431
and descend clean funding 
and a clean funding bill

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:36.069
to my desk that fully 
funds our great military.

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:38.304
Protecting our country
should always be a

00:05:38.304 --> 00:05:41.574
bipartisan issue, just
like today's legislation.

00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:46.913
We must work across party
lines to give our heroic troops

00:05:46.913 --> 00:05:49.015
the equipment,
resources, and support

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:52.919
that they have earned
a thousand times over.

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.755
Together, we will send
a clear message to our allies

00:05:55.755 --> 00:05:58.825
and a firm warning
to our enemies

00:05:58.825 --> 00:06:02.528
and adversaries: America
is strong, proud,

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:03.863
determined, and ready.

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:06.132
And I might add, when
we're completed --

00:06:06.132 --> 00:06:09.635
and it won't be that long -- we
will be stronger than

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:13.206
ever before -- by a lot.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.875
So thank you to all of
our friends in Congress.

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:19.679
And we do appreciate the
bipartisan support,

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:22.348
and we appreciate your hard
work on this historic

00:06:22.348 --> 00:06:24.984
defense authorization.

00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:28.154
And thank you, most
of all, to our brave warriors

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:31.124
for standing
watch over our country,

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:32.692
our families,
and our freedom.

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:36.362
Brand-new, beautiful
equipment is on its way --

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:37.964
the best you've
ever had by far.

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:41.968
We make the best in the world, 
and you're going to have it.

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:44.003
God bless you, God bless
our military,

00:06:44.003 --> 00:06:45.100
and God bless America.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.820
Thank you very much.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.240
Thank you.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.115
I won't be showing all
of this to everybody,

00:06:56.115 --> 00:06:56.983
believe it or not.

00:06:56.983 --> 00:06:58.951
That's a lot of pages.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.580
That is a lot of pages.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:19.620
(The bill is signed.)

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:32.580
(Applause.)

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.320
The President: Thank you 
very much everybody.

00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:37.156
The Press: Mr. President, what 
did you mean when you said that

00:07:37.156 --> 00:07:40.459
Kirsten Gillibrand will do 
anything for a campaign contribution
