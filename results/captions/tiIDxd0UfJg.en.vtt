00:01:20.852 --> 00:01:22.219
TERMS OF BORDER SECURITY IN

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.488

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:26.056

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:32.029

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.465
WELL, I AGREE WITH THAT APPROACH

00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:35.566
BUT WE HAVE DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE

00:01:35.567 --> 00:01:38.702
IN THE PAST VOTED FOR BORDER

00:01:38.703 --> 00:01:39.536

NOW CALL IT IMMORAL AND ARE

00:01:43.374 --> 00:01:44.808
CALLING FOR TEARING DOWN THE

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:45.375
WALL.

00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:46.043
PRESIDENT OBAMA, PRESIDENT

CLINTON SAID WE HAD TO DO MORE

00:01:48.346 --> 00:01:49.980
AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER.

00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:51.248
NOW, THOSE DEMOCRATS ARE HEADING

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:52.516
THE OTHER WAY, SOME OF THEM EVEN

00:01:52.517 --> 00:01:54.051
WANT TO ELIMINATE THIS

00:01:54.052 --> 00:01:55.986
IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS

00:01:55.987 --> 00:01:56.387
ENFORCEMENT.

00:01:56.388 --> 00:01:58.055
MARIA: LIKE BY THE WAY

00:01:58.056 --> 00:01:58.756
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ KEEPS

00:01:58.757 --> 00:01:59.924
SAYING THAT LOOK WE OFTEN SHOW

00:01:59.925 --> 00:02:02.259
THIS PICTURE OF THE WALL THAT

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.761
SEPARATES SAN DIEGO AND TIJUANA.

00:02:03.762 --> 00:02:05.963
THIS IS A WALL IN NANCY PELOSI'S

00:02:05.964 --> 00:02:06.263
STATE.

00:02:06.264 --> 00:02:07.765
SHE'S NEVER ASKED ABOUT THE IDEA

00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:09.466
THAT, YOU KNOW, SHE KEEPS

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:10.701
CALLING WALL IMMORAL AND YET

00:02:10.702 --> 00:02:12.403
THERE'S A WALL IN HER OWN STATE

00:02:12.404 --> 00:02:14.939
WHICH OBVIOUSLY IS WORKING.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.073
I DON'T UNDERSTAND PLAYING

00:02:16.074 --> 00:02:17.308
POLITICS WITH THIS ISSUE.

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:19.410
IS THIS ALL ABOUT THE PRESIDENT

00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:21.545
GETTING HIS, YOU KNOW, CAMPAIGN

00:02:21.546 --> 00:02:23.547
PROMISE DELIVERED, KNOWING WHAT

00:02:23.548 --> 00:02:25.416
THE FACTS ARE IN TERMS OF THE

00:02:25.417 --> 00:02:27.551
HUMAN TRAFFICKING, THE DRUGS, ET

00:02:27.552 --> 00:02:27.885
CETERA?

00:02:27.886 --> 00:02:29.553
&gt;&gt;  WELL I THINK THE DAY THAT

00:02:29.554 --> 00:02:31.222
DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED

00:02:31.223 --> 00:02:31.989
PRESIDENT DEMOCRATS STILL

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.524
COULDN'T BELIEVE" AND THEY SAID

00:02:33.525 --> 00:02:35.059
WE'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING WE

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.128
CAN TO STOP HIM FROM

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:37.928
ACCOMPLISHING ANYTHING WHETHER

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:39.497
IT'S GOOD OR BAD FOR AMERICA.

00:02:39.498 --> 00:02:41.565
THAT DOES SEEM TO BE THE WAY

00:02:41.566 --> 00:02:42.900
THEY'VE HEADED CERTAINLY WITH

00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:43.801
BORDER SECURITY BECAUSE THEY

00:02:43.802 --> 00:02:45.269
HAVE FLIP FLOPPED THEY'RE NOW

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.971
AGAINST SOMETHING THEY'VE BEEN

00:02:46.972 --> 00:02:48.239
FOR AND VOTED FOR, IN THE PAST,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.508
AND THAT TO ME, IS THE MOST

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:51.609
DISTURBING NATURE OF ALL OF THIS

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.177
, BECAUSE WE NEED THE BORDER

00:02:53.178 --> 00:02:53.544
SECURITY.

00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:54.645
I JUST MET THIS OTHER DAY THE

00:02:54.646 --> 00:02:57.215
OTHER DAY WITH THE SECRETARY OF

00:02:57.216 --> 00:02:58.216
HOMELAND SECURITY, AND WE'RE ON

00:02:58.217 --> 00:03:01.152
A PATH TO HAVING A MILLION, A

00:03:01.153 --> 00:03:02.253
MILLION PEOPLE STOPPED AT THE

00:03:02.254 --> 00:03:03.821
BORDER TRYING TO COME INTO THE

00:03:03.822 --> 00:03:06.124
COUNTRY AND MANY GET HERE

00:03:06.125 --> 00:03:06.491
ILLEGALLY.

00:03:06.492 --> 00:03:08.226
WE'VE ALSO WEAPONIZED THE LAWS

00:03:08.227 --> 00:03:09.393
IN THE UNITED STATES WHEREAS

00:03:09.394 --> 00:03:10.695
WITH HUMAN TRAFFICKING IF THEY

00:03:10.696 --> 00:03:11.996
BRING A CHILD AND CALL

00:03:11.997 --> 00:03:13.798
THEMSELVES A FAMILY UNIT, THEN

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.800
THEY SAY THEY CAN ONLY BE HELD

00:03:15.801 --> 00:03:17.502
20 DAYS THAT'S WHAT THE LAW IS

00:03:17.503 --> 00:03:19.337
RELEASED INTO THE UNITED STATES,

00:03:19.338 --> 00:03:21.406
AND THEY DON'T COME BACK FOR A

00:03:21.407 --> 00:03:23.541
HEARING AND THEY STAY FOREVER SO

00:03:23.542 --> 00:03:25.944
OUR LAWS ARE BEING USED AGAINST

00:03:25.945 --> 00:03:27.445
US AND THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN.

00:03:27.446 --> 00:03:29.347
MARIA: OKAY SO THE SENATE VOTE

00:03:32.818 --> 00:03:34.319
REPUBLICANS TO GET IN WITH THEM.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.120
THE DEMOCRATS, SO THAT IT WILL

00:03:36.121 --> 00:03:37.589
PASS, AND THEN IT HEADS TO THE

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.123
PRESIDENT'S DESK HE SAID HE WILL

00:03:39.124 --> 00:03:39.724
VETO IT.

PRESIDENT.

00:03:52.071 --> 00:03:52.737

00:03:59.845 --> 00:04:01.980
IDEA THAT THIS IS A CRISIS RIGHT

00:04:01.981 --> 00:04:03.815

00:04:13.592 --> 00:04:15.994
&gt;&gt;  WELL HE'S ASKED THE EXPERTS

00:04:15.995 --> 00:04:17.195
WHERE SHOULD WE BE PUTTING OUR

00:04:17.196 --> 00:04:19.130
BEST EFFORTS AND THEY'VE COME UP

00:04:19.131 --> 00:04:20.131
WITH 10 SPECIFIC LOCATIONS ALONG

00:04:20.132 --> 00:04:22.167
THE BORDER AND SAID THESE ARE

00:04:22.168 --> 00:04:23.968
THE SPOTS WHERE IF WE COULD PUT

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:25.837
BARRIERS IT WOULD MAKE MAKE A

00:04:25.838 --> 00:04:26.438
FUNDAMENTAL SIGNIFICANT

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:29.174
DIFFERENCE IN PROTECTING THE

00:04:29.175 --> 00:04:31.009
BORDER, THE BORDER IS ABOUT

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.010
2,000 MILES AND SO THE PRESIDENT

00:04:32.011 --> 00:04:33.411
'S NOT ASKING FOR THE

00:04:33.412 --> 00:04:34.679
FULL 2,000 MILES HE'S SAYING

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.214
GIVE US THOSE 10 LOCATIONS THAT

00:04:36.215 --> 00:04:38.416

LOCATIONS, THAT'S WHERE HE'S

00:04:39.752 --> 00:04:40.852
GETTING HIS NUMBERS.

MARIA: YEAH BECAUSE THERE ARE

00:04:42.088 --> 00:04:43.321
SOME AREAS THAT MAY NOT NEED A

00:04:43.322 --> 00:04:45.023
WALL AND THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID

00:04:45.024 --> 00:04:45.323
THAT.

00:04:45.324 --> 00:04:46.358
&gt;&gt;  YES.

00:04:46.359 --> 00:04:48.460
YES, THERE ARE PLACES WHERE

00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:49.594
MANPOWER WORKS SOME PLACES BEST

00:04:49.595 --> 00:04:50.929
WITH TECHNOLOGY AND SOME PLACES

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.464
A PHYSICAL BARRIER IS KEY IT'S

00:04:52.465 --> 00:04:53.365
CRITICAL THAT'S WHAT THE

00:04:53.366 --> 00:04:54.466
PRESIDENT WANTS THE MONEY FOR.

00:04:54.467 --> 00:04:56.001
MARIA: HOW IS THIS GOING TO PLAY

00:04:56.002 --> 00:04:59.037

WANTS TO ACCOMPLISH AND THE

00:05:09.915 --> 00:05:10.915
PRESIDENT HAS DONE WONDERFUL

00:05:10.916 --> 00:05:12.050
THINGS FOR THE COUNTRY IN TERMS

00:05:12.051 --> 00:05:13.452

SECURITY IS A BIG BIG ISSUE.

00:05:32.472 --> 00:05:34.240
MARIA: YEAH, BORDER SECURITY

00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:35.808
WASN'T ALWAYS A BIG ISSUE FOR

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:36.108
THEM.

00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:38.611
THEY ALL SAY THAT THEY ARE FOR

00:05:38.612 --> 00:05:39.879
BORDER SECURITY AND THEY WANT

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.580
MORE TECHNOLOGY AND MORE

00:05:41.581 --> 00:05:42.381
MANPOWER THEY JUST DON'T LIKE

00:05:42.382 --> 00:05:43.716
THE IDEA OF A WALL.

00:05:43.717 --> 00:05:45.284
THEY WERE GOOD FOR THE FIRST 700

00:05:45.285 --> 00:05:45.317
THEY WERE GOOD FOR THE FIRST 70M

00:05:45.318 --> 00:05:45.351
THEY WERE GOOD FOR THE FIRST 70L

00:05:45.352 --> 00:05:45.618
THEY WERE GOOD FOR THE FIRST 70S

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:45.651
THEY WERE GOOD FOR THE FIRST 70A

00:05:45.652 --> 00:05:45.718
THEY WERE GOOD FOR THE FIRST 70D

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.751
THEY WERE GOOD FOR THE FIRST 70T

00:05:45.752 --> 00:05:45.785
THEY WERE GOOD FOR THE FIRST 70E

00:05:45.786 --> 00:05:45.885
THEY WERE GOOD FOR THE FIRST 70N

00:05:45.886 --> 00:05:45.918
THEY WERE GOOD FOR THE FIRST 70Y

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:45.951
THEY WERE GOOD FOR THE FIRST 70P

00:05:45.952 --> 00:05:45.985
THEY WERE GOOD FOR THE FIRST 70L

00:05:45.986 --> 00:05:46.018
THEY WERE GOOD FOR THE FIRST 70S

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:46.919
THEY WERE GOOD FOR THE FIRST 70I

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.889
CALLS IT A 701ST-MILE, IMMORAL.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:50.656
MARIA: YEAH, RIGHT.

00:05:50.657 --> 00:05:53.326
ALL RIGHT MET ME ASK YOU ABOUT

00:05:53.327 --> 00:05:54.694
THE BROADER SET OF ISSUES HERE

00:05:54.695 --> 00:05:55.962
WE'VE GOT THIS SOUTH BY

00:05:55.963 --> 00:06:00.066
SOUTHWEST CONFERENCE GOING ON

00:06:00.067 --> 00:06:00.800
AND ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ IS

00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:01.867
DEFENDING PER POSITION ON THE

00:06:01.868 --> 00:06:03.469
GREEN NEW DEAL BASICALLY SAYING

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.205
WHAT'S SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT

00:06:06.206 --> 00:06:08.174
GOING FROM 10% BETTER THAN

00:06:08.175 --> 00:06:08.507
GARBAGE.

00:06:08.508 --> 00:06:11.510
I MEAN, SHE ACTUALLY CALLED THE

00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:14.146
U.S. POLICIES RIGHT NOW GARBAGE.

00:06:14.147 --> 00:06:15.481
HOW DO YOU REACT TO THAT?

00:06:15.482 --> 00:06:16.949
&gt;&gt;  WELL THIS NEW DEAL IT'S A

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:17.617
CRAZY NEW DEAL.

00:06:17.618 --> 00:06:19.919
IT'S A BAD DEAL.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.554
I'D TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THEY

00:06:21.555 --> 00:06:23.189
PROPOSED WHAT SHE HAS INTRODUCED

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.124
AND 11 MEMBERS OF THE SENATE

00:06:25.125 --> 00:06:26.426
HAVE IS WHAT'S THE COST, WHAT

00:06:26.427 --> 00:06:28.294
ARE THE CONSEQUENCES AND WILL IT

00:06:28.295 --> 00:06:28.594
WORK?

00:06:28.595 --> 00:06:31.731
WELL THE COST IS STAGGERING,

00:06:31.732 --> 00:06:33.232
ASTRONOMICAL.

00:06:33.233 --> 00:06:33.666
$93 TRILLION.

00:06:33.667 --> 00:06:35.668
THAT WOULD EMPTY EVERYONE'S BANK

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:36.903
ACCOUNT IN AMERICA FROM WARREN

00:06:36.904 --> 00:06:38.204
BUFFETT ALL THE WAY ON DOWN, SO

00:06:38.205 --> 00:06:40.440
THE COUNTRY CANNOT AFFORD IT.

00:06:40.441 --> 00:06:42.508
INDIVIDUALLY, THE CONSEQUENCES

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:43.676
ARE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOSE

00:06:43.677 --> 00:06:46.546
THEIR JOBS AND IT'S GOING TO BE

00:06:46.547 --> 00:06:47.947
ABOUT $65,000 PER FAMILY PER

00:06:47.948 --> 00:06:49.982
YEAR PLUS HIGHER ENERGY COSTS,

00:06:49.983 --> 00:06:51.017
HIGHER HEATING COSTS.

00:06:51.018 --> 00:06:52.518
THEY WANT TO GET RID OF

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:54.053
AIRPLANES, ANYBODY THAT WORKS IN

00:06:54.054 --> 00:06:55.455
AN AIRLINE INDUSTRY THEY'RE

00:06:55.456 --> 00:06:56.589
GOING TO BE OUT OF WORK.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.324
THE ENERGY INDUSTRY OUT OF WORK

00:06:58.325 --> 00:06:59.525
AND WHAT ABOUT THE AIR FORCE?

00:06:59.526 --> 00:07:00.927
YOU GET RID OF AIRPLANES,

00:07:00.928 --> 00:07:02.028
VLADIMIR PUTIN IS NOT GOING TO

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:03.896
GET RID OF HIS AIR FORCE JUST IF

00:07:03.897 --> 00:07:05.431
WE GET RID OF OURS AND THE

00:07:05.432 --> 00:07:07.967
QUESTION OF WILL IT WORK, MARIA,

00:07:07.968 --> 00:07:09.402
IT WILL NOT WORK.

00:07:09.403 --> 00:07:10.903
WE CANNOT ALLOW IT.

00:07:10.904 --> 00:07:13.239
MARIA: I WANT TO REITERATE YOUR

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.074
KNOWLEDGE BASE COMING AT THIS,

00:07:15.075 --> 00:07:16.442
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE CHAIRMAN OF

00:07:16.443 --> 00:07:17.410
THE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND

00:07:17.411 --> 00:07:18.712
PUBLIC WORKS.

00:07:18.713 --> 00:07:20.247
YOU ARE AN AUTHOR IT TATE EVER

00:07:20.248 --> 00:07:23.483

IN THIS CAPACITY AND URLS A

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.854
BOARD-CERTIFIED ORTHOPAEDIC

24 YEARS SO YOU HAVE REAL

00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:31.725
OPINIONS IN TERMS OF MEDICARE

00:07:31.726 --> 00:07:32.826
AND MEDICAID.

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:34.161
WHY WON'T IT WORK?

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:35.862
EXPLAIN TO OUR VIEWERS, BASED ON

00:07:35.863 --> 00:07:37.197
YOUR KNOWLEDGE BASE.

00:07:37.198 --> 00:07:40.233
&gt;&gt;  WELL, RIGHT NOW, IN TERMS OF

00:07:40.234 --> 00:07:41.568
EMISSIONS, GLOBAL EMISSIONS AND

00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:44.704
A GLOBAL ISSUE THE UNITED STATES

00:07:44.705 --> 00:07:46.540
PUTS FORTH ONLY 13% OF THOSE.

00:07:46.541 --> 00:07:49.676
CHINA AND INDIA, 33%, SO YOU

00:07:49.677 --> 00:07:52.212
CAN'T POWER THE COUNTRY ON WIND

00:07:52.213 --> 00:07:54.548
TURBINES AND SOLAR PANELS ALONE.

00:07:54.549 --> 00:07:57.184
THAT'S ONLY 8% OF OUR ENERGY, WE

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:58.752
JUST CANNOT ALLOW "OUR BODIES,

00:07:58.753 --> 00:08:01.555
OURSELVES" TO FOLLOW THIS

00:08:01.556 --> 00:08:03.457
CHICKEN LITTLE, SKY IS FALLING

00:08:03.458 --> 00:08:04.891
APPROACH OF THESE SOCIALISTIC

00:08:04.892 --> 00:08:07.394
DEMOCRATS LIKE OCASIO-CORTEZ AND

00:08:07.395 --> 00:08:08.662
THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ON

00:08:08.663 --> 00:08:10.464
THE DEMOCRAT SIDE OF THE AISLE.

00:08:10.465 --> 00:08:12.199
WE CANNOT FOLLOW THEM OVER THE

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:12.499
CLIFF.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.135
IT IS GOING TO HURT JOBS, HURT

00:08:15.136 --> 00:08:16.937
PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO PAY THEIR

00:08:16.938 --> 00:08:18.372
MORTGAGE, HURT OUR ECONOMY, HURT

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:22.843
OUR NATION IN TERMS OF NATIONAL

00:08:22.844 --> 00:08:23.210
SECURITY.

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:24.544
IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING

00:08:24.545 --> 00:08:25.245
ACTUALLY SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT

00:08:25.246 --> 00:08:26.513
AND BIG THERE ARE SOME SOLUTIONS

00:08:26.514 --> 00:08:28.348
TO THIS THAT I PROPOSE AND I'M

00:08:28.349 --> 00:08:29.850
WORKING WITH PEOPLE ON A

00:08:29.851 --> 00:08:31.051
BIPARTISAN WAY ON IT.

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:33.086
SURE WE NEED MORE RENEWABLE

00:08:33.087 --> 00:08:35.322
ENERGY, BUT WE NEED CARBON

00:08:35.323 --> 00:08:37.057
CAPTURES, SEQUESTRATION,

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:39.259
UTILIZING THE CARBON, MAKE IT A

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:39.760
VALUABLE PRODUCT.

00:08:39.761 --> 00:08:41.728
WE PASSED PIECES OF LEGISLATION,

00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:43.163
SIGNED INTO LAW, CALLED THE

00:08:43.164 --> 00:08:44.965
FUTURE ACT AND WE HAD A HEARING

00:08:44.966 --> 00:08:46.801
ON ANOTHER ONE YESTERDAY, ALL

00:08:46.802 --> 00:08:49.237
RELATED TO LAST WEEK ALL RELATED

00:08:49.238 --> 00:08:50.872
TO CARBON CAPTURE, AND THE OTHER

00:08:50.873 --> 00:08:52.907
IS NUCLEAR POWER.

00:08:52.908 --> 00:08:54.308
NEW AGE NUCLEAR POWER WHERE THE

00:08:54.309 --> 00:08:56.143
REACT ORS ARE SMALLER, BETTER,

00:08:56.144 --> 00:08:57.812
SAFER THAT'S ALL PART OF IT.

00:08:57.813 --> 00:08:59.380
MARIA: I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED

00:08:59.381 --> 00:09:00.615
ALL OF THIS BECAUSE YOU'VE

00:09:00.616 --> 00:09:01.816
WORKED WITH YOUR DEMOCRATIC

00:09:01.817 --> 00:09:03.784
COLLEAGUES ON THIS, AND YOU'VE

00:09:03.785 --> 00:09:05.586
RECOGNIZED CLIMATE CHANGE AS AN

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:05.887
ISSUE.

00:09:05.888 --> 00:09:07.121
DO YOU THINK SHE JUST DOESN'T

00:09:07.122 --> 00:09:08.389
UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES?

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.359
I MEAN, HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.594
THE PARTY SEEMS TO BE BEING LED

00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:15.730
BY HER AND HER IDEAS, THE WHOLE

00:09:15.731 --> 00:09:16.664
CONVERSATION, THE DEBATE THAT

00:09:16.665 --> 00:09:18.900
WE'RE HAVING IS BASED ON HER

00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:19.200
IDEAS.

00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:20.601
WHAT ARE YOUR COLLEAGUES ON THE

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:22.336
LEFT SAY ABOUT THIS?

00:09:22.337 --> 00:09:23.771
&gt;&gt;  WELL SOME ARE VERY CONCERNED

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:25.406
WITH THE POSITION THAT THE PARTY

00:09:25.407 --> 00:09:27.909
HAS TAKEN AND THE PRESIDENTIAL

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:29.143
CANDIDATES HAVE TAKEN.

00:09:29.144 --> 00:09:31.145
I THINK NANCY PELOSI IS UNNERVED

00:09:31.146 --> 00:09:33.381
BY THIS NEW GROUP OF DEMOCRATS

00:09:33.382 --> 00:09:34.916
IN THE HOUSE, WHO ARE TRYING TO

00:09:34.917 --> 00:09:37.685
TAKE THE ENTIRE PARTY AND ARE

00:09:37.686 --> 00:09:39.086
SUCCEEDING IN TAKING THE PARTY

00:09:39.087 --> 00:09:40.888
ON THIS SHARP LEFT HAND TURN

00:09:40.889 --> 00:09:43.425
THAT'S GOING TO AS THE NEW YORK
