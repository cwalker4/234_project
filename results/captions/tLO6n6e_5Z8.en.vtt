00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.068
The President: Thank
you all very much.

00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:04.070
I appreciate
you being here.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.406
We have a number of bills
that we're signing and

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:07.774
things that we're
doing today.

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:08.675
It's a busy day.

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:10.477
And then I guess tonight
will be a rather

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:11.878
busy night.

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:12.445
We look forward to it.

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:15.215
I want to thank Majority
Leader Kevin McCarthy, who

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:18.251
has been a tremendous
friend to a lot of people.

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:19.786
He's done an amazing job.

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:22.822
And, Kevin, I want to
thank you for being here.

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:24.357
I very much appreciate it.

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:26.860
You had so much
to do with this.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.262
I also want to thank
everyone else who's

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:30.530
with us today.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.599
In fact, I have some
names, and I'll read some

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.902
of them off, because not
everybody knows everybody.

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:38.138
But we have
Leader McCarthy.

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:41.441
Representative
Barbara Comstock.

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.443
Lamar Smith -- thank
you, Lamar, very much.

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:44.844
I appreciate it.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.313
Joni Ernst, who's been
a terrific,

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:48.181
terrific senator.

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:51.718
A very talented woman,
and a very good

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:52.585
military person.

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:54.788
A very good
military person.

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:57.891
And, Deb Fischer,
thank you very much.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:58.558
Thanks.

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:01.661
We also have Senator
Barrasso and

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:03.897
Senator Boozman.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.633
Joni, we said hello.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:07.434
Deb, we said hello.

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:10.670
Heidi Heitkamp --
thank you, Heidi.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.572
Senator Jim Inhofe.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:13.973
Senator Pat Roberts.

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:15.942
Senator Dan Sullivan.

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:17.911
Representative Bob Gibbs.

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:18.745
Bill Shuster.

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.814
And Representative
Lamar Smith.

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:23.917
We really appreciate
you being here.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:28.555
Of course, we have our
new SBA Director, Linda

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:30.657
McMahon, and
Secretary DeVos.

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:31.324
(Applause.)

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:35.462
So we have a lot of great talent.

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:37.764
Today I'm signing two
bills that promote women

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:41.267
entering and leading the
STEM fields -- science,

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:45.138
technology,
engineering, and math.

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:48.341
Currently, only 1 in every
4 women who gets a STEM

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:51.711
degree is working in a
STEM job, which is not

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:54.714
fair and it's not even
smart for the people that

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:56.516
aren't taking
advantage of it.

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:59.419
It's unacceptable that
we have so many American

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:02.088
women who have these
degrees but yet are not

00:02:02.088 --> 00:02:03.590
being employed
in these fields.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.425
So I think that's
going to change.

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:06.993
That's going to
change very rapidly.

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:09.295
Protecting women with STEM
degrees, and all Americans

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:12.332
with STEM degrees is very
important, but it also

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:15.201
means you have to crack
down on offshoring,

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:19.038
because the offshoring is
a tremendous problem that

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:23.042
displaces many of our
best American workers and

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:25.178
brains -- the brain power.

00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:27.146
So I just want to thank
you all for being here.

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:30.250
Vice President Pence
always felt very, very

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.285
strongly about this
issue and many others.

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:33.887
And I appreciate -- Mike,
I appreciate

00:02:33.887 --> 00:02:34.787
that very much.

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:37.390
And I'm going to sign this
right now, and I

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.659
want congratulate
everybody in the room.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.361
And we have to
sign it today.

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:43.596
I know we have a lot of
things coming on later on,

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:45.765
but if we don't sign this
one and the next one

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.268
today, we have to start
the process all over

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:49.335
again, Joni, right?

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:52.071
(Laughter.)

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:55.108
So that's
why we're here.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.515
Okay, thank you very much.

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:10.790
(Applause.)

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:17.564
The Press;
Big speech tonight?

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:19.232
The President: We
look forward to it.

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:33.012
Okay, I think we all
know what this is.

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:34.447
Even though somebody took
my notes, it makes

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:35.081
no difference.

00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:36.316
(Laughter.)

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:36.950
Aide: It's
the second bill

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:37.450
you just read.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.019
The President: It really
makes no difference.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.489
But this is the second
bill that was signed, and

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:44.257
that's the H.R.

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:49.162
321, the INSPIRE
Women Act.

00:03:49.162 --> 00:03:52.198
It ensures that the
existing NASA programs

00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:55.868
recruit women to
STEM-related jobs and

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:57.470
aerospace careers.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.105
Great news.

00:03:59.105 --> 00:03:59.906
Really the way to go.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.841
Very heavy into the
whole NASA situation.

00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:06.980
So women will be a
big, big part of it. H.R.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.482
255, the Promoting Women
in Entrepreneurship Act,

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:11.584
enables the National
Science Foundation to

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:15.655
support women inventors --
which there are many --

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:17.790
researchers, and
scientists in bringing

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.927
their discoveries to
the business world,

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:23.296
championing science and
entrepreneurship, and

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:27.800
creating new ways to
improve people's lives.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.302
So important.

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:31.571
We need policies that
help support women in the

00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:34.741
workforce, and that's
really very much going to

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:36.776
be addressed by my
administration over the

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:40.446
years, and to get more and
more of these bills coming

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:43.783
out, and address the
barriers faced by female

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:47.220
and those in STEM fields.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.589
We want American women who
graduate from college with

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:53.493
STEM degrees to be able
to get STEM jobs that can

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:56.262
support their families and
help these American women

00:04:56.262 --> 00:04:59.432
to live out the American
Dream, which they are so

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:01.200
qualified to live out.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.970
So again, I want to thank
you all for being here.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.104
Fantastic.

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:07.106
This is so important.

00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:07.907
Thank you all
for being here.

00:05:23.556 --> 00:05:33.466
Thank you folks.

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:35.334
Thank you all very much.

00:05:35.334 --> 00:05:39.238
(applause)
