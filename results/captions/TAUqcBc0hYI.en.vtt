Welcoem to the new era of American leadership in space.

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:44.811
You know its the greatest privledge of my life to serve as

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:51.351
Vice President to a President who gets up everyday to

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:54.220

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.056
In his his inagural address President Trump recommitted

00:00:57.056 --> 00:00:58.358

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:02.796

With the action he takes today, President Trump will bring a

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:15.708
renewed sense of purpose to Americas space policy

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:19.212
that will benefit litterally every facet of our national life

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:22.248
Just like its done in the past and im honored and frankly

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:25.885
enthusiastic about the role that the President has asked me to 

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:28.154
play in renewing our Nations Commitment to space. 

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:31.191
By the Presidents actions we will strengthen our economy, we

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:33.693
will unlock new opportunies new technologies and new

00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:34.961
sources of prosperity.

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:38.198
It will inspire our children to seek eduction in science 

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:39.799
technology, engineering and math.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.769
It will enhance our common defense and advance the security 

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:43.603
of the American people. 

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:47.440
But most of all, under President Donald Trump American

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.378
leadership in space will strengthen the American spirit.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:55.482
Today, President Trump recommits,and so says the nation

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:58.117

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:02.355

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:10.363

leadership here on Earth and in the boundless expanse of space, 

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:12.365
it is now my high honor and

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:13.700
distinct privledge to introduce to all of you, the President

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.034
of The United States of America. President Donal Trump. 

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:16.369
Th President: Thank
you, very much.

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:17.871
You don't mind
if I do that?

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:20.173
Get rid of it.

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:20.874
(Laughter.)

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:25.845
Thank you very much to our
great Vice President and

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:32.886
also for the fantastic job
that Mike has been doing.

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.783
The future of American
space leadership -- we're

00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:05.118
going to lead again.

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:05.985
It's been a long time.

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:09.989
It's over 25 years, and
we're opening up, and we

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.691
are going to be leading
again like

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:12.959
we've never led before.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.695
We're a nation of
pioneers, and the next

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:19.198
great American
frontier is space.

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:21.134
And we never completed --
we started,

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:22.335
but we never completed.

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:23.703
We stopped.

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:24.837
But now we start again.

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:27.006
And we have tremendous
spirit, and we're going to

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:30.810
have tremendous spirit
from the private sector --

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.145
maybe in particular from
the private sector.

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:34.080
I'd like to extend a
special welcome to an

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.249
American hero who've I've
known actually for a long

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:39.752
time, Buzz Aldrin,
who is with us today.

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:44.757
(Applause.)

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:49.829
Known him a long time.

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.199
Thank you also to
Astronauts Benjamin Drew

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.736
and David Wolf and former
NASA Flight Director Gene

00:03:56.736 --> 00:04:00.607
Kranz for being with us
and for working with us on

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:02.008
exactly what
we're doing today.

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:03.009
Thank you all very much.

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.810
We appreciate it.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.414
Thank you, thank
you, thank you.

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:10.483
(Applause.)

00:04:10.483 --> 00:04:12.518
We're also joined by
our great Secretary of

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:15.254
Commerce, Wilbur Ross,
who spent the morning

00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:18.424
negotiating trade deals
with South Korea.

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:20.760
And as you know, that
trade deal is coming due,

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.862
and it actually came due
a couple of weeks ago.

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:24.197
And I think we're going to
make a good deal, right?

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:25.565
Secretry Ross: We've
made some progress.

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:26.232
The President: I think so.

00:04:26.232 --> 00:04:26.899
That's what the word is.

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:31.204
And good for
both countries.

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:34.440
Also distinguished members
of Congress are with us,

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.576
and leaders of several of
America's great

00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:38.344
aerospace companies.

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:41.214
Today, we're taking a
crucial step to secure

00:04:41.214 --> 00:04:45.184
America's future in space
by reviving the National

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:49.255
Space Council after it was
-- has been dormant almost

00:04:49.255 --> 00:04:51.724
25 years if you
can believe it.

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:55.461
During the campaign, Vice
President Pence promised

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:59.065
that our administration --
because Mike is very much

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:02.335
into space -- would
revive the National Space

00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:05.738
Council, and with this
executive order, we're

00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:08.007
keeping that promise.

00:05:08.007 --> 00:05:09.275
Feel very
strongly about it.

00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:11.978
I've felt strongly about
it for a long time.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:15.048
I used to say before doing
what I did -- I used to

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:16.549
say, what happened?

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:18.885
Why aren't we
moving forward?

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:21.421
Today's announcement sends
a clear signal to the

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:24.023
world that we are
restoring America's proud

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:28.027
legacy of
leadership in space.

00:05:28.027 --> 00:05:30.797
Our Vice President cares
very deeply about space

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:33.900
policy, and for good
reason -- space

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.904
exploration is not only
essential to our character

00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:42.075
as a nation, but also our
economy and our great

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:44.844
nation's security.

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:47.346
Our travels beyond the
Earth propel scientific

00:05:47.346 --> 00:05:50.950
discoveries that improve
our lives in countless

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.887
ways here, right here, at
home: powering vast new

00:05:54.887 --> 00:05:57.890
industry, spurring
incredible new technology,

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.160
and providing the space
security we need to

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.695
protect the
American people.

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:05.865
And security is going to
be a very big factor with

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:10.470
respect to space and
space exploration.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.038
At some point in the
future, we're going to

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:16.476
look back and say how did
we do it without space?

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:19.812
The Vice President will
serve as the council's chair.

00:06:19.812 --> 00:06:22.515
Several representatives
of my administration will

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:25.718
join him including the
Secretaries of State,

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:28.020
Defense, Commerce,
Transportation, and

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.025
Homeland Security; the
Chairman of the great --

00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:35.294
I'll tell you, he's doing
a fantastic job, always

00:06:35.294 --> 00:06:38.831
working, always fighting,
and winning -- winning big

00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:40.933
against ISIS, that I can
tell you, seeing what's

00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:43.569
happening there -- the
Chairman of the Joint

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:47.607
Chiefs of Staff, the
National Security Advisor,

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:52.779
NASA, and the Director of
National Intelligence.

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:55.448
The council will also draw
the expertise of other

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:58.651
White House offices as
well as insights from

00:06:58.651 --> 00:07:02.155
scientists, innovators,
and business leaders from

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:03.055
across the country.

00:07:03.055 --> 00:07:05.224
Many business leaders that
want to be a big part of this.

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:08.060
I think the privatization
of certain aspects is

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.731
going to play a very
crucial role,

00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:13.366
don't you think?

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:16.335
They are truly into it.

00:07:16.335 --> 00:07:18.571
This coordination will be
accomplished through an

00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:21.207
advisory group that is
being convened by today's

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:24.243
executive order, which
I'll be signing in a minute.

00:07:24.243 --> 00:07:27.780
The National Space Council
will be a central hub

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.150
guiding space policy
within the administration.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.087
And I will draw on it for
advice and information and

00:07:35.087 --> 00:07:37.723
recommendations
for action.

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:40.026
And the Vice President,
myself, and a few others

00:07:40.026 --> 00:07:41.661
are going to pick some
private people to

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:43.129
be on the board.

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:46.065
I will say that's not easy
because everybody wants to

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:46.833
be on this board.

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:50.736
People that you wouldn't
have believed loved what

00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:52.572
we're doing so much they
want to -- some of the

00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:54.407
most successful people in
the world want to

00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:56.409
be on this board.

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:58.377
The human soul
yearns for discovery.

00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:02.515
By unlocking the mysteries
of the universe, we unlock

00:08:02.515 --> 00:08:03.883
truths within ourselves.

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:05.418
That's true.

00:08:05.418 --> 00:08:07.587
Our journey into space
will not only make us

00:08:07.587 --> 00:08:10.823
stronger and more
prosperous, but will unite

00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:14.126
us behind grand ambitions
and bring us

00:08:14.126 --> 00:08:15.628
all closer together.

00:08:15.628 --> 00:08:17.330
Wouldn't that be nice?

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.933
Can you believe that space
is going to do that?

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:22.435
I thought politics
would do that.

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:23.135
(Laughter.)

00:08:23.135 --> 00:08:25.438
Well, we'll have to rely on space instead.

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:27.673
Every launch into the
skies is another step

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:30.142
forward toward a future
where our differences seem

00:08:30.142 --> 00:08:33.646
small against the vast
expanse of

00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:36.716
our common humanity.

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:40.186
Sometimes you have to view
things from a distance in

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:43.122
order to see
the real truth.

00:08:43.122 --> 00:08:47.326
It is America's destiny
to be at the forefront of

00:08:47.326 --> 00:08:51.264
humanity's eternal quest
for knowledge and to be

00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:55.468
the leader amongst nations
on our adventure

00:08:55.468 --> 00:08:57.970
into the great unknown.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.639
And I could say the
great and very

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:01.340
beautiful unknown.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.909
Nothing more beautiful.

00:09:02.909 --> 00:09:06.545
With the actions we are
launching today, America

00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:09.982
will think big once again.

00:09:09.982 --> 00:09:12.785
Important words:
Think big.

00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:17.123
We haven't been thinking
so big for a long time,

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:20.126
but we're thinking big
again as a county.

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:24.130
We will inspire millions
of children to carry on

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:28.467
this proud tradition of
American space leadership

00:09:28.467 --> 00:09:31.170
-- and they're excited
-- and to never stop

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:35.174
wondering, hoping, and
dreaming about what lies

00:09:35.174 --> 00:09:37.810
beyond the stars.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:41.280
So, I just want to tell
you that we are now going

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.550
to sign an executive
order, and this is going

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:48.921
to launch a whole new
chapter for our great country.

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:51.157
And people are very
excited about it and I can

00:09:51.157 --> 00:09:52.758
tell you, I'm very
excited about it.

00:10:47.346 --> 00:10:49.281
Thank you all very much.

00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:49.949
(Applause.)

00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:51.584
Colonel Aldrin:
Infinity and beyond.

00:10:51.584 --> 00:10:52.251
(Laughter.)

00:10:52.251 --> 00:10:54.253
The President: This
is infinity here.

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:55.788
It could be infinity.

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:57.723
We don't really
don't know.

00:10:57.723 --> 00:10:59.258
But it could be.

00:10:59.258 --> 00:11:03.863
It has to be something --
but it could be infinity, right?

00:11:03.863 --> 00:11:04.530
Okay.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:04.797
(Applause.)
