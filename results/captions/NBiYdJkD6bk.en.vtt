[MUSING PLAYING]

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.640
NARRATOR: This program is
about unsolved mysteries.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.640
Whenever possible, the
actual family members

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.590
and police officials
have participated

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.220
in recreating the events.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.520
What you are about to see
is not a news broadcast.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.400
 Tonight, all new stories
on the season premiere

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.060
of Unsolved Mysteries.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.080
ROBERT STACK: In the 1980s,
one UFO sighting after another,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.990
numbering into the thousands,
astounded residents of New

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.795
York's Hudson River Valley.

00:00:35.795 --> 00:00:39.210
A controversy boiled over
when maverick stunt pilots

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.010
claimed they were
responsible for the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.430
spectacular light formations.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.270
When she was just 17, Tammy
Lynn Leppert had it all.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.670
She was a beauty queen,
an accomplished model,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.910
and was well on her way
to a career in the movies.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.940
But in 1982, Tammy
began to withdraw,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.930
growing increasingly paranoid,
until finally, she vanished.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.209
In Paducah, Kentucky,
a young stranger

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.745
was seen loitering at the
local airport, penniless,

00:01:06.745 --> 00:01:09.520
and trying to talk
his way onto a flight.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.590
People still wonder
what drove him

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.180
to make the desperate decision
that would end his life.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.170
Join me for these intriguing
stories on our season premier.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.750
Perhaps you may be able
to help solve a mystery.

[APPLAUSE]

00:02:18.911 --> 00:02:25.166
PAGEANT HOST: Tammy is 16
years old, is 5'4 1/2--

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:29.410
ROBERT STACK: 1982, the Miss
America Sunshine Surf Beauty

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.990
Pageant in Orlando, Florida.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.230
The eventual winner will
be Tammy Lynn Leppert.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.930
Incredibly, at the
age of 16, Tammy

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.800
has already competed in more
than 300 beauty contests.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.958
She has won the crown 280 times.

00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.040
LINDA CURTIS: She
was very loving,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.680
kind, she was always smiling.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.800
You never saw the child
when she wasn't smiling.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.660
When As young as I can
remember, she woke up

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.310
with a great big smile
and the last thing

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.180
I saw before she went to
sleep was a big smile.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.380
ROBERT STACK: Tammy
Lynn Leppert was

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.750
an uncommonly beautiful child.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.590
When she was just
four years old,

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.650
she was entered in her
first beauty contest.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.110
Tammy's mother and father
divorced when she was seven.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.080
Her fledgling career
fell to the tender

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.170
loving care of her mother, who
was a theatrical and modeling

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.835
agent.

00:03:19.835 --> 00:03:22.130
LINDA CURTIS: I was
constantly busy running her

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.070
around to where she had to
go and what she had to do,

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.730
and I enjoyed it.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.060
I enjoyed watching
her excel, because she

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.360
always went for the best
that she could go for,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.826
the highest level.

00:03:34.826 --> 00:03:37.580
ROBERT STACK: Wing Flanagan,
one of Linda's client's,

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.130
was just 11 when he began
living at her house.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.501
 I have to blot my lipstick.

00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:44.135
ROBERT STACK: He and Tammy
were like brother and sister.

00:03:44.135 --> 00:03:45.230
 I'm trying to watch TV.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.130
 Yeah.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.010
WING FLANAGAN: She would bend
over and kiss me on the cheek,

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.500
and I couldn't quite ever
get it completely off.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.446
 Mom, I'm leaving.

00:03:52.446 --> 00:03:54.980
WING FLANAGAN: It was
rather embarrassing to walk

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.810
around with this mark.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.640
But I think, actually,
I learned to wear

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.680
it proudly after a
while, because it

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.710
was almost a status symbol.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.350
Tammy.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.170
ROBERT STACK: In July
of 1982, Tammy Lynn

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.870
was cast in the teen
exploitation Film, Spring

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.900
Break, which would go on
to earn nearly $25 million

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.089
at the box office.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:21.269
After Spring Break, Tammy
went unchaperoned to an out

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.010
of town weekend party.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.140
She came back a
different person.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.870
WING FLANAGAN:
Sometimes I'd ask her,

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.930
you know, what was on her mind,
if anything was bothering her.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.840
And she'd usually
evade the question.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.670
She change the subject, or she'd
say, oh, nothing, you know,

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.266
and then try to laugh it off.

00:04:41.266 --> 00:04:42.544
[PHONE RINGING]

00:04:42.544 --> 00:04:44.860
ROBERT STACK: Soon,
Tammy's behavior began

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.120
to take on paranoid overtones.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.020
[PHONE RINGING]

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.920
 I'm not here.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.330
Don't tell anybody I'm here.
- Why?

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.288
 Just do it.

00:04:51.188 --> 00:04:53.560

Hello?

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.260
MAN (ON PHONE): Hi,
is Tammy Lynn there?

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.890
 No.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:58.850
She's not here right now.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.283
MAN (ON PHONE): She's out?
- Yeah.

00:05:00.283 --> 00:05:01.316
MAN (ON PHONE): I'll call back.

00:05:01.316 --> 00:05:02.390
 All right.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.990
Bye.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.300
Happy now?
- Tammy.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.300
What's the problem?

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.262
Honey, talk to me.

00:05:12.262 --> 00:05:13.660
Tammy?

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.385
- I saw something awful.
- What?

00:05:16.385 --> 00:05:17.960
 Something really bad.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.210
 Honey, what did you see?

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.470
 I wasn't supposed to see it.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.610
LINDA CURTIS: She said that
she saw something so horrible

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.830
that she couldn't talk about it.
- Sweetheart, talk to me.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:34.100
 And she said, "Mom, what would
you say if I told you somebody

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.311
was trying to kill me?"

00:05:36.311 --> 00:05:38.260
- What are you talking about?
- I wasn't supposed to say this.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.880
- Tammy.
- I can't tell anybody.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.490
 What do you mean,
you can't tell anybody?

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.450
LINDA CURTIS: I kept trying
to find out who "they" were.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.465
 Tammy, talk to me.

00:05:45.465 --> 00:05:47.165
LINDA CURTIS (OFF SCREEN):
She never would tell me.

00:05:47.165 --> 00:05:48.065
 Tammy?

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.860
ROBERT STACK: Tammy Lynn began
a steady retreat into isolation.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.350
Linda and Wing had no
way of ascertaining

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.480
which of Tammy's
fears were real,

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.316
and which were
paranoid delusions.

00:06:06.316 --> 00:06:09.250
WING FLANAGAN: Once, she
called me over to the window.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.835
She said, "Look across the
street, tell me what you see."

00:06:11.835 --> 00:06:14.640
I said, "Well, the
neighbors got a new van."

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.238
And she said, "Exactly."

00:06:17.238 --> 00:06:22.610
And I didn't know quite
what she was getting at.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.790
And she said, "The van
has mirrored windows.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.280
That means that they can see
us but we can't see them."

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:39.130
ROBERT STACK: After two
weeks of virtual seclusion,

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.245
Tammy Lynn was offered a small
part in the big budget Al

00:06:42.245 --> 00:06:44.710
Pacino film, Scarface,
which began shooting

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.800
in Miami in March of 1983.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.920
She stayed with a family
friend, Walter Leibowitz.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.756
All went well until the
fourth day of filming.

00:06:54.756 --> 00:06:58.300
WALTER LEIBOWITZ: I received a
call from the casting director

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.230
to tell me that Tammy had
a breakdown on the set.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.630
They said that there was
a scene where someone

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.520
was supposed to
be shot, and they

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.890
had artificial blood spurt out.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.770
And they said when Tammy
was watching the scene,

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.190
she started crying hysterically,
and it got so bad that they

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.810
had her take her to a trailer.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:20.710
[TAMMY CRYING]

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:21.930
 Tammy, what's happened?

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.272
 They're gonna kill me.

00:07:23.272 --> 00:07:24.685
 Who's gonna kill you?

00:07:24.685 --> 00:07:25.630
 They're gonna kill me.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.480
WALTER LEIBOWITZ: She
was in a tremendous state

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.195
of fear, anxiety.

00:07:30.195 --> 00:07:31.975
 Who is going to hurt you?

00:07:31.975 --> 00:07:32.905
Who's trying to hurt you?

00:07:32.905 --> 00:07:34.582
 They're gonna
blow my head off.

00:07:34.582 --> 00:07:38.230
WALTER LEIBOWITZ: Hysterically,
crying, saying something

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:39.820
about money laundering.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:40.720
I don't know where to hide.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.502
Things of that nature.

00:07:42.502 --> 00:07:44.850
 I'm so scared.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:45.750
 Tammy.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:46.740
Look at me.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.170
WALTER LEIBOWITZ: What it was
that caused this great fear

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.750
in her, I don't know.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.940
When I spoke with
Tammy's mother,

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.030
I told her that she should
take Tammy to a doctor,

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.850
and also take her to the police,
to find out if the problem was

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.090
psychological, or if there
was some basis in fact

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.130
that someone was actually
trying to kill her,

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.034
and get to the bottom of it.

00:08:09.034 --> 00:08:10.780
LINDA CURTIS: Tammy
Lynn quit the film

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.850
and went back to Cocoa Beach.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.530
At her mother's
insistence, Tammy

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.260
did talk to the local
sheriff, but apparently

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.110
never mentioned that she
felt her life was in danger.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.200
Even with her family,
Tammy's paranoia ran rampant.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.120
She became convinced
that someone

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.408
was trying to poison her.

00:08:33.408 --> 00:08:35.376
 Taste this.

00:08:35.376 --> 00:08:36.515
 Why?

00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:38.700
 Just do it.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.670
 Fine.

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:55.050
WING FLANAGAN: There were good
days and there were bad days.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.470
There were days when she
was almost normal, almost.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.485
And there were other days
when she was real edgy.

00:09:01.485 --> 00:09:04.830
LINDA CURTIS: She was not
the Tammy that we know.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:10.000
We did not recognize this
Tammy in personality.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.840
She even begin to take
on a different look.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.100
Kind of a wild look in
her eyes, and scared look,

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.000
is what it was.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.010
And if she really
believed that somebody

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:23.340
was going to try to kill
her, scared of the feeling

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.535
that we were seeing.

00:09:25.535 --> 00:09:30.150
ROBERT STACK: On July 1st, 1983,
Tammy Lynn finally snapped.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.791
 What are you looking at?

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.530
What are you looking at?

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:37.556
 Not you.

00:09:37.556 --> 00:09:39.440
 I saw you looking at me.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.340
 Why would I look at you?

then it was the last time

at her home in
Rockledge, Florida,

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.670

And we talked to
him, and he basically

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:03.120
stated that they'd become
involved in a verbal argument,

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.730
that she had
requested that he let

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:10.380
her out near the glass bank in
Cocoa Beach, and he complied.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.510

that was the last person

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:13.560

We talked to some of
her close friends.

They felt strongly that Tammy
was having problems at home,

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.720
and that she had left home,
that she wanted to leave home.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.010
LINDA CURTIS: There's no
conceivable way I would believe

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.920
it, because first of all,
she was getting ready to go

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.840
to California for three months.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.120

away from me as you could get,

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.550
from Cocoa Beach to California.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.740
And she was really
excited about going.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:07.125
What reason would she
have for running away?

00:14:07.125 --> 00:14:10.070

Tammy saw something.

Tammy saw something
that she shouldn't have.

she was very frightened of.

Sometimes I feel if I had
asked her, rather than told her

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.544
that it was in her imagination,
maybe she would still be here.

could a 17-year-old girl

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:42.810
have seen that would cause
her to fear for her life?

During her breakdown
on the set of Scarface,

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:47.970
Tammy Lynn had mentioned
money laundering.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.730

at the US Customs Service,

cases in Florida

00:14:52.845 --> 00:14:56.280
were under federal
investigation at that time.

Tammy's mother believes it
is no coincidence at all.

00:15:04.896 --> 00:15:09.340
LINDA CURTIS: I think Tammy is
either a victim of foul play,

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:13.310
or she doesn't know who she is.

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:16.900
I, as a mother, wanted to
believe everything she told me,

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.080
and I wanted to help her.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.680
If I had it all to do over
again, I would go back

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:26.380
and I would believe every
single word she told me,

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.570
and I would just hide
her someplace until we

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.790

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.310

seem so good are the best.

Ultimately the entire

At that time, the girls
became very frightened

We followed the object
around to the back yard,

and at that point, a feeling
of fright came upon me.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.430

were overwhelming.

From beginning to end,
the 19 or 20 minutes

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:41.990

also a time of self-examination

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.630
and assigned to
set up some radar

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:44.980
to look for speeding cars.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.080
[RADIO CHATTER]

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.970
ANDI SADOFF: I had
the radar set up,

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:53.500
and I looked up into the sky and
saw, coming from east to west,

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.594
there was a series of lights.

00:20:55.594 --> 00:20:56.860
And at first I thought
it was a plane.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.070
It was quite a distance,
quite far away,

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:00.475
but it was really quite large.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.910
As I recall, there were
mostly white lights,

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:08.240
but there were
green lights also.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.880
It was alternating
green and white lights.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.500
It approached my vehicle, and
as it approached the vehicle,

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.420
it stopped, and it
seemed to hover.

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:21.880
There was no sound, and
I'm looking at this thing,

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.820
thinking, what is it?

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.470
When I put my head
out the window,

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:33.160
and I'm looking up
at it, it was huge.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.150
The thing that I recall
the most is, I was

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:36.740
amazed that there was no noise.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:41.720
There was no humming, there was
no engine, no low sound to it.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.090
It was absolutely silent.

00:21:48.158 --> 00:21:49.960
ROBERT STACK: Just
seconds later,

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.240
the eerie silence was broken.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.820
Another eyewitness report.

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.205
MAN (ON RADIO): Could you
please send somebody else?

00:21:56.205 --> 00:22:00.730
I'm observing
something incredible.

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.730
 Unit five to base,
I'm seeing it too.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:05.590
It's hovering above my car.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:10.290
It's heading towards
town, I'm following it.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:12.200
ANDI SADOFF: At the
time that we started

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.900
to transmit over the air,
that was about the time

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:15.890
that it started to move.

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:18.410
And it move very slowly.

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:20.240
Almost floated.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.200
And we followed it.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.820
We followed it until it
disappeared off into the hills.

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:28.725
I guess I was mostly curious
as to what it could be.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.470
Excited to try and figure out.

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:38.150
Well maybe it's this, or maybe
it's a government thing, or--

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:39.900
but I wasn't
frightened of it, no.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.700
There really wasn't time
to be frightened of it.

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.770
I was spending most
of my time trying

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:46.540
to figure out why there was no
noise coming out of this thing.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:47.566
So.

00:22:47.566 --> 00:22:50.720
ED BURNS: It was truly
a flying city, if that's

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.030
the way you want to call it.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.440
I mean, it was huge.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.780
ROBERT STACK: Computer
engineer Ed Burns is a retired

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.180
senior manager for IBM.

00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.970
At the time of the
sightings, Burns

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.640
handled the company's contracts
in Japan and South America.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.170
On the night of March 24th,
and virtually the same time

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:14.530
Officer Sadoff was pursuing
the mysterious object,

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:18.730
Ed Burns was driving home on the
Taconic Parkway, 10 miles north

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:19.630
of Sadoff's location.

00:23:22.492 --> 00:23:28.141
ED BURNS: Out of nowhere, I got
a lot of static on the radio.

00:23:28.141 --> 00:23:29.540
I thought maybe I was
in the wrong number,

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.670
and then I look over
to turn the dial again,

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:34.920
and that's when I looked
up and saw this craft.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.700
It was a triangular
chevron ship,

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:49.750
and the back of that chevron
had to be as large as a football

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:52.090
field at least.

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:56.580
It was one solid piece
of a chevron shape,

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.910
and there was no noise.

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:05.400
Seemed so close to the ground.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:09.990
It seemed like I could have
thrown a rock at it, maybe.

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:12.540
ROBERT STACK: Ed Burns
pulled off the highway

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:15.660
and joined a group of motorists
by the side of the road.

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:19.297
All were gazing skyward,
seemingly dumbstruck.

00:24:19.297 --> 00:24:22.790
[TIRES SCREECHING]
ED BURNS: It was so shocking.

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:25.450
This one fellow that was talking
to, never did answer me a bit.

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:28.980
 Isn't that incredible?

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:32.375
Have you ever seen
anything so huge?

00:24:32.375 --> 00:24:34.210
ED BURNS: He was just
staring at this thing,

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:37.340
and I remember his size
of his eyes were so huge.

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:38.740
And he never did
answer me at all.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.410
It It seemed like I
talked for an hour,

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:42.640
was probably only a minute,
but I was so excited about it.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:48.060
I wanted to share whatever
I was feeling at the time.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.600
Where was it from?

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.490
I'm not into astronomy.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.410
Mars, I mean, I don't
know the solar systems.

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:58.390
But what I had witnessed that
night was not from this planet.

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:06.070
ROBERT STACK: The
eyewitness reports

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.590
indicated the object
was slowly moving north

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:10.150
over the Hudson River Valley.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:19.230
Officers Sadoff, and at least
12 others saw it in Newcastle.

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:22.400
10 minutes later, Ed Burns,
and at least 20 motorists

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.260
saw it near Millwood.

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.330
10 minutes after
that, the phones

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:32.850
began ringing off the hook in
the police station at Yorktown.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:35.250
 Yorktown PD, Officer Wolf.

No, Ma'am, everything is fine.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:37.787
No, we've had several reports.

00:25:37.787 --> 00:25:38.720
Everything is under control.

Every single line, constantly.

Answer the phone, another
line would light up.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.000

another line would light up.

 There's really nothing to
worry-- please hold, Sir.

WILLIAM WOLF, JR.
Got to the point,

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:53.070
I got a call of Taconic
Parkway being stopped,

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:56.160
that people were
all out in the cars.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.600
It was starting to
get really crazy.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.016
 Go ahead, Soravilla.

00:25:59.016 --> 00:26:00.432
MAN (ON RADIO): I'll be 1017.

00:26:00.432 --> 00:26:02.490
WILLIAM WOLF JR.: I tried
calling the cars to find

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:04.140
out if they saw anything.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:08.610
And the only one that call
with the cars was Kevin,

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:10.305
said that he would stop in.

00:26:10.305 --> 00:26:12.900
ROBERT STACK: Officer
Kevin Soravilla had also

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.570
seen the dazzling lights
reported by dozens

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:16.890
of Yorktown residents.

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:18.090
 This town's going nuts.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:19.920
KEVIN SORAVILLA: The
object was extremely large

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:23.010
and estimated to be close
to 300 to 400 yards wide.

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.735
We stood out in front
facing to the north,

00:26:25.735 --> 00:26:28.170
in approximately about
five minutes, we did--

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:31.046
the object began to peer
from the northern horizon.

00:26:31.046 --> 00:26:32.950
 Look at that thing, man.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:36.282
 Unbelievable.

00:26:36.282 --> 00:26:39.700
ROBERT STACK: Officers Wolf and
Soravilla were standing side

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:43.210
by side under the same
sky, yet their accounts

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:45.662
are entirely contradictory.

00:26:45.662 --> 00:26:47.430
 It's gotta be a group
of planes or something.

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:48.329
 I don't think so.

00:26:48.329 --> 00:26:49.650
 Yeah, I think I
see a wing in there.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:50.890
 I don't think so.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:52.340
They don't look like planes.

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.930
ROBERT STACK: Officers Soravilla
is convinced that what he saw

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:59.512
was one large object with
a number of small lights.

00:26:59.512 --> 00:27:01.960
KEVIN SORAVILLA: I would
say approximate 16, 18,

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.260
lights running in a
v-formation, approximately

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.750
200 to 400 yards wide.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:09.710
I was staring in
between the lights

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:12.460
to see any type of a
solid structure, where

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.530
he may have basically
been staring

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:16.320
at the lights at themselves.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.410
WILLIAM WOLF JR.: They
looked like airplanes to me.

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:20.210
I say, "You know, I
live near an airport.

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:23.150
So I see these
airplanes every day."

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:25.750
So as they were coming
over, he says, "Well, you

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:26.950
can't hear anything."

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:27.850
I said, "Listen."

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:30.680
But that when we
started hearing a drone.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.900
It wasn't one big solid unit.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:36.200
But if you looked at it for
like a couple of minutes or even

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.270
a fraction as it
was coming over,

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:42.800
I could see where some people
would have gotten upset.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.060
ROBERT STACK: Suddenly the
Hudson Valley sightings

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.600
had taken a dramatic turn.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.000
It appeared that the
UFOs were a hoax,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.040
nothing more than small aircraft
flying in precise patterns.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.760
But this earthly explanation
was lost in an avalanche

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.890
of additional sightings,
which continued

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:00.570
unabated month after month.

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:07.460
In addition, many claim
the circular formation,

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:10.975
photographed as it swept
over the area, is also a UFO.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:17.180
However, other eyewitnesses
counter that the unusual lights

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:20.600
they had seen were nothing more
than small airplanes flying

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.250
in web shaped formations.

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:25.180
ANTHONY CAPALDI: There's
anywhere from upwards

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:30.650
of 7 to 10 aircraft that
do fly around in formation,

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:33.750
and this is visible
from our tower.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:36.570
Anthony Capaldi has been
an air traffic controller

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:38.760
for just under 10 years.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:42.210
In the summer of 1983,
he made an observation

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:46.046
that seemed to settle the UFO
controversy once and for all.

00:28:46.046 --> 00:28:46.945
[CHATTER]

00:28:46.945 --> 00:28:48.690
ANTHONY CAPALDI:
The first time I

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:54.201
observed the formation flying,
it looked a little peculiar.

00:28:54.201 --> 00:28:56.884
 What's that over Stormville?

00:28:56.884 --> 00:29:00.320
ANTHONY CAPALDI: And from our
vantage point in the tower,

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.330
they just appeared
to be just one

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:05.870
big light because there they
are flying in tight formation.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:15.786
To estimate the size, maybe
two football fields wide.

00:29:15.786 --> 00:29:17.600
 Appears to be six aircraft
flying in formation.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.500
I

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.740
ANTHONY CAPALDI: I imagine it's
possible, at first glimpse,

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:25.310
that an observer may not
be fully aware of what

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:27.290
this formation is.

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:31.250
But I don't think, if
this formation flew

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:34.040
over an individual's
head at 1,000 feet,

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.400
that there's any way you can
misdiagnose it for anything

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:41.750
but the formation flying, due to
the sound the aircraft engines.

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:45.080
And I imagine at 1,000
feet, you could really

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.220
determine that it's aircraft.

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:48.710
PHILLIP IMBROGNO:
The UFO was surely

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:52.670
seen before these hoaxer pilots
began their night flights.

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:57.230
And after these hoaxers
began their night flights,

00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:00.260
people would call me up who had
seen the UFO in previous dates

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.300
and said, well, I saw
something strange in the sky,

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.660
but it wasn't the same thing
that I saw a week before.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.310
It definitely was planes.

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:09.350
So you had people
who saw the UFO,

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:11.660
and then you had people
who saw the planes,

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:15.260
and were able to identify each
as being something strange

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:18.188
and something
totally explainable.

00:30:18.188 --> 00:30:20.092
 Holy good god.

00:30:20.092 --> 00:30:21.044
 What do you think?

00:30:21.044 --> 00:30:22.540
 I don't know.

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.570
 Not planes.

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:26.732
 I'm going to Tell
you something, Honey, I

00:30:26.732 --> 00:30:27.765
don't know what the hell it is.

00:30:27.765 --> 00:30:29.530
ROBERT STACK: This
home videotape

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:32.230
showing a light formation
above Brewster New York,

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:37.510
was taken July 24th, 1984, by
local resident Bob Pozzuoli.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:41.580
Phillip Imbrogno is
convinced it shows a UFO.

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.330
PHILLIP IMBROGNO: Being
a scientist myself,

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:47.590
I'm still waiting for it to be
proved 100%, although it has

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:50.650
been looked at by a number
of photographic experts

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:53.440
who indicate that the movement
of the object on the video

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:58.840
seems to be one rigid object,
and not individual objects.

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.700
Plus there were
hundreds and hundreds

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:04.810
of witnesses who saw the UFO and
said it was something strange.

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:07.930
But the night that the airplanes
were seen, there were also

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:11.620
dozens of witnesses who
said, in fact, that they did

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.700
see airplanes.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:18.400
ROBERT STACK: This image was
videotaped in June of 1984,

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.710
also by Bob Pozzuoli.

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:23.140
Skeptics and believers
all agree that it

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.960
shows a squadron of small
planes that some say

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.738
are military aircraft.

00:31:28.738 --> 00:31:30.106
 Did you hear the engines?

00:31:30.106 --> 00:31:31.474
 Mm-hm.

00:31:31.474 --> 00:31:34.510
PHILLIP IMBROGNO: If
you look at that video,

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:37.720
you can see that the lights are
shifting position in relation

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.920
to each other.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.320
The fellow who videotaped
it is talking about,

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.800
he can hear the engines, he
can see the stars as the object

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.320
is passing over him.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.040
A matter of fact,
when a videotape

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.560
was made of the airplanes,
no one came forward

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.150
to say they had seen a UFO.

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:53.800
People called me and
said they had seen

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.720
airplanes flying in formation.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.430
But the night of
the UFO sighting,

00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:01.210
when the videotape was made,
I had hundreds of phone calls

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:03.460
to different telephone
lines of people

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:05.610
who had, in fact, seen a UFO.

00:32:09.225 --> 00:32:10.810
ROBERT STACK: What
is the truth about

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:12.700
the spectacular
light formations that

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.040
cruise the Hudson River Valley?

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.910
Were the aerial stunts performed
by sophisticated pranksters,

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:22.060
or UFOs of unknown origin?

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.010
Even those who saw
the same object

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:26.810
at the same time cannot agree.

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:30.060
WILLIAM WOLF JR.: I personally
think that it was an airplane,

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:33.980
or people who were playing
games, trying to take--

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:39.270
get a rush and excitement out
of making people feel, "Hey,

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:41.710
there's somebody from
another world here,"

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:47.765
where in fact, they were
just fooling people's mind.

00:32:47.765 --> 00:32:49.280
KEVIN SORAVILLA: If
it was ultra lights,

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.820
I'm a little amazed by
the precision flying.

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:54.920
I have to see it
again to believe it.

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.510
I'm not too sure.

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:57.760
I'm not too sure about it.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.370
DENNIS SANT: In a man's
life, particular things

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:07.180
unfold that make an impression
for the rest of their life.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:10.480
This was one of those
moments in my time

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:14.230
that made a very dramatic
impression upon me.

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:17.031
What I saw was not
planes in formation.

00:33:20.258 --> 00:33:22.580
ANDI SADOFF: There
was no shaking

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:27.030
or movement or rocking back
and forth of any of the lights.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:29.000
It was perfectly still.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.860
You know, I'm not trying
to say what it was.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.440
I don't know what it was.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.860
I know it wasn't an airplane.

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.600
ED BURNS: I tell the story
a lot to certain friends

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.480
that I can trust
that will believe me.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.130
I mean, my wife I
think believes me,

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:45.890
because she loves
me and respects me.

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:49.460
I don't know if my children do,
but they love and respect me.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:53.110
But they also read the papers,
I guess about those five

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:54.440
other airplanes.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.820
Maybe they equate it to that.

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.130
But boy I'll tell
you, I'll never

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:04.510
forget that as long as I live,
and five airplanes, it was not.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:06.780
ROBERT STACK: In preparing
to film this story,

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.909
Unsolved Mysteries asked
the alleged hoaxers

00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:12.570
to recreate one of their
flights during daylight hours.

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:15.810
No one was willing to
be publicly identified.

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:18.870
This may be because when flown
at night, some of the maneuvers

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:21.840
violate FAA regulations.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:24.870
According to Tony Capaldi,
most of the formation flights

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:27.330
took place on Thursday nights.

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:29.550
It is interesting to note
that less than one third

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:32.690
of the UFO sightings
occurred on Thursday nights.

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:39.486
In a moment, a young man dies
under tragic circumstances.

00:34:39.486 --> 00:34:51.429
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:54.954
September 30th, 1991,
Paducah, Kentucky.

00:34:54.954 --> 00:34:55.929
 Are you a pilot?

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:57.120
 Um,no, I'm sure not.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.660
 Do you know a
pilot I can talk to?

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.201
 No, I sure don't.

00:35:00.201 --> 00:35:02.380
ROBERT STACK: Just
after 6:00 PM,

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:05.200
a young man approached
airport worker Wes Weaver

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.580
at Paducah's small airfield.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.590
 Listen, I'm really in a bind.

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.140
I really need to get out west.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:13.820
You've got to know somebody
here that can help me out?

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.490
WES WEAVER: I kind of
thought that maybe he

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:17.830
was into something he
wasn't supposed to into,

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:20.200
running from something.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.604
Because he honestly--
he didn't act drugged up

00:35:22.604 --> 00:35:23.770
and he didn't act
like he was drunk

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:25.380
and he really didn't act crazy.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:27.150
He was kind of desperate.

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:28.900
 Come on, man.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.270
Look, I've got this jacket,
isn't there's some way I can

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:32.920
trade this jacket for a lift?

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.615
You know, one of the
pilots around here?

00:35:34.615 --> 00:35:37.120
ROBERT STACK: What began
as an odd encounter

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:40.920
soon evolved into a tragic
and perplexing mystery.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.084
 Really, I don't think I can--

00:35:42.084 --> 00:35:43.650
WES WEAVER: I finally
just kind of told him no,

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:46.850
and made it to the point
where he should leave.

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:48.760
And he stood around
for a little while,

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:52.770
and finally he went
back through the hangar.

00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:55.490
ROBERT STACK: 30 minutes
later, Wes Weaver

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:58.520
saw the stranger again.

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.530
WES WEAVER: And he
had the jacket on

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:02.420
and I thought it
was kind of strange,

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:03.920
so I kind of slowed
down and watched,

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:07.640
and I saw him run across the
ditch and jump up on the fence

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.590
and jump over and run
towards the plane,

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:11.880
and that's when I radioed
for someone to call security.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.180
 You better call security,
we got a guy jumping

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.682
over the fence at two two.

00:36:16.682 --> 00:36:19.430
ROBERT STACK: Two other
witnesses saw the young man

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:20.780
run across the airstrip.

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.570
LINDA LEAB: Me and my
husband was out in the yard,

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:28.480
and this plane pulled up,
and we saw this guy run it

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:34.120
in the field, and he run over to
on the other side of the plane.

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:36.170
Well, we never did
see him no more.

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:40.330
JERRY LEAB: The way he
was running to it so fast,

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:42.655
he was up to something.

00:36:42.655 --> 00:36:44.800
ROBERT STACK: The only
aircraft on the runway

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.980
was commuter flight
2940, destination,

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.990
Memphis, Tennessee.

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:53.410
Just before sunset
at exactly 6:49,

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:55.480
the plane was
cleared for takeoff.

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.670
Everything seemed normal.

00:37:01.125 --> 00:37:03.685
LINDA LEAB: The plane
got way up in the air,

00:37:03.685 --> 00:37:06.750
and I stood there, you know,
was watching, in a few minutes I

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:11.390
seen something fall,
and I told my husband,

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:16.125
I said, there's something
fell out of that plane.

00:37:16.125 --> 00:37:19.570
ROBERT STACK: As darkness fell,
airport authorities mobilized

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:23.110
an extensive search, looking for
any sign of the man witnesses

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:24.010
had seen.

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:28.980
At the northern end
of the airfield,

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.500
director of airfield
services, Ron Jones,

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.620
noticed a section of fence
which had been damaged.

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:38.955
Lying at the base was the
body of the young stranger.

00:37:38.955 --> 00:37:43.830
RON JONES: It really hit me then
that this actually happened,

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:48.840
that someone actually got onto
an aircraft some kind of way,

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:51.971
and that someone had
fallen to their death.

00:37:51.971 --> 00:37:54.150
ROBERT STACK: No
identification of any kind

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:56.740
was found on or near the body.

00:37:59.012 --> 00:38:01.210
 As we examine
the hand, we note

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:05.500
that the nails appear to be
manicured and well-groomed.

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.090
ROBERT STACK: Blood
tests revealed

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:11.460
no traces of drugs or alcohol
in the victim's system.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:14.620
JERRY BEYER: We noticed that
his body was well-tanned,

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.170
and that there were
not any tan lines.

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:21.800
The pubic hair was shaved and
in a swimmer's type style,

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:25.730
or of someone who may
have been wearing tights.

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:30.370
We searched out leads with
a male dancer troop that

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:32.110
was here, the
Chippendale type dancers,

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:33.640
who were here the week prior.

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:37.630
And we base that on to his
well-developed physical

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:40.930
appearance, his tanned
body, the shaved pubic area,

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:42.640
and all of those
leads were negative

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.865
when they were researched.

00:38:44.865 --> 00:38:48.110
ROBERT STACK: This is the
jacket worn by the young man.

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:50.230
In one of the pockets,
investigators found

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:52.180
a pair of swimming goggles.

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:54.400
Sewn into the collar
was an ID tag,

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.540
inscribed Lieutenant
L.F. Price, USAF.

00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:04.282
A check of military records
could find no such person.

00:39:04.282 --> 00:39:06.610
RICHARD ROOF: When
we go back and look

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:12.006
at the series of events that
led up to this incident,

00:39:12.006 --> 00:39:15.740
the individual had approximately
90 seconds to two minutes

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:18.740
to climb over a 7 and
1/2 foot high fence,

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:22.330
traverse approximately 800 foot
of terrain, including one ditch

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:25.760
system, run around the
aircraft's tail section,

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.800
and then climb on the
aircraft, although we

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:33.680
have no actual eyewitnesses to
his climbing on the aircraft.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.630
And again the time
interval was between 90

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:37.430
seconds and 120 seconds.

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:38.980
It's quite an accomplishment.

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.540
ROBERT STACK: Within
seconds, flight 2940

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:49.730
was barreling down the
runway at 125 miles an hour.

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:51.730
Once air born, the
speed increased

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:55.444
to more than 190 miles an hour.

00:39:55.444 --> 00:39:59.440
RICHARD ROOF: And that obviously
is a substantial wind force

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:04.050
upon anyone trying to stay
on the wing of an aircraft

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:07.240
with really no handholds.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.920
We judge at this point
that he managed to stay on

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:14.210
for approximately
3,000 to 3,500 feet

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:16.386
after the aircraft
departed the ground.

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:26.490
RON JONES: I wonder what was
so important to make him take

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:29.700
a chance on trying
to catch a ride

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:32.340
on the outside of an aircraft.

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:36.170
JIM GREIF: I think that there's
an answer with his family.

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:40.650
His family may not even know
that he was coming home.

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:43.320
And I think that that's
probably-- if we could just

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:44.520
get over that hurdle there--

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:46.684
I think we could find out why.

00:40:46.684 --> 00:41:09.049

time for another edition

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:13.590
of Unsolved Mysteries.
