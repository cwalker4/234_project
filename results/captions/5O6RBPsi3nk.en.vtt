00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.670
- Everybody, we're back with Walter Carr,

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.933
a really inspiring young man

00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:07.600
who walked 20 miles to make
it to his first day of work.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.520
What motivated you to walk

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.570
instead of callin' off your first day?

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.520
- I had just got laid off my job for UPS.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.870
So I put in job applications,

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.910
and nobody would give me a call back.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.970
And I was just like, if somebody
just give me that chance,

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.380
I can show 'em who I am.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.387
And the mover company called me and said,

00:00:23.387 --> 00:00:24.720
"Hey, you're hired."

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.020
And I was so grateful for that.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.900
My car broke down.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.528
My ride bailed on me, and I was like.

00:00:29.528 --> 00:00:30.397
I was thinkin', "I can get there.

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:32.077
"I got two legs and two feet.

00:00:32.077 --> 00:00:33.330
"I have a way to get there."

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.047
So I was supposed to be
there at 7:45 in the morning.

00:00:36.047 --> 00:00:38.736
I left at 11:40 p.m. that night.

00:00:38.736 --> 00:00:41.220
At 4:00 in the morning, right
before you get on the highway,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.500
I decided to take a two-minute rest.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.340
And at that time, a
Pelham police officer came

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.287
to the side and said, "How are you?

00:00:46.287 --> 00:00:47.120
"Are you okay?"

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.527
I said, "It gonna sound real crazy,

00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:49.487
"but I'm actually headin' to work

00:00:49.487 --> 00:00:51.210
"on my first day of the job."

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.780
- So what happened next?

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.410
- His friend that knew of me, in the area,

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.110
came picked me up and drove
me the rest of the few miles.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.340
And at 6:30 in the morning,
we arrived at the home,

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.777
house, and he went ahead and checked.

00:01:02.777 --> 00:01:06.010
And it was okay for me to
come in and be this early.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.821
- So the homeowner, Jenny, is here.

00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:12.821
(audience applauds)

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.840
Okay, so you're the homeowner.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.660
What'd you think when you opened the door,

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.710
and you found out what
had happened to Walter?

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.130
- To be honest, my eyes
just filled with tears.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.730
At 6:30 in the morning, to hear

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.980
that story, you just
loved him, right away.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.220
I mean, he just, just a fine
young man, you can tell.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.410
And, you know, being a
mom, I knew he was tired.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.977
I said, "Hey, why don't you go on upstairs

00:01:34.977 --> 00:01:37.167
"and just take a little rest
before we start the move?

00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:38.477
"And that way, you can, you know,

00:01:38.477 --> 00:01:39.631
"rest before your team comes."

00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:40.464
- Wait a minute; hold it.

00:01:40.464 --> 00:01:44.150
You tell this kid to go
upstairs in your house,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.110
in a bedroom, and rest.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.940
- I did because I knew he had to be tired.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.997
And he said, "No ma'am,
I wanna get started

00:01:48.997 --> 00:01:50.759
"and help you guys move."

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.880
(audience applauds)
So, yeah.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.870
- All right, so let's
get to this part, folks.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.330
Luke Marklin, who happens to be the CEO

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.420
of Bellhop Movers, was so impressed

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.160
by Walter's determination

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.150
that he wanted to personally thank him.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.920
Check it out.
(upbeat band music)

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.610
- Got everything he needs to be a Bellhop.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.800
The one piece he's missing is like,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.500
a way to get there.
- It is.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.380
- So this is my car.
(distant traffic)

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.570
I'd like it to be your car.
- Seriously?

00:02:22.414 --> 00:02:25.414
(audience applauds)

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.460
- This whole story is so good.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.280
It's so good on so many levels.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.470
You know, first of all, young people.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.320
To find that type of grit and hustle

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.750
in a young person, today.
(audience applauds)

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.583
Today.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.530
Jenny was so inspired to help Walter out

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.110
that she set up a GoFundMe for him.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.680
The goal was to reach $2,000.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.106
It ended up collecting more than $90,000.

00:03:01.106 --> 00:03:03.840
(audience exclaims and applauds)

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.090
Walter, what'd you do?

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.520
- I gave $25,000 to Birmingham
Education Foundation

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.890
that I was in in high school.
(audience applauds)

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.660
Their organization gets
high school students

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.130
ready to go into college
life and get ready for--

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.800
- So you knew about this organization.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.040
- Yes, I was in it in high school.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.873
- Oh, you were in it.

00:03:21.873 --> 00:03:25.029
- Yes, so they made me
to be what I am, today.

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:25.862
(audience applauds)
- Really?

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.410
You know him?
- Yes, I know him.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.000
- Mr. Carpenter, what would
you like to tell Walter?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.670
- Well, Walter, you've inspired me.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.520
You've inspired thousands of
people, all over the world.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.750
And with your permission,
we wanna use the donation

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.274
that you gave us to start
the Walter Carr Award.

00:03:48.274 --> 00:03:51.274
(audience applauds)

00:03:52.594 --> 00:03:55.010
- I mean, for him to do that in your name.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.430
For this woman to open up her home.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.900
For this guy to give you a car.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.530
It's still a lotta good
people in this country, man.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.889
It's still a lotta good people who care.

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:07.593
(audience applauds)
It just is, man.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.863
It just really does take a village.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.613
You're 20.
- Yeah.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.210
- You ain't see this comin'.

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:17.043
- No sir, I didn't.

00:04:17.043 --> 00:04:18.090
And you my biggest idol.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.962
I always idolized you, like my whole life.

00:04:20.962 --> 00:04:21.890
(audience applauds)
Every show,

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.480
everything you do, I've
always been there, to watch.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.006
- Hey man, don't do this to me, today.

00:04:27.006 --> 00:04:31.089
(audience chuckles and applauds)

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.950
- It's an honor to be here.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.330
It's an honor to be here,
to see my biggest idol

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.477
and be right here with you.

00:04:41.477 --> 00:04:43.600
It's a blessin' to me.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.080
I thank God for it.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.513
I really do.
(audience applauds)

00:04:51.223 --> 00:04:53.090
(pats armrest)
See, you know man,

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.730
what's crazy about this is,

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.160
if you're a spiritual person,
you ain't missin' this.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.780
You just gotta see how
it all come together.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.690
You have no idea who God made you to be.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.310
But you gotta hang in there to find out.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.750
You can't give up.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.370
It's at your darkest moments, He show up.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.920
He show up; He be shinin', man.

00:05:14.774 --> 00:05:17.150
(audience applauds)
God show up.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.537
See, the color is all out of this story.

00:05:20.537 --> 00:05:22.893
This ain't a story about color.

00:05:23.814 --> 00:05:25.677
(audience exclaims and applauds)

00:05:25.677 --> 00:05:29.500
This is really; this is really the truth

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.870
about who we are and
who we supposed to be.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.347
It ain't 'posed to be, "No, oh God,

00:05:33.347 --> 00:05:34.977
"he can't come stay in my house.

00:05:34.977 --> 00:05:36.557
"Who that little black man at the house?

00:05:36.557 --> 00:05:37.570
"Call the police."

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.210
The police, we keep hearin' about

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.800
how they don't pick us up.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.670
They do pick you up.
(audience applauds)

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.483
The police will go get
you somethin' to eat.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.303
Every police ain't shootin' us.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.210
We gotta start; we gotta start
tellin' these stories, man,

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.810
because these are stories
that's gotta get out.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.920
Because it inspires other people.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.290
This is so crazy, the way this happenin'.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.280
Who lets somebody they don't know

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.740
come in their house and
go upstairs and lay down?

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.300
Who gives away a car?

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.660
Who puts a scholarship?

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.170
You got a scholarship in
your name, doll. (chuckles)

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.223
That's crazy.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.930

(audience applauds)

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.990

That's not the only surprise we got.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.150
Your dedication and determination

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.190

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.380
it just inspires all of us to be better.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.350
You have no idea the path you're set on.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.403
You don't know, man.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.350
You can actually be

00:06:40.348 --> 00:06:44.130
a poor kid from nothin'.
- Yeah.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.100
- And because of God's Grace and Mercy,

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.436
He can put you in places
(audience applauds)

00:06:50.436 --> 00:06:52.293
you never, ever thought you'd be.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.800
See, I'm sittin' here.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.473
I'm trippin' 'cause I'm a you.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:06.453
I was a kid out of the dirt.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.800
And where I am today,

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.373
is because of that Grace and Mercy.

00:07:12.373 --> 00:07:13.920
(audience exclaims)

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.113
It's sorta crazy, man.

00:07:16.098 --> 00:07:18.830
I hope you see what's happenin'

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.060
and get on this path and stay there

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.740
'cause you didn't sent in
this direction for no reason.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.750
You ain't got a scholarship
in your name for no reason.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.070
These people didn't give
you this car for no reason.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.650
This woman didn't open up
her house for no reason.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.620
The police didn't pick you up

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.870
and didn't do you like you read about.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.100
They helped you; they fed you.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.100
All of this happened
(claps hands)

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.700
for a reason.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.060
You got to stay on that path, man.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.305
- Yes, sir.

00:07:48.305 --> 00:07:49.700
- 'Cause of that, we gonna send you

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.650
on a five-night getaway

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.118
to the True Bay Boutique
Resort in Grenada.

00:07:55.118 --> 00:07:58.365
(audience applauds)

00:07:58.365 --> 00:08:01.850
Yeah, now, you probably
don't know where that is

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.280
'cause I didn't know where
Grenada was 'til I was 44.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.507
So you gonna need a passport.

00:08:06.507 --> 00:08:08.450
You gotta a passport?
- No, I--

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:09.450
- You gotta get busy, doll.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:10.870
See, I know all this.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.610
At 20, I didn't have nothin'.
