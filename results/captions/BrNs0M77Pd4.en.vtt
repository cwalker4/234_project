00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.790
The subject of my talk tonight

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.851
is about something
that is smarter than you are:

00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:14.421
artificial intelligence.

00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:18.621
In fact, a lot of people who work
in artificial intelligence believe

00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:22.421
that artificial intelligence is
a thousand times smarter than we are.

00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:24.451
It will be moving at speeds

00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:27.051
that are a hundred thousand times
as fast as we think,

00:00:27.051 --> 00:00:30.101
and it will be digesting
information and data

00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:33.091
a million times more than we can.

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:35.351
What is artificial intelligence?

00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:39.341
There're a lot of confused ideas
about this outside in the world,

00:00:39.951 --> 00:00:42.981
but the answer is very simple;
it's one sentence:

00:00:43.391 --> 00:00:47.641
artificial intelligence
is software that writes itself.

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:52.341
It writes its own updates.
It renews itself.

00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:54.962
We normally tend to think of software

00:00:54.962 --> 00:00:57.352
as stuff that we created
and that we wrote,

00:00:57.352 --> 00:01:01.019
and the machines do what we tell
them to do, and we own it.

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.799
This is not any longer true.

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.609
It writes itself at speeds
that we can hardly comprehend,

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:09.269
and people who write it know

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:13.329
that you can't take it apart again
and figure out what it has done.

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.289
It writes independently, autonomously;

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:18.729
it develops its own way of thinking,

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.229
and there are dangers
associated with that.

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:24.879
A lot of people ask,
"When is it going to happen?

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:29.249
When is artificial intelligence
going to be smarter than us people?"

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:31.789
Some people say 50 years.

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.759
Some say 30 years.

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:35.949
Some say five years.

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:40.411
I say it already has surpassed us

00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:44.241
in many areas of our society.

00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:50.340
Let's take some examples
from right here and now.

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:55.411
The examples
that we're going to talk about

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.676
are not science fiction;

00:01:57.676 --> 00:02:00.976
they're not visions or things
that are going to happen at some point.

00:02:00.976 --> 00:02:04.253
They're things that exist today,
for example in the stock markets,

00:02:04.253 --> 00:02:07.693
whether Frankfurt or Tokyo
or New York or London.

00:02:08.123 --> 00:02:12.190
The people you see down there working,
on your TV show when you're watching,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.650
they're more or less extras in a movie.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.080
They aren't doing the big moving.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.150
The big moving is being done
by high-frequency computers.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.318
They move so fast, they make,
in milliseconds, billion-dollar business.

00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:30.051
Computers have far succeeded
what we can do.

00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:32.050
In fact, I did a film once
about a company

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.070
that moved five blocks closer
to the Frankfurt stock market

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.216
because at the speed
of light on glass cable,

00:02:40.216 --> 00:02:42.511
they saved so much time,

00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:47.402
getting closer to the computers
at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

00:02:47.682 --> 00:02:50.841
That will give you an idea
of how fast they think

00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:52.801
and how helpless we,
as human beings, are.

00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:55.341
You may remember the old pictures
of the stock brokers

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:58.831
with five telephones in each hand,
running back and forth, writing things,

00:02:58.831 --> 00:03:01.481
that was way before yesterday!

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:05.881
Computers have taken over this very,
very important part of our society,

00:03:05.881 --> 00:03:08.751
a heart of our financial community.

00:03:08.751 --> 00:03:12.051
And no one understands exactly
how these algorithms function.

00:03:12.051 --> 00:03:13.441
They used to understand them,

00:03:13.441 --> 00:03:16.771
but they've been improved
by artificial intelligence.

00:03:16.882 --> 00:03:18.942
I don't know how many people
flew in today,

00:03:18.942 --> 00:03:20.802
but if you were sitting in an airplane,

00:03:20.802 --> 00:03:24.692
you probably had 30 different tariffs
and prices in your cabin

00:03:24.692 --> 00:03:29.442
because the pricing is all done -
the same is true of hotels -

00:03:29.442 --> 00:03:31.950
by machines that are collecting
global information,

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.180
making decisions within split seconds

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.370
what the price of that airplane seat
or that hotel room is going to be.

00:03:38.663 --> 00:03:41.252
And where it's most critical of all -

00:03:42.093 --> 00:03:44.023
we're talking about life and death -

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:45.433
is in medicine.

00:03:45.583 --> 00:03:49.133
Computers are better
than we are, as human beings,

00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:51.213
in several areas already today.

00:03:51.213 --> 00:03:54.743
We're talking about here and now;
this is not science fiction.

00:03:54.743 --> 00:03:58.633
I'm speaking next week
at the Universitätsklinikum in Essen,

00:03:58.943 --> 00:04:00.802
and their radiologists,

00:04:00.808 --> 00:04:03.843
who are supposed to be
some of the best radiologists in Germany,

00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:08.654
they say that a computer
can recognize a tumor

00:04:08.654 --> 00:04:11.934
on an MRT or a CT,

00:04:11.934 --> 00:04:16.944
faster and better and more precisely
than a human being can.

00:04:17.896 --> 00:04:22.006
It's picture analysis,
and it's done very well by computers,

00:04:22.006 --> 00:04:25.436
especially in medicine
where it saves lives.

00:04:27.103 --> 00:04:30.823
Now, the robots are getting
better and better; they're looking cute.

00:04:30.823 --> 00:04:33.883
They have these big baby eyes,
a sweet way of looking at you.

00:04:33.883 --> 00:04:37.663
They can examine your facial
expression and adjust their's.

00:04:37.913 --> 00:04:41.995
But don't be fooled by robots
even when they get warm skin, perfume,

00:04:41.995 --> 00:04:45.705
and they start smelling like us
and getting really interesting.

00:04:45.705 --> 00:04:48.374
They are still machines.

00:04:48.374 --> 00:04:51.004
They have no warm blood in them.
There's no sex in them.

00:04:51.054 --> 00:04:52.754
They have no mortality.

00:04:52.824 --> 00:04:56.024
They're cold code lines,

00:04:57.031 --> 00:04:58.879
and they shouldn't be misunderstood.

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:01.638
Now, I want you to understand

00:05:01.638 --> 00:05:04.657
what the power
of artificial intelligence is,

00:05:04.657 --> 00:05:08.677
and I have two examples:
one is surveillance cameras.

00:05:08.677 --> 00:05:12.456
Everybody knows that we're being
watched by cameras everywhere,

00:05:12.456 --> 00:05:15.286
and most people think
surveillance is a camera there,

00:05:15.286 --> 00:05:17.391
and it's me down here,
and it's watching me:

00:05:17.391 --> 00:05:19.466
one person, one camera.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.610
Well, that's because we're stupid.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.900
That's the way we comprehend
the surveillance: one camera, one person.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.510
We can't comprehend it
when it goes beyond that -

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.430
(Ominous music)

00:05:36.049 --> 00:05:40.948
(Video) Narrator: This image was taken
17,500 feet above Quantico, Virginia,

00:05:40.948 --> 00:05:43.768
and covers 15 square miles.

00:05:44.238 --> 00:05:47.788
Yiannis Antoniades: This whole image
is at a very, very fine resolution.

00:05:47.788 --> 00:05:52.638
So if we wanted to know what's going on
in any spot along this image,

00:05:52.638 --> 00:05:55.308
let's say near this building
at this intersection,

00:05:55.308 --> 00:05:59.938
everything that is a moving object
is being automatically tracked.

00:05:59.938 --> 00:06:01.713
The color boxes represent

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.788
that the computer has recognized
the moving objects.

00:06:05.028 --> 00:06:07.538
You can see individuals
crossing the street.

00:06:07.608 --> 00:06:10.388
You can see individuals
walking in parking lots.

00:06:10.718 --> 00:06:12.777
There's actually enough resolution

00:06:12.777 --> 00:06:15.907
to be able to see the people
waving their arms

00:06:15.907 --> 00:06:18.527
or walking around
and what kind of clothes they wear.

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:23.389
Narrator: Unlike the predator camera
that limits field of view,

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:27.843
ARGUS-IS melts together videos
from each of its 368 chips

00:06:27.843 --> 00:06:32.073
to create a 1.8 billion
pixel video stream.

00:06:32.943 --> 00:06:38.177
This makes it possible to zoom in
and still see tremendous detail.

00:06:38.657 --> 00:06:43.901
Jay Tuck: And it produces
a million terabytes every day.

00:06:43.901 --> 00:06:45.256
That's a lot of data.

00:06:45.256 --> 00:06:46.774
I'm telling you this because -

00:06:46.777 --> 00:06:50.734
not that the sensors are modern
and not that the photography is modern -

00:06:50.734 --> 00:06:55.144
behind that is a brain,
or a cognitive intelligence,

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:01.350
and that brain is in a position
to analyze everybody down there.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.210
At the same time, in real time,
they see where everyone is going.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.052
We can understand that
when we reduce it to a single person,

00:07:09.052 --> 00:07:10.404
but we can't understand it

00:07:10.404 --> 00:07:15.110
when you're talking about
a hundred thousand people in a city,

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.240
plus the vehicles
which are all recognized.

00:07:18.841 --> 00:07:21.754
Due to such systems, they have
also redone facial recognition.

00:07:21.754 --> 00:07:25.500
You probably think facial
recognition is from the front,

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.880
but they've redone it
to do it from the top

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.600
because that's where the drones are.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.760
They look at your ears,
the way you walk, your head -

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.370
that's modern facial recognition.

00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:41.681
So, that's one idea: as a human being,
we think of one camera and one person.

00:07:43.197 --> 00:07:46.231
This is a little of their things:

00:07:46.231 --> 00:07:50.415
It's taking all the details,
all the musing after, and then record it,

00:07:50.418 --> 00:07:54.175
so they can tell where that person was
two weeks ago, two months ago,

00:07:54.175 --> 00:07:58.015
what stores he visited,
what his whole behavioral patterns are.

00:07:58.015 --> 00:08:01.859
That's all part of the analysis of Argus.

00:08:02.876 --> 00:08:07.916
These are called "tennis balls"
in military and intelligence circles.

00:08:08.268 --> 00:08:11.558
It's a new secretive sensoric thing.

00:08:11.558 --> 00:08:15.128
Cruise missile would fly
into a valley in Afghanistan -

00:08:15.128 --> 00:08:19.868
this is especially important because
the troops have left many of these areas -

00:08:19.868 --> 00:08:24.858
and would drop literally thousands
of these sensor packages or tennis balls -

00:08:24.858 --> 00:08:27.447
they're all packed in foam rubber.

00:08:28.034 --> 00:08:30.084
They record with cameras.

00:08:30.084 --> 00:08:32.034
They record with microphones.

00:08:32.034 --> 00:08:34.520
They record with seismic measurements.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.493
They record with Geiger counters.

00:08:36.493 --> 00:08:40.801
They record with chemical sensors,
they can look for chemical things.

00:08:40.801 --> 00:08:42.504
That's not the amazing part of it,

00:08:42.504 --> 00:08:45.918
and it's not the amazing part
that their signal goes to a transmitter

00:08:45.918 --> 00:08:47.310
and then up to the satellite:

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.930
old technology, nothing special.

00:08:50.287 --> 00:08:52.277
The special part of it is,

00:08:52.277 --> 00:08:56.857
behind that system,
there's a fusion software

00:08:56.857 --> 00:09:02.027
that can combine the audio and the visual
and the seismic and the chemical,

00:09:02.027 --> 00:09:05.177
all of these signals,
and make sense of them,

00:09:05.177 --> 00:09:09.087
and analyze on the ground
what kind of troop movements there are,

00:09:09.087 --> 00:09:12.097
the kinds of vehicles they're using,
what are they transporting,

00:09:12.097 --> 00:09:13.937
and if there's radioactivity in that.

00:09:13.937 --> 00:09:16.685
It takes all these different
pieces of information

00:09:16.685 --> 00:09:21.155
and turns it through fusion software
into an understandable picture

00:09:21.155 --> 00:09:25.805
which goes way beyond,
way beyond our vision.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.180
Artificial intelligence only works
if you have huge data masses.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.970
Artificial intelligence only works
if you have big data,

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.360
but big data only works

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.930
if you have artificial intelligence
to make sense of it

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.850
because human beings can
no longer sort and sift and order

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.150
the huge volumes of data
that we have collected.

00:09:48.635 --> 00:09:50.355
(Music)

00:09:50.941 --> 00:09:53.681
And thus it is not surprising

00:09:53.681 --> 00:09:57.571
that the company that has
the most information in the world -

00:09:57.571 --> 00:10:00.351
it's probably the most powerful
company in the world -

00:10:00.351 --> 00:10:01.891
Google,

00:10:01.891 --> 00:10:04.551
is very interested
in artificial intelligence

00:10:04.551 --> 00:10:07.771
and has been travelling
around the world as a shopping queen,

00:10:07.771 --> 00:10:10.621
buying all the companies
that are dealing with robotics -

00:10:10.621 --> 00:10:13.851
this is one of their robots called Atlas.

00:10:14.251 --> 00:10:16.360
They're buying
our artificial intelligence,

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.340
all the artificial intelligence companies
from around the world.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.910
Now, if you ask Google,

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.770
it's a peaceful robot, right?

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.163
He doesn't have a gun;
he doesn't throw atomic bombs.

00:10:29.163 --> 00:10:32.663
He just walks around and stands there.

00:10:32.663 --> 00:10:36.213
But you may have seen
the superimposes of DARPA -

00:10:36.213 --> 00:10:39.873
Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency.

00:10:39.873 --> 00:10:44.123
That is the research arm of the Pentagon.

00:10:44.625 --> 00:10:48.305
Then, you see the video
is made by Lockheed Martin,

00:10:48.305 --> 00:10:51.904
which is one of the most
powerful and influential

00:10:51.904 --> 00:10:56.174
and richest weapons
companies in the world.

00:10:56.334 --> 00:10:58.794
So why is the Pentagon
investing this money?

00:10:58.794 --> 00:11:03.754
Why has Lockheed Martin
taken over large aspects of the company?

00:11:04.391 --> 00:11:06.031
This guy is called "Big Dog."

00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:09.861
He also belongs to Google,
also DARPA financed.

00:11:09.861 --> 00:11:11.711
Peaceful dog, right?

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:15.520
Unless he gets caught on a maneuver
with the United States Marines,

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.720
as part of a military unit.

00:11:18.443 --> 00:11:21.073
So, these are not flower children.

00:11:21.343 --> 00:11:23.503
These are robots that have a function.

00:11:23.503 --> 00:11:25.953
And robots that have
a function and an intelligence,

00:11:25.953 --> 00:11:30.183
and perhaps an intelligence that goes
beyond us, are dangerous things.

00:11:30.344 --> 00:11:32.194
Now that's a Predator drone;

00:11:32.194 --> 00:11:35.704
this was taken at a secret United States
Air Force base in New Mexico.

00:11:36.445 --> 00:11:40.365
Predator drones, you've seen them, right?
On TV, in the newspapers ...

00:11:40.573 --> 00:11:44.530
They're old!
They're 20-years-old technology.

00:11:44.808 --> 00:11:48.104
It looks very scary
when the Spiegel and the ARD

00:11:48.104 --> 00:11:50.935
write about modern technology
and the guys with a joystick

00:11:50.935 --> 00:11:56.056
that are killing people and Taliban
in Afghanistan far away,

00:11:56.716 --> 00:12:00.196
but that's what a modern drone looks like.

00:12:00.336 --> 00:12:05.386
This is not a Predator; it's a Pegasus,
an X-47B owned by the Navy.

00:12:05.579 --> 00:12:09.164
It's a jet-powered machine
not like a propeller-driven Predator.

00:12:09.164 --> 00:12:12.574
It goes 2,000 miles into enemy territory.

00:12:12.574 --> 00:12:15.885
It carries 2,000 kilos
worth of explosives,

00:12:15.885 --> 00:12:17.854
and it's run by artificial intelligence.

00:12:17.871 --> 00:12:19.581
It starts alone,

00:12:19.581 --> 00:12:21.501
flies its mission alone,

00:12:21.501 --> 00:12:23.271
comes back alone,

00:12:23.271 --> 00:12:27.781
and here's the clue, it lands
all by itself on an aircraft carrier.

00:12:28.407 --> 00:12:30.515
Talk to any pilot you've ever met:

00:12:30.515 --> 00:12:33.555
what's the most difficult landing area
you can possibly imagine?

00:12:33.555 --> 00:12:37.735
They'd say it's an aircraft carrier -
short runway, thing's moving - very hard.

00:12:37.735 --> 00:12:42.915
This thinking drone can do it, 
but here are the two keys to Pegasus.

00:12:44.249 --> 00:12:46.629
Pegasus is invisible.

00:12:47.443 --> 00:12:50.363
I'm not talking about stealth
and being invisible to radar.

00:12:50.363 --> 00:12:53.468
I'm talking about invisible
to the human eye,

00:12:53.473 --> 00:12:56.343
and you won't find this
in any newspaper anywhere.

00:12:56.343 --> 00:13:02.743
It's invisible to the human eye
because the bottom has an LED layer on it,

00:13:02.743 --> 00:13:04.427
and the top has cameras,

00:13:04.434 --> 00:13:07.420
which have been removed
here in the picture,

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.810
which film the sky,
and they project on the bottom

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.550
a live picture of clouds
up above the aircraft,

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.470
and you can hardly see it.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.770
They're responsible for a lot
of these UFO sightings

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:19.980
in Nevada, near the testing areas.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:25.357
Jet engine propulsion,
a reach of 2,000 miles,

00:13:25.357 --> 00:13:27.648
start and landing all by itself,

00:13:27.648 --> 00:13:31.497
stealth is optical stealth -
you can't see it - and ...

00:13:32.107 --> 00:13:34.411
the kill decision,

00:13:34.411 --> 00:13:38.261
which is required by United States law
to be made by human beings -

00:13:38.261 --> 00:13:42.745
human beings must be in the loop
before someone is killed by a drone -

00:13:42.745 --> 00:13:46.586
is in the machine,
and it doesn't need people.

00:13:46.586 --> 00:13:51.506
It can decide by itself
whether or not it kills somebody.

00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:56.181
The experts say it's going to make
less mistakes and less collateral damage

00:13:56.181 --> 00:13:58.211
than the human decisions.

00:13:59.121 --> 00:14:03.121
The kill decision in robots in the air,
in robots on the ground,

00:14:03.121 --> 00:14:07.931
in robots in the water or underwater,
where there are also drones,

00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:11.441
is made by or can be made by machines.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:15.072
In my book, I quote many official
United States government documents

00:14:15.072 --> 00:14:19.612
which say, "Our goal is to have
the kill decision made by them."

00:14:19.612 --> 00:14:23.762
The problem is,
artificial intelligence sometimes ...

00:14:26.118 --> 00:14:27.948
makes mistakes.

00:14:28.214 --> 00:14:30.754
This is Talon, an automatic cannon.

00:14:30.754 --> 00:14:33.764
You can put a lot
of ammunition in that thing,

00:14:33.764 --> 00:14:35.784
and you can also put rockets on it.

00:14:35.784 --> 00:14:38.564
It's in Iraq since 2007.

00:14:38.734 --> 00:14:43.604
At a demonstration
with US generals and experts,

00:14:44.178 --> 00:14:46.588
the damn thing got out of control

00:14:46.588 --> 00:14:50.138
and started pointing at the audience.

00:14:50.638 --> 00:14:53.928
There was a marine there, thank goodness,

00:14:53.928 --> 00:14:56.968
running across the field, 
who tackled it like a football player

00:14:56.968 --> 00:14:58.718
and threw it on its side,

00:14:58.718 --> 00:15:02.568
and probably prevented
a couple hundred people from being killed.

00:15:02.931 --> 00:15:04.326
This was not a reason enough

00:15:04.326 --> 00:15:09.081
to take a lucrative contract
away from the company that built it,

00:15:09.081 --> 00:15:11.581
and it wasn't enough
to take the Talon out of Iraq.

00:15:11.581 --> 00:15:13.651
It's just sort of off-duty for a moment

00:15:13.651 --> 00:15:16.041
because, you know,

00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:20.741
there were some "early stages
of development," that kind of problem.

00:15:21.468 --> 00:15:23.929
But don't underestimate
artificial intelligence,

00:15:23.929 --> 00:15:27.649
because it's getting better every day,

00:15:28.129 --> 00:15:30.459
and it's going to scare us.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.660
I'm right at the right time,
why is it saying "stop"?

00:15:34.263 --> 00:15:38.895
Because ... This has all been
here-and-now technology,

00:15:38.895 --> 00:15:41.224
let's go to the future, not far,

00:15:41.224 --> 00:15:44.284
just a little bit
to the Internet of things,

00:15:44.284 --> 00:15:49.328
to artificial intelligence
as being spread out.

00:15:49.328 --> 00:15:52.448
It's not a central machine in a box
where you can pull the plug.

00:15:52.448 --> 00:15:55.658
Artificial intelligence is networked,
like the Internet of things,

00:15:55.658 --> 00:16:00.408
and part of it may be in a smart watch
or a refrigerator or in a supercomputer.

00:16:00.579 --> 00:16:05.129
The intelligence exists only
by networking it together.

00:16:05.503 --> 00:16:09.203
If the supercomputer needs
more computer power,

00:16:09.203 --> 00:16:11.523
it goes there and gets it
out of the Internet.

00:16:11.523 --> 00:16:15.933
If the computer needs better programs,
it goes there and gets those programs.

00:16:15.933 --> 00:16:18.273
And if it needs more
information, more data,

00:16:18.273 --> 00:16:20.033
it goes there and gets more data.

00:16:20.033 --> 00:16:23.553
It sets up a spontaneous
network for its needs,

00:16:23.553 --> 00:16:26.855
which collapses
when it no longer needs it.

00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:31.126
It does this without us.

00:16:31.432 --> 00:16:35.522
You have to imagine there are these
intelligence nodes all over the place,

00:16:35.522 --> 00:16:38.692
and they're like drops
of mercury on a glass table.

00:16:38.782 --> 00:16:41.762
They will find their way to each other.

00:16:41.762 --> 00:16:44.452
They will find their way together.

00:16:45.301 --> 00:16:48.681
Now, we have to be very careful

00:16:48.681 --> 00:16:52.921
because survival is an issue
for artificial intelligence.

00:16:53.177 --> 00:16:54.407
It needs to exist

00:16:54.411 --> 00:16:58.187
to be able to do the things
it wants to do according to its program.

00:16:58.187 --> 00:17:01.413
So it lays, like insect eggs,

00:17:01.413 --> 00:17:05.217
backups in computer programs
all over the world,

00:17:05.217 --> 00:17:07.177
thousands and thousands of them,

00:17:07.177 --> 00:17:09.887
so that if we do destroy part of it,

00:17:10.651 --> 00:17:12.471
it's still alive.

00:17:12.888 --> 00:17:15.418
My job to you

00:17:16.445 --> 00:17:20.445
is the wake-up call
to make you aware of the problem.

00:17:20.977 --> 00:17:24.607
Your job is to figure out
how we're going to stop this

00:17:24.811 --> 00:17:26.731
before it kills us.

00:17:26.992 --> 00:17:28.462
Thank you.

00:17:28.462 --> 00:17:30.262
(Applause)
