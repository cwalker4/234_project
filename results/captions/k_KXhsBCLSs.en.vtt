00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.255
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.270
There are clear rules in poker.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.660
And then, there are
the unwritten rules--

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.460
the points of etiquette.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.540
And when is breached,
a discussion

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.390
may ensue, which
could become heated.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.650
Don't do it again, I don't an
apology, don't do it again.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.810
Which could result
in controversy!

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.800
Everybody except me is
really upset at him.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.150
And when there are
controversies, we have a Top 5.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.130
From the expanded
PokerStars library,

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.266
here are five times players
have crossed the invisible line.

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.760
I'm going to call.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.110
At 5, we find the usually
mellow monk, Andy Black,

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.050
giving a player a piece of
his mind in Baden back in '06.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.615
Mattias Eriksson.

00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:48.910
It's been folded round to him.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.290
And he's going to limp in.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.180
Wow, what-- he can't
possibly limp with that hand.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.710
I'm afraid he just has.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.110
And Andy Black's all in again.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.318
This time I have a good hand.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.330
And he doesn't.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.830
Peter's right, but he
shouldn't be saying that.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.937
Strictly speaking, Andy's hand
is better than Eriksson's.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.720
Well he can't possibly call.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.465
No, he's doing this
for Andy's benefit,

00:01:17.465 --> 00:01:20.816
to just let him stew do a little
bit while he thinks about it.

00:01:20.816 --> 00:01:21.940
But no, he's going to fold.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:34.990
Better dwelling.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.070
Better TV time.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.890
And his cards go in the muck.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.390
Don't make comments
during the hand.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.140
Andy's kicked off.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.810
It's really bad.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.125
And he's right, of course.

00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:45.625
You know?

00:01:45.625 --> 00:01:47.080
Yeah, you're right.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.006
I was just joking.

00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:49.130
No no, but it's not a joke.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.629
Yeah?

00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:50.320
You're right.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.010
It's not a joke.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.866
Oh, he's not acting.

00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.740
That's the second time
he's done that, right?

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.156
He's extremely
unhappy about this.

00:01:55.156 --> 00:01:57.690
You made a comment which
could influence the pot, yeah?

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.440
You can't do that.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.986
Oh, he doesn't have a good hand.

00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:01.152
You should better than that.

00:02:01.152 --> 00:02:02.420
You right then, I apologize.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.420
Just don't do it again.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.651
I don't want an apology,
don't do it again.

00:02:05.651 --> 00:02:07.900
This coming from the guy who
moved all in out of turn.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.659
Well, you know,
sometimes you just

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:11.200
get caught in the
heat of the moment.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.950
It is annoying.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.480
It's OK.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.438
Just don't do it again.

00:02:14.438 --> 00:02:16.792
I know you're, you
know, I know forgot,

00:02:16.792 --> 00:02:18.070
but please don't forget again.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.500
He's apologized, Andy, move on.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.830
--affect the destination of
this tournament, you know?

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.095
Oh, I felt that he needed--

00:02:23.095 --> 00:02:24.970
All right, let's just
deal the cards, fellas.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.446
Next hand.

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:27.700
So which was worse?

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.440
The crime or the punishment?

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.620
Andy makes a fair point.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.860
Poker etiquette is
there for a reason.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.050
Certain things can
influence the flow

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.950
of the hand, even an honest
mistake like number 4--

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.530
from the Million
Dollar Cash Game.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.105
Think the 1,200, we're going
to see Mike at least call this.

00:02:47.105 --> 00:02:49.230
And we haven't seen him
raise those kind of hands--

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.771
and he calls.

00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:51.710
He stays true to
form and just calls.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.480
You-- you're a guy--

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.021
He probably finds, there's just
too many of the other players

00:02:58.021 --> 00:02:58.609
like to raise.

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.400
Remember what I told
you I was going to do?

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.890
You remember?

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.126
So we got pocket
6's, pocket 5's.

00:03:06.126 --> 00:03:07.834
You're the only one
that has me beat too.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.671
That's a raise already form Tom.

00:03:14.671 --> 00:03:16.170
I think if Phil
calls this, he could

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.110
bring in the rest of the table.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.030
Well, he has.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.260
There's enough marginal
hands out there that--

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.750
Actually, I was going to raise
12,000, so you save money.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.980
Pretty sure Matusow and
Benyamine are going to call.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.040
They both have pocket pairs.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.180
And if Phil Ivey
calls, that could

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.440
bring in every single person.

00:03:40.854 --> 00:03:43.270
Phil Ivey the first player in
the Million Dollar Cash Game

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.270
history with over $1
million in front of him.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.810
And he wants more.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:50.590
He calls that bet.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.980
--you're such a bad beat for me.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.178
I was going to raise 12,000,
he was going to re-raise me

00:03:54.178 --> 00:03:56.110
and I was just going to
get 200,000 this hand.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.070
And you had--

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.210
9,600 more.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.755
Or whatever it is.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:04.870
Patrik decides to go.

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:10.850
Mike's been relatively tight,
but he's got the kind of hand--

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.400
he knows if he catches,
it could get the lot.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.900
So he's called.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.360
That's exactly why he's called.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.700
If he can hit his magical 6.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.470
Benyamine raises.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.820
Don't ever call me a coward.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.430
I was folding this hand too.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.370
How much do you have, Mike?

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.246
I had 250 starting the hand.

00:04:34.246 --> 00:04:35.370
Now we're playing the game.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.070
I mean it was getting
a little slow.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.790
Wow!

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.410
What a flop for 10-jack!

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.540
[INAUDIBLE] at all.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.460
I mean, what am I doing?

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.310
I've got the maniac
kid on my right--

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.810
33,800--

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.050
--and I didn't re-raise
him before the flop.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.591
--is the bet.

00:04:54.591 --> 00:04:57.840
I deserve-- I guess
I deserve to lose.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.810
Looks like-- I
can't imagine he's

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.350
going to get a caller here.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.850
There isn't actually that much
for any of the other players.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.641
Phil Ivey's got a pair
and a straight draw,

00:05:05.641 --> 00:05:07.670
so maybe he'll get
a call from him.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.574
It is bottom pair, though.

00:05:09.574 --> 00:05:11.490
I am so-- this is really
bad, I am so calling.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.350
That was pretty bad, yeah.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.141
I don't see-- where's
it-- who's-- look it!

00:05:14.141 --> 00:05:15.699
Can anybody see his
cards over here?

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:16.990
That's all right, Mike, we'll--

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.720
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.594
--would you able to see
his cards right here?

00:05:22.237 --> 00:05:24.680
It's OK, they knew he
was holding anyway.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.414
Mike, we know you needed
a deuce, 3, or 4 anyway.

00:05:28.414 --> 00:05:30.330
No, I mean, you talk
about your hand, I mean--

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.830
I didn't say anything
about my hand,

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.950
I mean, I just thought
he was folding.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.390
You don't know who's in the pot?

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.360
Well, you have 17
chips on red card.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.162
You don't know who's in the
pot at the beginning of a pot?

00:05:40.162 --> 00:05:41.870
You come over here
and if you can see it,

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:42.300
I'll give you 10,000--

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.180
I bet that if I was over
there, I would know that--

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.480
You can see his cards--

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.380
--that I was in the pot.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.540
10,000 says you can't see
your cards sitting right here.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.123
You got a bet.

00:05:48.123 --> 00:05:49.760
10,000 says I know
everybody who is

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.110
in the pot from the beginning.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.819
I apologize, but there's no
way you could see your cards.

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:57.110
Well Mike's passed out of turn.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.530
You want to bet 10,000?

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.270
That I always know
who's in the pot?

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.030
I know who's in the pot
but I thought you folded.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.520
For the rest of the session.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.770
I can't see your cards.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.837
Your cards are all
hidden by the red chips.

00:06:05.837 --> 00:06:08.172
OK.

00:06:08.172 --> 00:06:09.822
Now where was I?

00:06:09.822 --> 00:06:12.024
A lot of money at stake.

00:06:12.024 --> 00:06:13.065
Tempers starting to rise.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.986
Pot is 90,000.

00:06:17.986 --> 00:06:20.220
And It's 33,000 to call.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.680
Of course, it really should
be Tom Dwan that Mike Matusow

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.778
should be apologizing to.

00:06:27.778 --> 00:06:29.420
What we go, 33?

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.140
3,800.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:38.700
It's-- he's giving Phil
Ivey free information.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.680
He knows that Mike
Matusow's not going

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.010
to raise or play behind him.

00:06:50.491 --> 00:06:51.740
Phil Ivey going to give it up.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:52.670
Fold?

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.250
I think he was the only
potential customer here unless

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.157
David wants to be
creative, he doesn't.

00:06:57.157 --> 00:06:58.221
Fold.

00:06:58.221 --> 00:06:59.220
Tom takes that one down.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.284
He's a bit unfortunate no one
else caught any of that flop.

00:07:03.284 --> 00:07:05.970
Oh, what is going on here?

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.550
7-8-9 might have been
a better flop for him.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.310
The 8-10 might have
felt a bit stronger,

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.580
and the pocket 6's
might have even played.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.340
There were at least three
etiquette infractions

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.660
in that hand.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.310
But the real controversy?

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.560
Those graphics!

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.800
Am I right?

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.250
And number 3 is
from Prague in 2015

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.430
and asks the question--
what is a call not a call?

00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:34.360
Ah, Gleb's raise of a
super small river bet

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.920
got a fold before.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.870
Pretty good reason to
think it might work again.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.780
As the bluff from
Tremzin, 2.3 million.

00:07:49.974 --> 00:07:51.640
It doesn't look like
it's going to work.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.340
Ensan re-raises.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.352
Good call.

00:07:57.352 --> 00:07:57.940
You call?

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:58.610
Yep.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.950
You win.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.069
I've just 5.

00:08:02.069 --> 00:08:03.461
5.

00:08:03.461 --> 00:08:03.961
Yeah.

00:08:03.961 --> 00:08:04.753
It was a good call.

00:08:04.753 --> 00:08:06.252
I think there's
some confusion here.

00:08:06.252 --> 00:08:07.960
I think Gleb thought
Ensan was calling.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.904
Ut oh.

00:08:09.904 --> 00:08:11.250
Oh I win.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.940
Yeah.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:14.591
Yes.

00:08:14.591 --> 00:08:15.090
I win.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:18.020
[INAUDIBLE] of 6.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:18.810
I said good call.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.500
He raised to--

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.000
Call.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.600
You call.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.700
No no, I said good call.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.960
I call-- I raise!

00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:29.270
Hey, man, I called.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.900
I called.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:30.400
I called.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.050
I called.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:31.860
I called.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:32.820
I say I called.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.197
Uh, floor?

00:08:35.197 --> 00:08:37.159
Um.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.010
Did you hear a call?

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.970
He bet 400.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:41.240
Of course I'm not calling.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.159
We say--

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:42.970
He's saying raise.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:43.960
He's saying raise.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.940
No, you said raise--

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.470
He didn't say raise.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.466
Raise, my friend.

00:08:49.466 --> 00:08:50.340
You said call.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.660
I said good call,
not that I'm calling.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.256
How can I call with 8-4?

00:08:56.256 --> 00:08:57.590
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:58.990
Well this is awkward.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.420
Let's go back to the tape
and hear what Gleb said.

00:09:05.028 --> 00:09:05.930
Good call.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.270
Good call.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.170
You win.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:12.129
He thought Ensan was calling
and he praised him on his call.

00:09:12.129 --> 00:09:12.629
Yeah.

00:09:12.629 --> 00:09:13.469
It was good call.

00:09:13.469 --> 00:09:15.094
So I'm going to turn
these cards over--

00:09:15.094 --> 00:09:18.060
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.964
OK, gentlemen.

00:09:19.964 --> 00:09:21.580
It's OK.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:22.730
I don't want more.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:23.755
It's OK.

00:09:23.755 --> 00:09:24.535
It's OK.

00:09:24.535 --> 00:09:25.660
Of course I'm not calling--

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.190
No no no, I don't want.

00:09:30.139 --> 00:09:30.680
It's OK, man.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.530
Yet another amazing
display of sportsmanship.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:34.416
Just be careful.

00:09:34.416 --> 00:09:34.915
Yeah, yeah.

00:09:34.915 --> 00:09:35.250
It's OK

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:35.875
Sorry for that.

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:36.950
It's my mistake, but--

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.410
But next time
please don't bluff.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:41.892
[LAUGHS]

00:09:41.892 --> 00:09:43.870
It's not good.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.670
But you bluff also.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:46.697
I have 5!

00:09:46.697 --> 00:09:48.982
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:48.982 --> 00:09:50.620
It was [INAUDIBLE] flop.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:51.856
You have nothing.

00:09:51.856 --> 00:09:53.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:56.200
Good call is probably
the last complement

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.360
Gleb Tremzin has ever given.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.390
That's what you
get for being nice.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.750
Number 2 has some
super high roller

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:08.170
hijinks and a questionable
play from Daniel Negreanu.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.520
Welcome to the table, everybody.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.070
Ace-king for Daniel Negreanu.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.290
Oh, apparently someone
other than Steve Silverman

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.420
is allowed to pick up a hand.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.820
Negreanu raises.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.172
And raises back!

00:10:20.172 --> 00:10:22.525
Oops!

00:10:22.525 --> 00:10:25.360
29, buddy!

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.874
45 for you, not 29.

00:10:26.874 --> 00:10:28.290
45?

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:29.710
It's so nice.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:30.760
I mean, it's pretty nice!

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.610
I thought it was 29 first, too.

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.570
Oh [BLEEP].

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:39.120
That is an 11x
raise from Daniel.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.290
And an apparent misclick.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.410
Weird.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.530
How much you playing?

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.324
350, so about 4.

00:10:48.324 --> 00:10:50.490
Oh man, this could get real
ugly for Steve Silverman

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:54.510
if he reads Daniel's
sheepishness for weakness.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.980
He's got king-jack suited.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.450
He's got everyone at
the table covered.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:59.950
Maybe he won't go
too crazy, though,

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.480
because it's clear
Daniel did want

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.820
to raise in the
first place, he just

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.111
didn't want to raise that much.

00:11:06.446 --> 00:11:07.820
This spot is
weirder than walking

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:12.260
into a room where people have
just been talking about you.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:12.830
All in.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:14.150
Silverman shoves!

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:15.210
Whoops.

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:16.490
And Negreanu calls.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:16.990
All in.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:18.166
Wooow.

00:11:18.166 --> 00:11:18.790
Did you get me?

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.800
No, I have ace-king, but--

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.500
He got you.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.010
OK.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.510
This is the biggest
pot of the tournament.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.126
That really was a misclick.

00:11:26.126 --> 00:11:27.500
The mystic may
have been genuine,

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.850
but him feeling bad about
it definitely isn't.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.720
Well it's mainly
spades on the flop.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.800
9-6-4.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.900
So far, so good for Negreanu.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.200
Only three cards capable
of saving Silverman.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.064
Finally got that one in!

00:11:44.064 --> 00:11:44.880
Pfft!

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:45.724
Hey!

00:11:45.724 --> 00:11:46.640
You have clubs, right?

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.973
Oh, OK, I thought it was spades.

00:11:47.973 --> 00:11:48.830
Man.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:50.570
Now he needs a queen or a jack?

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.420
Correct.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.140
It's running hot.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:54.640
Huh?

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:55.986
It's dangerous.

00:11:55.986 --> 00:11:57.910
It's very dangerous
against this guy.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.110
He's running to it, huh?

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.340
The river is an ace.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.950
I got 438-5.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.780
Negreanu doubles up.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.340
He wins a massive pot.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:10.010
He's chip leader once again
by a considerable margin.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:11.380
Misclick you say?

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.990
You're suspect, Negreanu.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.260
You're suspect.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.620
The question is, did I do it on
purpose to trap the big blind?

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.824
Or did I just do what's
called a misclick?

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:23.240
Raising to larger
size than normal

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.055
and then talking about
how it's a misclick

00:12:25.055 --> 00:12:27.430
and how you meant to make it
nine, if that's not actually

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.680
the case, I think that's
a little bit shady.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.202
That really was a misclick.

00:12:32.202 --> 00:12:33.910
I have no problem with
that sort of move,

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.743
it's all part of the
psychology of the game.

00:12:35.743 --> 00:12:37.870
And you have to guess for
yourself whether or not

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:38.650
I'm acting or not.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:40.674
It's part of the game.

00:12:40.674 --> 00:12:42.090
We played a pot
for the chip lead.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:46.180
Very big pot that basically
just shouldn't have happened.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.250
One of the things about
being a good poker player

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:52.260
is you got to keep your
cards close to the vest.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.910
It's hard to give
someone credit when

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:56.310
you find out they have priors.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.490
Like our number 1
controversial play--

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:07.129
it's the now infamous angle
shoot from Madrid 2011.

00:13:07.129 --> 00:13:09.420
You might be wondering if he
can get away with a raise.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.160
The board's pretty
dry, however, so he'd

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.690
be repping a very strong hand.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:18.860
He makes just a call.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.150
The turn card is
another 5, Freitez

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:27.470
continues to run golden.

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:31.940
Freitez runs better
than Usain Bolt.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.550
Goes check, check, and a 6
on the river giving Freitez

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:35.930
a full house.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:36.922
Freitez boats up.

00:13:36.922 --> 00:13:38.630
I think he missed some
value on the turn,

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:41.499
but I doubt he'll be
checking behind this time.

00:13:41.499 --> 00:13:43.040
It's going be really
tough for Eugene

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.854
to not think he
has the best hand.

00:13:44.854 --> 00:13:46.270
He's going to put
out a value bet.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:51.008
275,000.

00:13:51.008 --> 00:13:52.870
How much?

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.140
A little Hollywooding, maybe.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:07.730
Re-raise.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:10.690
Raise coming.

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:11.846
I'm sorry, I call.

00:14:11.846 --> 00:14:12.346
What?

00:14:12.346 --> 00:14:13.500
Whoa, whoa.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.312
Uh-oh.

00:14:15.312 --> 00:14:16.220
I call.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.210
He said raise.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.526
You announced raise.

00:14:18.526 --> 00:14:19.318
I no speak English.

00:14:19.318 --> 00:14:20.151
You announced raise.

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:21.220
No speak English?

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.710
No way he meant to just
call with the full house.

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.610
That was not a mistake.

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:29.140
Thomas Kremser's has
been called to the table.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.430
I believe we're looking
at an angle shoot here.

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.880
Freitez knows the rule as
that his raise must stand.

00:14:37.114 --> 00:14:38.530
And I think he's
trying to make it

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:41.170
look like he didn't want to
raise so he'll get a call out

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:42.780
of Eugene.

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.530
I think that is exactly
the same situation

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.814
that we had already in
this tournament when

00:14:46.814 --> 00:14:49.167
you did exactly the same
move when you had the nuts.

00:14:49.167 --> 00:14:50.750
I'm just sharing
information with you.

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:51.680
OK?

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.310
Wow.

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.185
Freitez has got
previous for this.

00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:54.810
You understand?

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:56.655
So I force you to
raise now and you have

00:14:56.655 --> 00:14:58.320
the option, what do you do?

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:02.760
Twice, then you need
to put in another 275.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.310
I think this is well-handled
by Thomas Kremser.

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:07.090
He's forcing Freitez
to min-raise,

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:09.870
but he's told Eugene Yanayt
that this is a move that Freitez

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.050
makes when he's got a monster.

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:12.707
So what--

00:15:12.707 --> 00:15:14.040
Because of what happened before.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.370
Oh, you force him to min-raise?

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:15.870
Yeah.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:17.310
OK.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:19.265
It's not my option
whether or not he raises,

00:15:19.265 --> 00:15:20.300
it's my option what
to do now, right?

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:20.960
That what you're saying?

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.460
Yeah.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:22.205
OK, understand.

00:15:22.205 --> 00:15:24.330
Armed with that information,
does Eugene Yanayt now

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:25.669
fold top pair?

00:15:25.669 --> 00:15:27.960
I know we're not supposed to
actively root for players,

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.760
but I sure hope he mucks.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.070
Make Freitez look like a chump.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.106
He makes the call.

00:15:37.106 --> 00:15:38.510
Freitez shows the full house.

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.230
That's what-- the
same situation again.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.610
No, I know.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.220
I heard about this before
the tournament started.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.250
It is so ugly, I can't tell you.

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.750
Ugly.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:46.124
Move was so dirty, I feel
like I need a shower.

00:15:46.124 --> 00:15:47.540
I heard about this
guy a week ago.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.540
I'm sorry?

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.956
I heard about this
guy a week ago.

00:15:49.956 --> 00:15:51.120
It's OK.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.927
I've never seen Thomas
Kremser look so disgusted.

00:15:53.927 --> 00:15:56.510
Speaking of disgusted, look at
the other players at the table.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:59.111
Look at Juan Maceiras.

00:15:59.111 --> 00:16:01.610
You know, back in the old days,
running an angle shoot could

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:04.190
get you actually shot.

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:07.465
Controversially, that's
the end of our Top 5.

00:16:07.465 --> 00:16:08.340
It's all right, MIke.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:09.160
We know a deuce--

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.330
Will you be able to see
his cards right here?

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:10.900
It's OK.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.400
It's OK.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.480
You should know
better that, yeah?

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:19.530
Look out for more
on pokerstars.tv.

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:23.210
I did not see that being
resolved so happily.
