00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.620
after almost a year of waiting Daisy the
mayor finally gave birth to a gorgeous

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.350
fall
however when breeders studied her after

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.360
birth what they saw made their jaws drop

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.500
Jenny Benson founded Saratoga stud in
1997 the business is based in South

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.119
Africa and focuses on breeding
high-quality horses for sport needless

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.300
to say then Benson dedicates her life to
the animals in her care

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.680
but although she attended to all her
horses equally Benson still couldn't

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.270
help but to have her favourites and
among them was one mayor named Daisy so

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.540
when in 2014
Daisy became pregnant for the first time

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.610
the breeder was over the moon Daisy had
arrived at Saratoga stud from England

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.520
and she often caught the eye of visitors
on the ranch

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.420
thanks to her beautiful Palomino
coloring that seemed therefore bred her

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.460
with one of their stallions Trello Berg
decanter the average gestation period

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.629
for horses is 11 months often for
example stallions will impregnate mares

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.580
in summer and the foals will arrive the
following spring over the passing months

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.290
then Daisy's pregnancy progressed
normally by January 2014 though the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.390
horse was a week overdue however it was
then that a stable worker rang Benson to

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.720
tell her that the mayor had gone into
labor and the breeder and her husband

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.460
arrived at the scene just in time to
witness the birth Daisy had fold a

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.799
stunning and absolutely tiny Palomino
Colt in fact the baby's size confused

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.780
Benson because his mother was quite tall
at close to 18 hands but although the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.009
colt was small Benson was delighted with
the new arrival and naturally she wanted

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.909
to support Daisy so she decided to stay
by the animal's side in the stable to

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.939
comfort her as best she could however
when Daisy began to deliver the placenta

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.939
something didn't seem right
in fact it appeared to Benson that her

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.500
beloved mare was going into labor once
again at this point Daisy became

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.219
distracted by her newborn full but
Benson was still convinced that

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.850
something was going on
so she placed her hand inside the horse

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.670
and to her amazement touch
two tiny feet with no time to lose

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.260
Benson got her husband to pull the fall
out as he did so Benson held her arms

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.219
open to catch the animal and when it
finally emerged the couple waited with

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:23.920
bated breath to see if the little
creature was alive amazingly it was

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.969
Daisy had given birth to a healthy cry
mellow filly making her the mother of

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:32.750
one boy and one girl
Benson immediately noticed that unlike

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.480
her brother
the fall was tiny but her fighting

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.829
spirit was clear for all to see
nevertheless the twins would need all

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.299
the assistance they could get if they
were to grow big and strong so Benson

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.599
helped out with bottle feeds until both
twins were suckling from their mom with

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.129
ease and at that point the breeder was
sure they both survived

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:56.269
Daisy's heartwarming story subsequently
touched many animal lovers hearts and a

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.959
facebook photo album documenting her
labor soon garnered more than a thousand

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.319
likes
wow what a miracle red would comment

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.659
below the images praying that mom and
both babies do well interestingly a

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:13.190
Quine twins are pretty rare double
pregnancies often result in miscarriages

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.540
as mares are just not physically
equipped to carry more than one baby as

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.430
a result it's thought that just one twin
pregnancy in a hundred will result in

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.599
two healthy foals but thankfully it
seems that Daisy and her babies were

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.169
among the lucky ones
Benson later decided to name the Colt

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:36.560
Don Quixote and the filly duet and in
her and her team's expert care both the

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.280
twins were soon thriving so in January
2015

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.079
Benson let the twins out for their
stable for the very first time to begin

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.949
with Benson was worried that Daisy might
abandon her babies when they were out in

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:51.650
the open
however the doting mom ensured that her

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.580
foal stayed nearby and the outing went
completely to plan

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.230
duet is catching up in size to her
brother she won't be as big as him but

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.880
we didn't think she'd grow as close in
size to him as she has already read an

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.460
update on the Saratoga stud Facebook
page in 2015 she's full of spunk and joy

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.220
and they both enjoy a good gallop around
the paddock

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.390
when let out in the morning they then
spend most of the day grazing next to

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.580
each other in May 2016 Don Quixote and
duet had blossomed into beautiful

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.350
animals they're both growing up into
spectacular young horses very mature for

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.410
their age
a Facebook post revealed you cannot

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.060
believe that these two have grown up
into these two horses Benson decided the

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.470
twins were so special that she couldn't
put them up for sale so now they're

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.970
growing up by their mother's side and
one day they'll no doubt become just as

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.010
