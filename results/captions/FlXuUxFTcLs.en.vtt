00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:10.059
Just about every two years, the planet Mars
makes its closest approach to Earth... around

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:11.059
36 million miles.

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.029
That's when we pack our robotic emissaries
off to the Red Planet, timing their launches

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:25.480
to spend the least effort to get there.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.440
Some fly around it... snapping pictures...

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.940
Others land ... to sample its surface....

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.800
...a few to crawl around its canyons and craters.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.370
These probes may pave the way for human explorers...
and, perhaps permanent settlers... who'll

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.350
dig deeper still... in search of answers to
our most pressing question:

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.820
Did Mars develop far enough - and stay that
way long enough - for life to arise?

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:07.180
And, if so, does anything live now within
Mars' dusty plains... beneath its ice caps...

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.119
or maybe somewhere underground?

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:17.310
Mars does not give up its secrets easily ... it's
almost as if the little planet is embarrassed.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.060
Over a century ago, a few observers thought
they saw clues that Mars is alive.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:33.649
In 1877, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli
noted markings... which he saw as a latticework

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.679
of lines. He called them "canali" in Italian...
meaning nothing more than "shallow channels"

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:40.679
in English.

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:47.959
American astronomer, Percival Lowell, found
the lure of these features irresistible.

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:54.340
He saw Schiaparelli's channels as artificial
canals. He speculated that they carried melting

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.270
snow from the poles to the dry interior.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.320
After all, on Earth, the Suez Canal had recently
opened to ship traffic. The Panama Canal was

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.079
beginning to be dug.

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.630
The Martian canals, Lowell said, were built
by a sophisticated society confronting an

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.430
environmental catastrophe on the grandest
of scales.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:23.250
Those Martians, he thought, must face urgent
choice: move water across vast arid regions,

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.080
or perish on an increasingly dry planet.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.060
As the 19th Century gave way to the 20th,
Lowell took his case to the public, in a series

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.150
of three best-selling books.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.390
And the public responded with... questions.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.689
Who were these Martians, who had the means
to remake an entire planet?

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:52.909
Some offered schemes for making contact. Giant
mirrors would flash greetings... Light beams...

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:54.069
Mental telepathy.

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:01.969
Many astronomers grew deeply skeptical...
but Lowell's vision of a harsh, yet Earth-like

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:06.640
planet endured in the public's imagination..

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.940
That vision was dealt harsh blow in 1964.
The Mariner Four spacecraft ventured in for

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.379
a closer look... And what it saw looked like
the Moon.

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.739
Three more Mariners followed.

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:31.150
They found huge dormant volcanoes... the deepest
and longest canyon in the solar system...but

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.480
not a trace of life, present or past.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.750
In the mid-1970's, two lander-orbiter robot
teams, named Viking, took up residence at

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.989
Mars.

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:51.340
Maybe the Martians were just hiding, so theVikings
tested the soil for signs of life.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.299
But all the evidence from Viking told us...
Mars is not only barren... but in fact hostile

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.980
to life.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:08.090
It's no wonder. Martian air temperatures range
from -20 degrees Fahrenheit to down below

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.090
-200.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.339
It's also very, very dry. The Sahara Desert
on Earth is a rainforest, by comparison. If

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:19.720
all of the water vapor in Mars' thin atmosphere
fell as snow, it would make a layer of frost

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.120
not thicker than your fingernail.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.449
On Earth, impact craters erode over time from
wind and water... and even volcanic activity.

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.770
On Mars, they can linger for billions of years.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.911
But so can the imprint of riverbeds, lake
bottoms and ocean shorelines... And the Viking

00:04:41.911 --> 00:04:44.490
orbiters saw a lot of them.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.310
It's not hard to believe that a great deal
of water once flowed here.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:55.830
But where did all the water go?

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:03.840
To find out, scientists needed to do real
field-geology on Mars. They needed rovers...

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.490
travelling robots with tools and instruments.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:20.139
In 2004, the heroic twin rovers Spirit and
Opportunity bounced down... stood up... and

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:25.612
drove off, ready to roam the Red Planet.

00:05:25.612 --> 00:05:31.009
Opportunity had come to rest in a small crater
at a spot called Meridiani Planum... and it

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.819
didn't have far to travel.

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:40.970
For here, in plain view, on the crater wall
before it was exposed bedrock... the first

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.979
ever seen on Mars.

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:50.720
Not far away, Opportunity found layered rocks
on the face of a cliff. On Earth, rocks like

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.220
these typically form in sedimentary layers
at the bottom of ancient oceans.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:04.720
And at every turn, Opportunity rolled across
tiny, smooth, almost perfectly round pellets...

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:11.110
called "blueberries" because they appeared
dark bluish-brown against Mars' rust-colored

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.110
surface.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:20.180
Initially thought to be volcanic in origin,
these blueberries proved to be iron-rich spherules

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:27.349
of exactly the type formed within cavities
at the bottom of an ocean.

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:32.180
And the rovers has another trick up their
mechanical sleeves; they could drill into

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:38.040
the rock itself... brush it clean ... and
nuzzle a spectrometer right up to the virgin

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.460
minerals.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:46.020
They found that up to 40% of the rocks were
sulfate salt... a tracer for standing water.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:53.379
That wasn't the only evidence. Spirit's broken
wheel, dragging behind it, exposed soils saturated

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:54.669
in salt.

00:06:54.669 --> 00:07:01.780
Clearly these rocks formed in water. But how
long ago? And, if you needed to find water

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.030
on Mars right now, where would you look?

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:12.700
One answer... the North Pole. From orbit,
it seemed to be covered in frozen carbon dioxide

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:17.699
 - what we call dry ice. But might water ice
exist below the surface?

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:36.470
Enter Mars Phoenix... a lander that arrived
at the North Pole in early 2008.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.470
Phoenix used rockets, not airbags, to touch
down in what appears to be the floor of an

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:38.470
ancient ocean.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:44.069
The lander's descent thrusters blew away the
top layer of soil, and Phoenix snapped some

00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:50.080
pictures. It sure looked like ice.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:57.620
Mission managers instructed the robot to conduct
a simple experiment... reach out, dig a trench...

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.750
then watch what happens.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:08.130
As expected, clumps of white stuff appeared.
A couple of days later, it was gone... vaporized.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:16.310
That means it can't be salt. Or frozen carbon
dioxide, which is stable in the cold dry temperatures

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:17.719
of the Martian pole.

00:08:17.719 --> 00:08:22.979
So it had to be water... the first ever directly
seen on Mars.

00:08:22.979 --> 00:08:30.280
In fact, Phoenix probably saw droplets of
liquid salty water form and merge on its legs.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:35.810
And there are other indications that the North
Pole was actually warm enough in the recent

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:37.600
past for water to become liquid.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:47.020
Beginning in November of 2006, Mars Reconnaissance
Orbiter flew over the pole, sending out radar

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.890
pulses to peer beneath the surface.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:56.630
These data have revealed that the ice cap,
just over a mile thick, formed in a succession

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:03.420
of layers as the climate alternated between
warm and cold.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:09.150
Martian mood swings like this happen because
the planet's spin is not stabilized by a massive

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:15.890
moon, like that of Earth. Mars can really
wobble, with one pole tilting toward the sun

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.810
for long periods.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:25.670
Whatever water's here now, is tiny compared
to what once was. There's a growing body of

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:30.820
evidence that early in its history, Mars was
on track to become positively Earth-like.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.370
But something went horribly wrong.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:43.660
Not long after its birth, the planet's molten
interior welled up to spawn volcanoes and

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:50.511
hot springs... spewing gas that formed an
early atmosphere.

00:09:50.511 --> 00:09:57.570
As the atmosphere thickened, carbon dioxide
began to trap heat from sunlight; in other

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.690
words, the classic greenhouse effect.

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:06.700
Temperatures rose high enough to allow liquid
water to flow on the surface.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:11.700
What then caused these waterways to evaporate...
and the planet to grow cold and dry?

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:18.860
In search of the answer, the Mars Global Surveyor
spacecraft was brought down to a low altitude...

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.380
and it made an intriguing detection.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:29.410
MGS documented the presence of a small magnetic
field emanating from the planet.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.700
It's incredibly weak compared to that of Earth.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:38.270
Our magnetic field is generated by molten
rock deep in Earth's core that rises and falls

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:42.870
into a huge region below the outer curst,
called the mantle.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:49.390
That has turned our planet into an electric
dynamo... the rising and sinking motion within,

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:55.750
combined with the spinning motion of the planet,
generates a strong magnetic field.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:59.990
This field is strong enough, and extends far
enough into space, to deflect the wind of

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:04.100
high-energy solar particles... protecting
Earth and its atmosphere.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:11.060
In its early years, Mars too appears to have
had a robust magnetic field.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:16.310
Rocks in some of the older craters bear a
strong imprint of this field.... While newer

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:19.360
ones indicate a much weaker field.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:25.620
So what caused Mars' magnetic field to drain
away... exposing the planet to solar winds?

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:34.810
The answer lies in its violent past... a past
that today is still written on the landscape.

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:40.800
This is a simple elevation map of Mars' surface,
from data gathered by the Mars Odyssey spacecraft.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.990
The south pole, colored in orange and red,
is piled high with ice that comes and goes

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:48.360
with the seasons.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.760
Moving off these southern highlands, we make
our way north.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:56.730
The landscape is pocked with craters. The
largest and oldest ones have slowly faded,

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.850
softened by windblown dust.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:05.840
We now pass into the Tharsis region, along
the equator. Here, on a vast high altitude

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.750
plateau, are a series of enormous volcanoes...

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:17.630
...including the largest one in our solar
system, Olympus Mons.

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:23.350
Just to the East is the great Valles Marineris.
It's named for the Mariner Nine mission that

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:31.610
found this vast gash in the Martian landscape.
It's about 2500 miles long and up to 400 miles

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:37.460
wide.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:43.660
Dust devils sweep along the plains above it...

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:54.830
And dust blows up the valley slopes. We can
see this incredible landform in a realistic

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.740
rendering of the data.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:02.710
Giant landslides have caused the walls to
slump off and pile onto the valley floor.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:06.430
Feeding into this valley: a maze of side channels.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:12.190
Scientists think these and other tributary
features were formed when water underground

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:19.200
flowed into the main basin, and the land above
collapsed.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.800
Wider parts of the canyon are regarded as
possible landing sites for human missions.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:31.260
They offer flat surfaces... and possibly access
to liquid water that may remain below the

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.880
surface even today.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.330
From the layers of rock that line the canyon
walls... and layers of dust on the canyon

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:44.770
floor... future science prospectors can fill
in details of the planet's history.

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:50.910
The theory is that the great Valles Marineris
formed early in Mars' history, as the planet

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:57.070
cooled. Its huge sides were pulled apart as
the Tharsis region, just to the west, began

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:58.560
to rise up.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:07.300
But there seems to have been another, much
larger event that changed Mars' course forever.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:13.260
Travel north, down the slopes of Mars's great
volcanoes. The elevation drops as we dive

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:17.000
into what appears to have been an immense
ocean.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:24.990
With this vast basin in the north, and the
very high elevations of the South, Mars is

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.150
a lopsided planet.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:32.510
And here's why:

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:39.550
Early on, when the Solar System was young,
Mars was apparently hit by at least 15 large

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:40.550
asteroids.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:46.650
One of them was large enough to turn most
of Mars' northern hemisphere into one huge

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:52.530
impact feature.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.600
Earth, too, was walloped by objects this big.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:59.950
But because Mars is small, only about half
the size of Earth - and has only about a third

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:07.130
Earth's surface area - ... the effect would
have been much more profound... and long-lasting.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:20.040
The thinking is that these impacts heated
the outer subsurface layer of the planet,

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:27.680
the "mantle." That prevented molten rock in
its core from rising up... and switched off

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:33.160
Mars' magnetic field...probably forever.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:39.870
Without its electromagnetic "deflector shield,"
solar radiation began to lash the planet...

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:46.170
gradually stripping it of its atmosphere...
and thus it's blanket of warm air. What water

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:55.030
Mars had would have vaporized into space...
or frozen underground.

00:15:55.030 --> 00:16:00.350
Proof that Mars once had a thicker atmosphere
may have landed, literally, in Opportunity's

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.920
backyard.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:09.140
Just recently, it spied a strange bluish rock...
a nickel iron meteorite, sitting out on the

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:12.290
surface.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:17.860
Streaking through a thin atmosphere, this
massive a chunk of metal should have made

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:25.081
a much bigger dent. But a much more dense
atmosphere would have slowed its fall and

00:16:25.081 --> 00:16:32.960
melted it in just the way that Opportunity
now sees it.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.050
Now there are a few competing theories that
explain the disappearance of Mars magnetic

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:38.160
field and its atmosphere.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:45.050
What's certain is that at some point early
in its history, the Red Planet grew increasingly

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:50.120
desolate... and that the tragedy happened
fairly quickly.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:56.120
The Martian landscape we see today is replete
with coded signals from those early times...

00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:05.589
ancient riverbeds and lake bottoms, flood
plains, and volcanic cones... as well as the

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:07.510
clear battering it received from impacts.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:11.819
But is Mars a dead world?

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:19.529
An infrared telescope on Hawaii's Mauna Kea
volcano was trained on Mars over several years.

00:17:19.529 --> 00:17:24.990
Astronomers used a spectrometer to split the
light into its individual wavelengths... to

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:28.370
identify chemical fingerprints in Mars' atmosphere.

00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:34.789
They found the signature of methane gas, in
amounts that change from place to place.

00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:40.840
Methane wouldn't last very long under Mars'
conditions... there must be some source that

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.240
replenishes it.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:49.649
That source could be biological... perhaps
microbes alive and well somewhere underground.

00:17:49.649 --> 00:17:56.009
Or the methane could be coming from volcanic
activity... or maybe chemical reactions in

00:17:56.009 --> 00:17:58.850
Mars' crust.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:05.029
So far, neither the satellites flying over
Mars... nor the robots on the surface... have

00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:09.029
turned up anything close to clear proof of
living organisms.

00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:16.140
It may take the searching eyes, flexible minds,
and nimble fingers of human explorers to find

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.509
that buried treasure, if it exists.

00:18:17.509 --> 00:18:26.240
In the meantime, we are finding that even
if Mars appears dead, it's certainly not dull.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:34.279
Though Mars has nowhere near the dynamism
of Earth, with our oceans... turbulent atmosphere...

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:40.700
volcanism... and shifting continents... Mars
does do some fascinating things:

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:47.930
If you take an atmosphere, however tenuous...
add heat from the sun so it blows over the

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:52.269
dry plains... you get the renowned dust devils
of Mars.

00:18:52.269 --> 00:18:57.490
With no trees to hold down the soil ... landslides
are common.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:03.779
The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has returned
images showing that Mars is actively remaking

00:19:03.779 --> 00:19:06.059
its surface...

00:19:06.059 --> 00:19:09.899
Not in canals built by the Martian engineers
of Percival Lowell's imagination...

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:15.460
But in picturesque sand dunes shaped by the
wind...

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:21.090
And in intricate landscapes molded by a gradually
changing climate...

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:30.309
Whether or not we ever find life-forms on
Mars, we can still marvel at the beauty of

00:19:30.309 --> 00:19:34.830
its landforms... subtly sculpted over eons
of time...

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:50.110
on a world that never was.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:54.470
