00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.200
Your true wealth is your time and freedom.  Money is just a tool for trading your time.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.800
It's a container to store your economic energy until you're ready to deploy it.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.600
But the whole world has been turned away from real money and has been fooled into using currency, -

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.300
a deceiptful imposter that is silently stealing your two most valuable assets.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.900
Your time and your freedom.  Welcome to the rabbit hole.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.300
We are entering a period of financial crisis that is the greatest the world has ever known.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.860
The wealth transfer that will take place during this decade is the greatest wealth transfer in history.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.400
Wealth is never destroyed.  It is merely transferred.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.000
And that means that on the opposite side of every crisis there is an opportunity.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:00.600
The great news is that all you have to do to turn this crisis into your great opportunity is to educate yourself.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.000
I believe that the best investment that you can make in your lifetime is your own education.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.400
Education on the history of money.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.100
Education on finance.  Education on how the global economy works.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.100
Education on how all of these guys, the central bankers, the stock market, how they can cheat you.  How they can scam you.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:31.500
If you learn what is going on and how the financial world works, you can put yourself on the correct side of this wealth transfer.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.100
Winston Churchill once said that the further you look into the past, the further that you can see into the future.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.100
This program is all about creating your own crystal ball.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.600
Being able to gaze into the future.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:51.900
Being able to change this crisis, the greatest crisis in the history of mankind, into your great opportunity.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.200
The hidden secrets of money.  Some of them are hidden in plain sight.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.300
They're like right in front of you.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.600
Uh, the way the monetary system works is something that isn't actually hidden away from all of us.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.900
It's out in the open, but it's complex and people just don't, they can't see how it works.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.900
It's hard for them to imagine that we're living in such a hoax.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.600
Others are meant to be secret, but the truth is slowly coming out.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.600
Like the Federal Reserve being a private corporation and not really part of the U.S. Government.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:49.400
But when I started studying this, uh, what I found was that there was no place that I could point people to where they could get it all in one spot.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:59.100
And so I basically decided to write my book about it and consolidate monetary history, economics, the markets, uh, the fundamentals of gold and silver.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.000
There's a lot of smoke and mirrors in economics, and I've sort of made it my job to lift the fog for people.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.240
Welcome to Egypt.  This is where it all began.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Roughly 5,000 years ago, the Egyptians started using gold and silver as their predominant form of currency,-

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.500
but it was not yet money.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.700
The pieces of gold and silver that they were using were odd sizes and weights.  Odd purities.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:43.100
So it still was not interchangable where each unit is the same as the next.  This meant that nothing really had a price yet.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.800
You couldn't put a price of so many coins on something because they didn't have coins yet.  Trade was still difficult.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.500
It was still a guessing game when it came to the exchange of values.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:06.700
One of the reasons that we are in the financial mess that we are today globally is that people do not understand the difference between currency and money.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:16.200
Currency is a medium of exchange, a unit of account.  It is portable, durable, divisible, and something called fungible.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.000
Fungible means that each unit is the same as the next unit.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.500
A dollar in my pocket buys the same amount as a dollar in your pocket.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:31.300
Money is all of those things plus a store of value over a long period of time.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.400
Even financial planners, bankers, your accountant, they don't understand the difference between currency and money.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:46.600
The currency in your pocket is a medium of exchange.  It's a unit of account because it's got numbers on it.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:53.600
It's somewhat durable, it's portable, it's divisible in that you can make change, and it's fungible.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.660
A dollar in my pocket buys the same amount as a dollar in your pocket.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:04.500
But because governments can print more and more and more of it and dilute the currency supply,-

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:12.300
it's continually transferring wealth out of your pocket, out of your bank account to the government and to the banking system.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.800
The reason that gold and silver are the optimum form of money is because of their properties.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.900
It's an easy medium of exchange because gold and silver store a large amount of value in a very small area.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.600
It's a unit of account.  Pure gold has the same value all over the planet.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.900
So an ounce of gold buys the same amount here in Egypt as it would in China or in the United States.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:47.200
It's durable.  The same gold that Egyptians were using in trade 5,000 years ago is still here with us today.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.000
It does not corrode.  It's divisible.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.100
You can make change with it.  It's very portable.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:59.700
You can use something like oil as money.  It's just that you can't carry around a barrel of oil on your back.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.100
It's fungible.  Pure gold is the same wherever it is on earth.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.500
Pure silver is the same wherever it is on earth.  It's limited in quantity.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.800
That's the  reason that it maintains its purchasing power.  Governments cannot print it.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.000
Over the last 5,000 years, only gold and silver have maintained their purchasing power.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.600
There have been thousands upon thousands of fiat currencies.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:31.600
Currencies that are unbacked by gold or silver, and they have all gone to zero.  It's a 100 percent failure rate.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:41.800
Well, fiat currency, of course, is um, a currency that is, exists at the dictate or by fiat from, from a government.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.600
They have their printing presses, and the paper money rolls off the printing presses.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.600
And then they give it the fiat designation which then makes the currency official.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.100
It's just worthless paper, but when Ben Bernake gives it the special sign, and they have the cult meeting -

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.300
at the Federal Open Market Committee meetings, it suddenly becomes currency.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.700
If you look at what's really going on it's, it's a con game.  And so there's confidence.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.700
Well, the Federal Reserve is very forthright about what they're doing.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.600
If you read their website they'll tell you it's a confidence game.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.200
They tell that there's no intrinsic value in their money.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.280
They'll tell you that they print it backed by absolutely nothing.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.300
They actually display all these facts.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:31.400
But if you tell somebody in the public that this stuff is created out of thin air, there's no backing whatsover -

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.800
, it's absolutely worthless, it's about as valuable as Monopoly money, they'll look at you like you're nuts.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:45.700
Is there an example throughout history of a fiat currency, a piece of paper that's unbacked by anything, surviving?

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.200
Short answer, no.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.400
Long answer, no.  And here's why.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.300
When Addison Wiggin took over at The Daily Reckoning, they got cranked up.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:01.200
Uh, Bill Bonner asked him to catalogue all of the fiat currencies throughout history and what happened to each of them.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:11.200
Addison dutifully went to work.  Within a short period of time he had gone through the alphabet.  All the fiat currencies that started with the letter A were done.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.800
They all went to zero.  He was halfway through the letter B and all the fiat currencies that started with the letter B,-

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:22.900
and there were 600 of them in just the first letter and a half of the alphabet.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:30.100
And every single one of them went to zero.  Every one.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:38.800
600 fiat currencies that start with the letter A, and half of the ones that start with the letter B, there are 600 of these things.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.500
Not one ever came close.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:47.600
And you think this one, the United States dollar is gonna be the first one after all that?  I don't think so.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.700
No.  No currency, fiat currency has ever survived.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.100
None.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
The thing about money is there actually is a fairly well accepted definition of what money is.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.800
The question is as you apply that definition to particular things that are, people claim to be money, do they fit the definition?

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.500
Well just take the paper dollar for example.  How well does it perform those functions?

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:18.100
Will it store a value?  Uh, the dollar has lost 95 percent of its purchasing power, uh, since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.500
So not very good as a store of value.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:26.500
One of the things I do is, uh, just a way to get the audience's attention is I have a slide and there are three pictures on the slide.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.690
One is a pile of Monopoly money.  The other one is a pile of Federal Reserve notes.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.100
Uh, what Americans would call paper money.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.200
Uh, the other one is a solid gold, uh, American Eagle, uh, one ounce coin.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.700
And the title of this slide is which of these is not like the other.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:46.200
And if you know the show Sesame Street or if you have children who watch it, it's one of the favorite vignettes in Sesame Street.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.200
And what it really is is a kind of IQ test for five year olds.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.500
They're supposed to look at the three things and look at characteristics and find the one that's not like the other.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:01.800
Well, I've shown this slide to, um, groups of, you know, Ivy League university professors, and I've also shown it to, uh, you know, uh, children.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.400
You know, kind of find results in my nieces and newphews and so forth.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:11.300
Uh, and when the, uh, professors look at it they say well, um, clearly the, uh, the dollars are not like the others -

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.800
'cause gold has no role as money and Monopoly money is junk and the American dollar is a store of value.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.400
So that's not like the other.  But the children look at it and they say well, the gold coin is not like the other -

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.600
because the other two are just piles of paper, and the gold coin is clearly something different.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.900
So my question to the audience is who's smarter?  A five year old or an Ivy League professor?

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:39.700
Before World War I, each note that a treasury issued would say that there has been deposited with the United States Treasury -

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.400
20 dollars in gold coin payable to the bearer upon demand.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:49.000
The money was in the vault.  The currency was a note they gave you that was a claim check.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:57.000
Only a claim check on the money.  The same as if you go to the dry cleaners and you give them your shirt and they give you a claim check for your shirt.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:03.900
The value is, is that shirt at the dry cleaners.  Not the piece of paper that says that you own that shirt.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:11.100
So our currency that's circulated was the paper U.S. dollars and they were claim checks on money.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.900
The next hidden secret is the difference between currency and money.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:22.800
Money must be a store of value and maintain its purchasing power over long periods of time.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:29.300
As we progress through this series, you'll learn that national currencies are really a tool used by the government -

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:35.800
and the financial sector to leach away your time and your freedom by stealing your purchasing power.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:40.300
So rather than storing your economic energy, currencies leak.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.770
Now compare that to the gold and silver the Egyptians were using.  Like I started with, it still wasn't money because it wasn't interchangable yet.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:49.700
Like I started with, it still wasn't money because it wasn't interchangable yet.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:57.000
But they were on the right track as gold and silver have proven over thousands of years to be the ultimate store of value.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:04.600
Gold is only formed when a star explodes, a supernova.  And it stays around forever.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.700
This is one of the properties that make it the ultimate money.

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:21.600
You know, people are amazed that after 5,000 years the pyramids are still here.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:28.200
But what I'm more amazed at is that the currency that the people that built this were using,-

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:34.900
that currency, that gold and silver that they were using in trade on a daily basis, is still around today.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:42.000
It may have been melted down and re-refined and it's in a coin or a bar or in some piece of jewelry.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.400
But it's still with us today and it still purchases something.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:54.800
Yes, it is the ultimate money because there is nothing else even in the same league.  It's divisible.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.400
It's permanent.  It's a store of value.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:08.200
It's, uh, a unit of account.  It's got everything you want out of money, but it doesn't go away and it can't be increased.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:14.600
That is what makes gold the most beautiful money of all.  What more can you ask out of a money?

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:19.300
It keeps governments under control.  You can maintain a solvent system.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:29.600
Governments don't like gold at present because they're getting away with the fiat currencies, and they'll do everything they can to discredit it as an asset class.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:36.100
I mean, my goodness.  Gold has, uh, outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average in each of the last seven years.

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:40.600
Uh, yet it's not considered a legitimate asset class.  Why?

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.000
Again, it's the fear that maybe gold will be imposed on the system.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.020
That it will constrain government ability to spend beyond its means.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.100
They can't print it.

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:52.700
They can't print it, no.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:14:01.800
The proper definition of inflation, I use Milton Friedman's definition.  Inflation is an expansion of the currency supply.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:10.000
Deflation is a contraction of the currency supply.  If you expand the currency supply, eventually prices will rise.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:15.600
And if you contract the currency supply, eventually prices will fall.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:20.200
This is a pool.  But it's not a pool of water.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.100
This is a, the currency pool.  And these are prices.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:31.900
And if you expand the currency supply, prices like a sponge in water have to rise to suck up the excess currency.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:38.700
Governments never stop printing more currency and adding currency to circulation.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:45.800
Therefore, prices keep on going up.  Not because they stuff that you're trying to buy is changing.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:52.200
The real estate doesn't change.  What has changed is the currency purchases less and less.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.300
It's the currency going down.  Not prices going up.

00:14:56.310 --> 00:15:01.400
The truth is, what we have that makes our world work right now is a big story.  None of it's real.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:07.000
It's all just promises.  And if you think about it, that's how currency began to work in the beginning.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.100
You know, before we had currency we had barter.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:14.100
I'll give you three coconuts and you give me four fish 'cause that's kind of a fair exchange on coconuts and fish.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:20.500
But that got complicated so we had to invent this thing called money to be a divisible, portable medium of exchange.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:27.300
And the challenge is that we've lost that a long time ago.  We lost having things of value be our currency.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.800
And now we have this thing called numbers and accounts.  But trust me.

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.850
It is not real.  It's a big made up story.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:38.900
One of the biggest make believe stories ever is called quantitative easing which sounds complex, -

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:42.600
but it's really just a smoke and mirrors term for currency creation.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.600
QE started with the banking bailouts back in 2009.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:55.600
This currency was created out of thin air and then given to the banks who paid themselves record bonuses in reward for crashing the world economy.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:03.200
This is a global phenomenon, but all you have to remember for now is that whether it's QE, bailouts, or stimulus programs, -

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:08.100
these are all just voodoo, hocus pocus terms for increased currency creation.

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:16.900
I believe gold and silver will reassert themselves as money and when they do, there just isn't enough.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:23.200
And their purchasing power is going to go up many, many, many times.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:32.600
Egypt is an amazing place.  There's a franticness about it, an utter chaos.  Especially like the traffic.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.560
When it comes to like all of the merchants that are trying to get every last dime out of you, -

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:46.700
you get fleeced to the point where you come back with an empty wallet.  [LAUGH]

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.400
But you know what?  They're amateurs compared to Wall Street.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:01.600
In the past several years, I've, I've spoken in many countries about the crisis that's coming, -

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.300
and a lot of people think that they're gonna be okay in their country.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.900
That it's only gonna happen in the United States or maybe the United States and Europe.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:12.550
Uh, but what they don't realize is that this is a global phenomenon.

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:20.600
I got to show you something here.  This is, uh, base currency in the United States.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.700
This is the number of paper dollars that exist basically.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:29.900
It took 200 years to go from no dollars in existence to 825 billion.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:36.400
And then we had the bailouts, and then we had QE1, Quantitative Easing 1.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:46.500
Then QE2.  And then we had QE3 and then QE4 and then soon we're gonna have QE57 and QE382.  [LAUGH]

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:53.600
And, uh, it isn't just here.  This is what the Canadian currency supply looks like.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:18:00.500
This is Australia.  South Africa.  Russia.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:10.000
Now this starts out in just the year 2001, and this is like 18 times more currency in existence in a little over a decade.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:17.100
Uh, here's Singapore.  Same story.  Look at that.  Since the crisis, just bam.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:23.500
India.  China.  Every government on the planet is -

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:30.000
doing this insane deficit spending and expanding their currency supplies, uh, doing bailouts.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:34.300
And history shows that there is no example of this turning out well.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:42.400
It is sometimes amazing that we haven't experienced more inflation than we have.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:49.300
If they keep expanding the money supply so vastly, why aren't our prices growing faster than they really are?

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:55.200
And the answer is that a good chunk of the money that the Fed created has been shipped overseas.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:01.500
Uh, I remember early in my research I heard this expression that the Americans have exported their inflation.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:06.100
I thought what is that?  How can you export your inflation?  Put it in a box and send it out?  What do you do?

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:13.400
Well now I understand.  You export your inflation by simply sending all these dollars that you created to these other countries -

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.600
and then they send you their refrigerators and their cars and whatever, their TV sets.

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:26.200
So you get hardware and they get little pieces of paper.  It's a great deal for the American people for a while.  For a while.

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:30.000
Sooner or later all of those pigeons come home to roost.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:37.300
When the time comes as it looks like it's now coming, when the rest of the world is saying nuh-uh we don't want to play this game anymore.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:41.500
Uncle Sam's dollars are just becoming worthless.  There are too many of them.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:48.000
We've got to find something else other than American dollars.  Then those dollars start to come back to America.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.500
People, we don't want them anymore.  What do we do with them?

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.740
Once this revs up and we've got this, this little trickle of money coming back that we'd previously exported, -

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:07.300
when, once it becomes a flood and it starts to rush back, now we are getting our former exported inflation brought back to us.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:12.700
And then we'll see the quantity of money inside the United States grow much more rapidly -

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:17.000
even than the Federal Reserve can create it because we're getting our previous money back.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:23.200
And, uh, that's when we will really see the tanking of the U.S. Dollar in terms of what it will buy.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:29.300
During the second round of quantitative easing, global food prices went up 60 percent, -

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:36.500
and this created a humanitarian disaster for the two billion people on earth who live on less than two dollars a day.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:45.900
These people were hungry to start with.  They became hungrier and some of them started overthrowing their governments in North Africa and around the Middle East.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.100
So quantitative easing was the spark that ignited the Arab Spring.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.200
So that's, that's it.  When you create money, you get some sort of inflation.

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.550
It just depends on where the inflation goes.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:15.000
Given the premise that you have a permanent underclass or poor class and how does inflation affect them disproportionately,

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:22.900
um, it affects them basically in the percentage of their income that goes to food.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.800
And we see this as a ratio, and we know that there are some danger points.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:33.800
For example in Egypt recently, once that ratio got to 40 percent of income going to food -

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:41.800
and the price of food rising due to inflation, when it got to 40 percent that's, uh, historically a point where people actually stage a revolution.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:53.800
That's exactly what we saw.  The French Revolution similarly was all around the price of food getting to a certain critical point where people simply, the risk-reward for revolution was favorable toward revolution.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.450
Well, exactly right because when you have a runaway inflation, it's punishing the very people who are most productive in society.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:11.800
In other words the people that produce more than they consume and save the difference.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.890
The problem is is that those productive people, the savers, save in their national currency -

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:23.900
and unfortunately the national currency is just a fiat piece of paper at this point.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:32.300
So when it's destroyed through runaway inflation, that 100,000 dollars that you were hoping to retire on doesn't exist.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:38.100
And the things that you were gonna buy with it and provide for others don't exist either.  Now what are you gonna do?

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:49.200
So that all seems pretty scary.  However, uh, you know, this is going to happen and you can only play the hand that you're dealt.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:55.500
But the great news is that gold and silver always end up doing an accounting of the expansion of the currency supplies.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.600
Basically the will of the public and the free markets.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.700
When governments do this kind of stuff to their currency supply, they debase it, eventually it comes back in inflation.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:11.800
People sense the loss of their puchasing power.  They rush back to gold and silver and they bid the value of -

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:17.900
the gold and silver up in the country until it meets or exceeds the value of all the currency in circulation.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:24.500
This is a process that's been going on over and over again throughout history except this time it's happening on a global scale.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.100
It has never before happened in all countries at once.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:34.400
And that means that this is the greatest wealth transfer in history.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:40.200
Therefore it's the greatest opportunity in history and it's not gonna happen again in your lifetime.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.100
So now we've learned that your true wealth is your time and your freedom.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:55.800
Money is a trading tool that stores the economic energy that is your time and freedom whereas currencies leak them away.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:59.600
Gold and silver are the ultimate money simply because of their properties.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:05.600
Fiat currencies are based solely on confidence and always return to their intrinsic value of zero.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:13.200
Governments don't like gold because it imposes restraint.  Rising prices are a symptom of an expanding currency supply -

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:17.500
and gold and silver always acocunt for an expanding currency supply.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:25.200
So that's it for this episode.  Join me next time as we begin to investigate how monetary history just repeats and repeats -

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:29.200
and how gold and silver always win the battle between currency and money.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:33.700
Until then, my challenge to you is to stop calling currency money.  It's a crucial first step towards setting your mind free of all this economic voodoo and changing your context.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.300
It's a crucial first step towards setting your mind free of all this economic voodoo and changing your context.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:46.100

Good morning.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.900
Wow.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.100
What does fiat mean?

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.800
It comes from the Latin for crappy car.

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.800
I'm in the desert in a suit.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:28.700
My camel died.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.520
You're not too sure about that are you?  Huh?

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.800
I am ready for a, a good long nap.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:46.800
Hi, welcome to this bonus feature for the very first episode of hidden secrets of money, -

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:52.500
uh, and this is currency vs money.  So that's the, uh, major topic-
