Franklin Delano Roosevelt--

CALVIN COOLIDGE: I,
Calvin Coolidge--

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:07.707
LYNDON JOHNSON: I,

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:08.708
- --do solemnly swear--

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:09.909
JOHN F. KENNEDY:
--do solemnly swear--

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:11.443
GERALD FORD: --that I
will faithfully execute--

00:00:11.543 --> 00:00:13.712
RONALD REAGAN: --the Office of
President of the United States.

00:00:13.812 --> 00:00:15.248
- It's this moment--

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:17.183
GEORGE BUSH: --and will,
to the best of my ability--

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:19.185
BILL CLINTON: --to the
best of my ability--

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:20.720
- --it's these words--

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.288
JOHN F. KENNEDY: --preserve--
JIMMY CARTER: --protect--

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:23.256
RICHARD NIXON: --and defend--

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:24.223
- --once spoken--

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:25.358
GEORGE W. BUSH:
--the Constitution

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:26.626
of the United States.

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:28.327
- --that have the
power to transform

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:30.262
any citizen into a president.

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:31.364
JOHN F. KENNEDY:
So help me, God.

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:32.198
FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT:
So help me, God.

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:33.099
BARACK OBAMA: So help me, God.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.400
- Congratulations,
Mr. President.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.769
- So don't mess it up.

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:38.404 line:0%
JOHN ROBERTS: That
I will execute

00:00:38.504 --> 00:00:41.807 line:0%
the office of President of
the United States faithfully.

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:43.943 line:0%
BARACK OBAMA: That
I will execute--

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.344 line:0%
JOHN ROBERTS:
--the-- faithfully,

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:46.946 line:0%
the President-- the Office of
President of the United States.

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:47.680 line:0%
BARACK OBAMA: --the Office
of President of the United

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.948 line:7%
States faithfully.

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:51.851 line:0%
- --the Office of the
Presidency of the United States.

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:52.785 line:7%
- Whoopsie.

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:54.820 line:7%
- --maintain and defend--

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.023 line:0%
BARACK OBAMA: --the Office of
President of the United States.

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:57.824
- Uh-oh.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:05.731
- I'm ready to
administer the oath.

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:08.101
- To tell the story of the
presidential oath of office,

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:10.970
let's start at the
beginning with this guy,

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.307
the old $1 bill himself,
George Washington,

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:16.943
or the next best thing.

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:18.711
As our nation's
first president, he

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:21.881
was the first to recite the
oath back on April 30, 1789.

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:24.050
GEORGE WASHINGTON: I,
George Washington--

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.318
- --do solemnly swear--

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:26.919
GEORGE WASHINGTON:
--do solemnly swear--

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:28.988
- The oath of office is
written into the United States

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:31.324
Constitution, and it's
the only part meant to be

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:33.326
administered word for word.

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.828 line:0%
FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT: --preserve,
protect, and defend--

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.864 line:0%
- The framers carefully
added these specific 35

00:01:38.964 --> 00:01:41.801 line:0%
words as the binding
pledge a new president

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:42.835 line:7%
makes to the country.

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:44.103
JOHN F. KENNEDY: And
I will faithfully

00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:46.539
execute the Office of
President of the United States.

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:48.407
- And Washington
was the first person

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:49.775
ever to get a crack at it.

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:51.777
GEORGE WASHINGTON: And I will,
to the best of my ability--

00:01:51.877 --> 00:01:55.114
- He took the oath at Federal
Hall in New York City.

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:58.151
But these days, most presidents
take it outside the US Capitol.

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:00.319
- --the Office of President
of the United States.

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:02.955
GEORGE BUSH: --the Office of
President of the United States.

00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:06.225
- The Constitution doesn't say
who has to administer the oath,

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:08.427
but generally, it's
the Chief Justice.

00:02:08.527 --> 00:02:10.996
- --the Constitution
of the United States.

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:13.166
- It was Washington's
idea to kiss the Bible,

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:16.402
and almost every president
after him did the same, that is,

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:19.171
until the Dwight Eisenhower
decided enough of that.

00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:23.075
He put the tradition to rest in
1953 and said a prayer instead.

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:25.411
DWIGHT EISENHOWER: --that Thou
will make full and complete.

00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:26.912
GEORGE WASHINGTON:
--so help me, God.

00:02:27.012 --> 00:02:28.948
- Now that line
is up for debate.

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:30.650 line:0%
The words "so help
me, God" are not

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.217 line:7%
written in the Constitution.

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:34.087
And historians are not
sure whether Washington

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:36.722
was the first to say them,
but most presidents have added

00:02:36.822 --> 00:02:38.057
them to the end of their oath.

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:39.425
RICHARD NIXON:
--so help me, God.

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:41.494
- Fast forward two
centuries later,

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:44.997
the oath remains a very sacred
tradition in our country.

00:02:45.097 --> 00:02:46.566
- --preserve,
protect, and defend--

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:49.001
JIMMY CARTER: --the Constitution
of the United States--

00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:51.670
RONALD REAGAN:
--so help me, God.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.106 line:0%
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY: This
is the grand theater

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:56.875 line:0%
and the grand spectacle of
watching a democracy at work,

00:02:56.976 --> 00:02:59.979 line:0%
where an entire government
hands over a baton

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.347 line:7%
to the next government.

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:05.117 line:0%
It does not happen until the
words of the oath are uttered.

00:03:05.217 --> 00:03:06.885
FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT: --that
I will faithfully execute--

00:03:06.985 --> 00:03:09.388
BILL CLINTON: --the Office of
President of the United States.

00:03:09.488 --> 00:03:11.591
RICHARD NIXON: --preserve,
protect, and defend.

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:13.126
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY:
And the words matter.

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:15.494
You have to say the
words correctly.

00:03:15.594 --> 00:03:18.297
And if it goes sideways, you're
going to have to do a do-over

00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:20.099
like Barack Obama did.

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.169
- Yep, Barack Obama
had a redo in 2009.

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.370
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY:
The oath of office

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.605
went sideways,
largely for Supreme

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:28.675
Court Justice Roberts' mistake.

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:30.576
JOHN ROBERTS: Are you prepared
to take the oath, Senator?

00:03:30.676 --> 00:03:31.944
BARACK OBAMA: I am.

00:03:32.044 --> 00:03:33.879
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY: President
Obama started taking the oath,

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.548
but Justice Roberts' language
was different than what

00:03:36.648 --> 00:03:37.750
Obama was thinking.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.085
JOHN ROBERTS: --swear--

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:41.020
BARACK OBAMA: I, Barack Hussein
Obama, do solemnly swear--

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.422
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY: They were kind
of counterposing each other.

00:03:43.522 --> 00:03:45.457
And they would go
back and forth.

00:03:45.557 --> 00:03:47.160 line:7%
And it was an awkward moment.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.329 line:0%
JOHN ROBERTS: --the
United States faithfully--

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:51.497 line:0%
BARACK OBAMA: --and
I will execute--

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:53.098 line:0%
JOHN ROBERTS: --the--
faithfully the President--

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:54.533 line:0%
the Office of President
of the United States--

00:03:54.633 --> 00:03:55.167 line:0%
BARACK OBAMA: --the Office
of President of the United

00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:56.201 line:7%
States faithfully.

00:03:56.301 --> 00:03:57.269 line:0%
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY:
Immediately, people

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:58.804 line:7%
called it a botched oath.

00:03:58.904 --> 00:04:00.773
Some people even
questioned, is President

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:02.408
Obama a real president?

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:03.476 line:0%
JEFFREY TOOBIN:
The next morning,

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:05.043 line:0%
a new Justice
Department official

00:04:05.143 --> 00:04:08.648 line:0%
named David Barron called the
White House counsel and said,

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:13.753 line:0%
you know, we might want to
think about doing this again.

00:04:13.853 --> 00:04:18.224
And that's what set in motion
the redo later that day.

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:20.292
I would describe the
atmosphere in the White House

00:04:20.392 --> 00:04:21.627
as kind of sheepish.

00:04:21.727 --> 00:04:24.930
Everyone was kind of embarrassed
to have to do this again.

00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:27.833
- Four years later, he
took it two more times,

00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:31.637
but that's because in 2013,
January 20 landed on a Sunday.

00:04:31.737 --> 00:04:33.372
When that happens,
the president-elect

00:04:33.472 --> 00:04:35.708
takes the oath privately in the
White House and then publicly

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:36.976
the next day.

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:38.177 line:0%
SASHA OBAMA: Good job, Daddy.
BARACK OBAMA: I did it.

00:04:38.277 --> 00:04:39.245
SASHA OBAMA: You didn't mess up.

00:04:39.345 --> 00:04:40.479
- Yeah, Dad, good job.

00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:41.447
Can I call you Dad?

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:42.682
BARACK OBAMA: Thank
you, everybody.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:45.785
- In all, Obama has taken
the oath four times.

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:48.654
The only other president to
take the oath that many times is

00:04:48.754 --> 00:04:50.656
FDR, but that's
only because he was

00:04:50.756 --> 00:04:52.858
elected president four times.

00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.460
A little different.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.362
Of course, Obama isn't
the only president

00:04:56.462 --> 00:05:00.433
whose swearing-in ceremony
has been a little bit weird.

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:02.735
For example, it
didn't go so smoothly

00:05:02.835 --> 00:05:04.737
for President Truman in 1945.

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:07.606
- Vice President Harry S.
Truman take the oath of office

00:05:07.706 --> 00:05:09.308
as 32nd president.

00:05:09.408 --> 00:05:12.211
- There's no audio of it,
but when Harry S. Truman took

00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:15.081
the oath, Chief Justice
Harlan Stone said,

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:17.550
I, Harry Ship Truman.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.751
But Stone made that up.

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:20.386
Truman's middle name
was just the letter S.

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:21.721
WILLIAM HOWARD
TAFT: --faithfully

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:26.192
execute the Office of the
President of the United States.

00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:29.261
- It also wasn't perfect
for Herbert Hoover in 1929.

00:05:29.361 --> 00:05:31.196 line:0%
WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT: --to
the best of your ability

00:05:31.297 --> 00:05:35.601 line:0%
that you will preserve,
maintain, and defend.

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:37.636 line:0%
- It's subtle, but did
you pick up on that?

00:05:37.736 --> 00:05:41.240
Chief Justice William Howard
Taft said maintain instead of

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.608
protect the Constitution.

00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:43.910
WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT:
--the Constitution

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.678
of the United States.

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:48.881
- In 1909, when Taft
himself was sworn in,

00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:50.849
his oath was also misquoted.

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:52.618
JOHN ROBERTS: --and will,
to the best of my ability--

00:05:52.718 --> 00:05:54.386
BARACK OBAMA: --and will,
to the best of my ability--

00:05:54.486 --> 00:05:55.955
- While those earlier
administrations

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:57.857
played a little fast
and loose with the oath,

00:05:57.957 --> 00:06:02.261
Obama's camp felt differently,
because of, well, you know.

00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:03.495
(WHISPERING) I'm
not going to say it.

00:06:03.595 --> 00:06:04.697
JEFFREY TOOBIN:
Obama himself had

00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:07.232
nothing to do with the
decision to redo the oath.

00:06:07.332 --> 00:06:08.968
It was the people around him.

00:06:09.068 --> 00:06:12.905
His aides, who knew that
politically as much as legally,

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:16.041
it was very important to
establish his legitimacy.

00:06:16.141 --> 00:06:18.277
They knew he was the
first African-American.

00:06:18.377 --> 00:06:20.780
They knew these false
questions had been

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.048
raised about his birthplace.

00:06:23.148 --> 00:06:27.352
So they decided, let's
foreclose any controversy

00:06:27.452 --> 00:06:28.988
and redo the whole thing.

00:06:29.088 --> 00:06:30.957
- Maybe we should just go back
to the way they administered

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.592
the oath in the 1800s.

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:34.994 line:0%
BEN ZIMMER: Originally, whoever
was administering the oath

00:06:35.094 --> 00:06:36.262 line:7%
would ask it as a question.

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:38.698 line:0%
Do you, such and
such, solemnly swear?

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:42.235
And then the person would
respond just by saying, I do,

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:43.736
or I do solemnly swear.

00:06:43.836 --> 00:06:44.670
HERBERT HOOVER: I do.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:45.938
BEN ZIMMER: In
more modern times,

00:06:46.038 --> 00:06:49.375
the new president actually
repeats every single word.

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:51.343
- --that I will
faithfully execute--

00:06:51.443 --> 00:06:53.112
JIMMY CARTER: --that I
will faithfully execute--

00:06:53.212 --> 00:06:54.547
BEN ZIMMER: The
whole idea of taking

00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:58.817
an oath to assume a new office
goes back to ancient times.

00:06:58.917 --> 00:07:01.186
HARRY TRUMAN: I, Harry S.
Truman, do solemnly swear--

00:07:01.286 --> 00:07:02.654
- The presidential
oath is shorter

00:07:02.754 --> 00:07:04.590
than other official oath.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:05.524
It's shorter than--

00:07:05.624 --> 00:07:07.126
- --to have and to hold--

00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:07.993
- --most wedding vows--

00:07:08.093 --> 00:07:08.827
- --and in health--

00:07:08.927 --> 00:07:10.462
- --perform no operation for--

00:07:10.562 --> 00:07:12.798
- --shorter than the
Hippocratic Oath.

00:07:12.898 --> 00:07:15.167
- On my honor, I
will do my best--

00:07:15.267 --> 00:07:17.436
- Even the Boy Scouts
have a longer oath.

00:07:17.536 --> 00:07:18.937
The Boy Scouts.

00:07:19.037 --> 00:07:20.739
It takes more words
to promise to get

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:22.841
an old lady safely
across the street

00:07:22.941 --> 00:07:24.977
than it does to get
the nuclear codes.

00:07:25.077 --> 00:07:27.646
- --mentally awake
and morally straight.

00:07:27.746 --> 00:07:30.549
- But how much do Americans
know about the oath of office?

00:07:30.649 --> 00:07:32.785
We decided to test
a few to find out.

00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:35.153
And since we like our
tests with chicken wings,

00:07:35.254 --> 00:07:36.555
we headed to the
Founding Fathers

00:07:36.655 --> 00:07:38.457
bar in Buffalo, New York.

00:07:38.557 --> 00:07:40.058
- Welcome to Founding Fathers.

00:07:40.158 --> 00:07:42.695
We're going to be
taking the CNN Oath

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:45.264
of Office Trivia Challenge.

00:07:45.364 --> 00:07:46.431
Are we ready?

00:07:46.531 --> 00:07:47.366
- Not really.

00:07:47.466 --> 00:07:48.634
- All right.

00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:52.705 line:0%
Who was the only president
to take the oath of office

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:55.073 line:7%
from a female official?

00:07:55.173 --> 00:07:56.275 line:7%
- Uh, Bill Clinton?

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:57.777 line:7%
He was good with the ladies.

00:07:57.877 --> 00:07:58.877 line:7%
- LBJ.

00:07:58.977 --> 00:08:02.281 line:0%
It was federal judge
Sarah Hughes aboard Air

00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:03.882 line:7%
Force One in Dallas, Texas.

00:08:03.982 --> 00:08:04.683 line:7%
- Oh, my god.

00:08:04.783 --> 00:08:06.118 line:7%
I totally didn't know that.

00:08:06.218 --> 00:08:09.121 line:0%
- Which president
and what year was

00:08:09.221 --> 00:08:13.759 line:0%
the first oath of office to
take place in Washington, DC?

00:08:13.859 --> 00:08:14.694 line:7%
- 1492.

00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:15.861 line:7%
1776.

00:08:15.961 --> 00:08:16.929 line:7%
My mom's birthday.

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:18.130 line:7%
- Jefferson, right here.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.231 line:7%
1801.

00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:21.534 line:0%
- This guy's going
too fast, right?

00:08:21.634 --> 00:08:25.370 line:0%
- Who was the first
president to affirm rather

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.406 line:7%
than swear the oath of office?

00:08:27.506 --> 00:08:28.373 line:7%
- What's the difference?

00:08:28.473 --> 00:08:29.674 line:7%
Those are synonyms!

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:30.475 line:7%
- Pierce!

00:08:30.575 --> 00:08:31.277 line:7%
Franklin Pierce!

00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:32.577 line:7%
We have a winner!

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:33.378 line:7%
- Pierce?

00:08:33.478 --> 00:08:36.782 line:7%
That's a president?

00:08:36.882 --> 00:08:38.283
Here's another piece of trivia.

00:08:38.383 --> 00:08:40.752
When Donald Trump takes the
oath of office this year,

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:42.821
he'll be the first
president since Eisenhower

00:08:42.921 --> 00:08:47.025
to be sworn in without
any political experience.

00:08:47.125 --> 00:08:50.830
What won't be different
is all the fanfare,

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:55.734
including "The President's
Own" United States Marine Band.

00:08:55.834 --> 00:08:57.569
[music playing]

00:08:57.669 --> 00:08:59.771
Hey, how can I
get a Marine band?

00:08:59.871 --> 00:09:01.040 line:0%
JASON K. FETTIG: We
think we've played

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.841 line:0%
for every presidential
inauguration

00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:06.278 line:0%
since 1801, since
Thomas Jefferson.

00:09:06.378 --> 00:09:09.447
Music is actually central
to the inaugural ceremony.

00:09:09.548 --> 00:09:10.949
It really is the
thing that glues

00:09:11.049 --> 00:09:12.718
the entire ceremony together.

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:15.654
And when we come to the part
of the presidential oath,

00:09:15.754 --> 00:09:17.556
the music really is the
thing that, I think,

00:09:17.656 --> 00:09:20.325
seals the deal for the new
President of the United States.

00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:25.397
- [humming] I feel more
presidential right now.

00:09:25.497 --> 00:09:26.999
JASON K. FETTIG: Immediately
following the oath,

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:28.868
we play "Four Ruffles
and Flourishes."

00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:32.805
[MUSIC - "FOUR RUFFLES AND
 FLOURISHES"]

00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:39.778
And then we play
"Hail to the Chief,"

00:09:39.878 --> 00:09:42.581
which is official honors for the
President of the United States.

00:09:42.681 --> 00:09:46.218
[music - "hail to the chief"]

00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:51.724
- These guys are good.

00:09:51.824 --> 00:09:54.326
JASON K. FETTIG: And this is
the first time the new president

00:09:54.426 --> 00:09:55.894
hears "Hail to the Chief."

00:09:55.994 --> 00:09:59.999
[music - "hail to the chief"]

00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:02.668
When we have an inauguration
where the new president

00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:04.303
is not the incumbent,
we actually

00:10:04.403 --> 00:10:07.506
play "Hail to the Chief" twice.

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:09.041
We will play "Hail to
the Chief" for President

00:10:09.141 --> 00:10:11.777
Obama for the very last
time in his administration.

00:10:11.877 --> 00:10:13.779 line:0%
And then when President
Trump is sworn in,

00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:16.015 line:0%
we will play "Hail to the
Chief" for the very first

00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:19.818 line:7%
time for the new president.

00:10:19.918 --> 00:10:22.688 line:0%
The oath and the music
brings the entire ceremony

00:10:22.788 --> 00:10:24.089 line:7%
to its zenith.

00:10:24.189 --> 00:10:26.425
[music playing]

00:10:26.525 --> 00:10:29.962
- Sure, it may seem like a
lot of pomp and circumstance,

00:10:30.062 --> 00:10:30.796
but in the end.

00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:33.598
It is so much bigger than that.

00:10:33.698 --> 00:10:35.468
Because even when
all the fanfare

00:10:35.568 --> 00:10:38.904
is stripped away,
even in a simple home

00:10:39.004 --> 00:10:40.272
like Chester Arthur--

00:10:40.372 --> 00:10:42.307
LYNDON JOHNSON: --will to
the best of my ability--

00:10:42.407 --> 00:10:45.845
- --on-board a plane in a time
of crisis like Lyndon Johnson,

00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:47.846
even behind closed
doors at the White House

00:10:47.946 --> 00:10:49.081
to make up for a mistake--

00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:50.483
BARACK OBAMA: --I will
to the best of my--

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:53.785
- --it really is
all about the oath.

00:10:53.885 --> 00:10:57.923
35 words with the power
to make a president,

00:10:58.023 --> 00:11:01.727
and hopefully,
unite the country.
