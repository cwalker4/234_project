&gt;&gt; Tucker: JESSICA, THANK YOU.

00:00:06.303 --> 00:00:09.973

00:00:11.908 --> 00:00:15.078
COMING ON.

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:17.314
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE FOR

00:00:15.212 --> 00:00:19.349
MORE IMMIGRATION INTO THE

00:00:17.447 --> 00:00:21.118
COUNTRY, BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU

00:00:19.483 --> 00:00:22.786
SUPPORT PEOPLE WALKING ACROSS

00:00:21.251 --> 00:00:25.589
MEXICO AND JUST SHOWING UP AND

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:28.558
EXPECTING TO BE LET IN.

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:31.461
AND IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN WE

00:00:28.692 --> 00:00:34.698
WOULD NO LONGER BE A COUNTRY.

00:00:31.595 --> 00:00:35.666
&gt;&gt; MEXICO IS NOT A HOSTILE

00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:36.800
NATION.

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:40.370
&gt;&gt; Tucker: OF COURSE IT IS.

00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:43.974
&gt;&gt; NO, IT IS NOT.

00:00:40.504 --> 00:00:44.908
IT IS PEOPLE COMING ON IN

00:00:44.107 --> 00:00:48.178
CENTRAL AMERICA.

00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:48.612
THIS IS HAPPENED SINCE REAGAN

00:00:48.311 --> 00:00:50.047
INTERFERED.

00:00:48.745 --> 00:00:51.481
THEY ARE ESCAPING VIOLENCE AND

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.718
HUNGER AND LOOKING FOR REFUGE

00:00:51.615 --> 00:00:57.087
AND TRYING TO COME TO THE

00:00:54.851 --> 00:00:59.189
COUNTRY AND YOU HAVE A BOERPD

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.024
PATROL SPOKESMAN AND SAID COME

00:00:59.322 --> 00:01:01.625
AND YOU WILL GET IN, THAT'S

00:01:01.158 --> 00:01:03.727
A LIE.

00:01:01.758 --> 00:01:06.029
THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT WORK AND

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.631
IT CAUSES THESE PEOPLE TO CROSS

00:01:06.163 --> 00:01:09.533
AND THINK THEY WILL GET.

00:01:07.764 --> 00:01:12.335
MOST WILL NOT GET IN.

00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:16.339
&gt;&gt; Tucker: I AM NOT SURE WHY YOU

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:19.242
WOULD FEEL AN OBLIGATION TO

00:01:16.473 --> 00:01:21.011
DEFEND THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO

00:01:19.376 --> 00:01:22.846
WHICH HIS BEEN LITERALLY FOR

00:01:21.144 --> 00:01:24.414
YEARS AND TRAINED PEOPLE WITH

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.550
DOCUMENTS THAT WE HAVE ON HOW TO

00:01:24.548 --> 00:01:29.453
GET IN THIS COUNTRY ILLEGALLY.

00:01:26.683 --> 00:01:31.021
WHY ARE YOU FLACKING FOR THEM?

00:01:29.586 --> 00:01:31.321
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS IN IT FOR

00:01:31.154 --> 00:01:33.190
YOU.

00:01:31.455 --> 00:01:34.691
STOP LYING ABOUT THIS.

00:01:33.323 --> 00:01:34.991
MIXTURE CO COULD STOP IT RIGHT

00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:36.393
NOW.

00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:38.061
IT IS IT A LONG COUNTRY.

00:01:36.526 --> 00:01:40.831
AND THEY ARE NOT.

00:01:38.195 --> 00:01:43.600
THIS IS AN ACT OF HOSTILITY.

00:01:40.964 --> 00:01:45.535
&gt;&gt; THE THING IS WE ALLOW PEOPLE

00:01:43.734 --> 00:01:47.370
TO TRAVEL FREELY IN THE COUNTRY

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:49.673
AS A LOT OF COUNTRIES DO.

00:01:47.504 --> 00:01:51.808
YOU ARE LYING.

00:01:49.806 --> 00:01:54.111
SHOW ME A DOCUMENT WHERE THE

00:01:51.942 --> 00:01:55.746
MEXICAN GOVERNMENT IS TRAINING

00:01:54.244 --> 00:01:56.113
PEOPLE TO CROSS INTO THE UNITED

00:01:55.879 --> 00:02:00.016
STATES.

00:01:56.246 --> 00:02:00.484
THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT IS NOT

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.184
DOING.

00:02:00.617 --> 00:02:04.721

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.795
&gt;&gt; SUPERIOR ARROGANCE.

00:02:09.693 --> 00:02:14.564
&gt;&gt; I KNOW YOU ARE SAN DIEGO AND

00:02:11.928 --> 00:02:16.166
YOUR RACISM IS WELL KNOWN.

00:02:14.698 --> 00:02:18.602
&gt;&gt; Tucker: THE MEXICAN

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.603
GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN

00:02:18.735 --> 00:02:22.005
INSTRUCTIONS TO PEOPLE, I'VE

00:02:19.736 --> 00:02:25.208
SEEN IT WITH MY OWN EYES ON HOW

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:27.744
TO GET ACROSS THE BORDER.

00:02:25.342 --> 00:02:29.846
BULLPEN THE HOLD ON, THIS GROUP

00:02:27.878 --> 00:02:31.681
MUCH PEOPLE COULD BE STOPPED ANY

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.719
TIME BY THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT

00:02:31.815 --> 00:02:36.553
WHICH YOU FEEL A NEED TO MAKE

00:02:35.852 --> 00:02:38.355
APOLOGIES ARE.

00:02:36.686 --> 00:02:40.857
THEY KETAIN PEOPLE.

00:02:38.488 --> 00:02:42.626
BUT THEY ARE NOT BECAUSE THEY

00:02:40.991 --> 00:02:44.661
ARE GOING EL NORTE.

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:46.296
AND THEY ARE A HOSTILE POWER.

00:02:44.795 --> 00:02:47.964
&gt;&gt; MOVEMENT PEOPLE ARE NOT

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:50.000
COMING TO THE UNITED STATES.

00:02:48.098 --> 00:02:52.536
MOST PEOPLE GO ELSEWHERE AND NO

00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:54.137
DESIRE TO COME HERE.

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:55.939
250 MILLION PEOPLE.

00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:58.141
UNITED STATES HAS 11 MILLION AND

00:02:56.072 --> 00:02:59.643
THAT FLOW HAS SHIFTED AND

00:02:58.275 --> 00:03:02.012
DROPPED 40 PERCENT.

00:02:59.776 --> 00:03:04.181
&gt;&gt; Tucker: YOU ARE MISSING IT.

00:03:02.145 --> 00:03:05.282
WHY SHOULD WE TAKE ANY THAT COME

00:03:04.314 --> 00:03:07.150
HERE ILLEGALLY.

00:03:05.415 --> 00:03:08.385
&gt;&gt; THERE IS NO WAY FOR THEM TO

00:03:07.284 --> 00:03:12.322
COME HERE LEGALLY.

00:03:08.518 --> 00:03:13.990
AND THE DEMAND FOR THE DRUGS AND

00:03:12.455 --> 00:03:15.559
INVADING IRAQ OR INTERFERE

00:03:14.124 --> 00:03:18.195
NOTHING CIVIL WARS.

00:03:15.692 --> 00:03:21.031
THAT CAUSES PEOPLE TO FLEE.

00:03:18.328 --> 00:03:22.232
&gt;&gt; Tucker: SO OUR SINS ARE THE

00:03:21.164 --> 00:03:23.433
REASONS AND SO YOU HATE AMERICA

00:03:22.365 --> 00:03:26.403
IS WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.

00:03:23.567 --> 00:03:28.605
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, IT IS

00:03:26.536 --> 00:03:32.242
INTERESTING, YOU ARE BLAMING

00:03:28.738 --> 00:03:33.410

00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:35.879
INTO AMERICA.

00:03:33.543 --> 00:03:37.180
&gt;&gt; CENTRAL AMERICA IS MEXICO IS

00:03:36.012 --> 00:03:38.415
PART OF AMERICA.

00:03:37.314 --> 00:03:41.751
&gt;&gt; Tucker: IT IS A SEPARATE

00:03:38.548 --> 00:03:42.152
COUNTRY AND NOT THE SAME AS

00:03:41.885 --> 00:03:44.588

00:03:49.626 --> 00:03:54.331
OUR SINS IN ELSAL VADOR.

00:03:52.295 --> 00:03:56.166
