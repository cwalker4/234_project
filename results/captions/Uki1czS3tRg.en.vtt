Do you have any time off?

00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:07.140
-Yeah, you know, I feel like you
make the time off.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.442 align:start size:94% position:6%
Like, we've had to
readjust our lives now

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.778 align:start size:94% position:6%

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:14.080 align:start size:94% position:6%
So we just go, like -- we know
it's, like, morning wake --

like, you don't have
a cock crowing.

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:17.150 align:start size:94% position:6%

That's how we wake up.

We go, what's gonna happen,
what's gonna happen,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.255
what's gonna happen, what's
gonna happen, and then we chill.

-But do you ever get
any vacation or anything?

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:26.893

-You should go.
Like, Bali was phenomenal.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.202 align:start size:94% position:6%
A lot of people suggested it.
I will say this, though.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:38.905 align:start size:94% position:6%

specifically for
people of color.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.610
No, 'cause white people like
different things on vacations

than everybody else, right?
[ Laughter ]

Like -- no,
'cause white people --

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:48.882 align:start size:94% position:6%
like white people always
give you suggestions

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:52.252
of things that you wouldn't want
to do as a person of color.

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:55.288 align:start size:94% position:6%

Like -- like adventure sports,

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:56.122 line:92%
is, like, a very white thing.

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:57.424
Like, they'd be like, "I want to
be like, bungee jumping.

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:59.559
I want to do something -- I want
to feel like life is dangerous."

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.761 align:start size:94% position:6%
And as a black person,
you're like, "That's life."

[ Laughter ]

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:05.231 size:78% position:39%
So I don't want to go
and do those things.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:05.899 size:88% position:44% line:92%
Do you know what I mean?

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.168
Getting pulled over by the cops
is bungee jumping.

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:09.002 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'm fine.
[ Laughter ]

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.137 align:start size:94% position:6%
I just want to relax
when I go on a vacation.

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:12.105 align:start size:94% position:6%
-You live that.
-People are like,

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:14.841
"You don't want to go camping?"
That was my life growing up.

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:16.509 align:start size:94% position:6%
No running water,
no food when I --

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.845
no, I don't want to go camping.
[ Laughter ]

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:20.113 line:92%
I don't want to go back home.

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:21.815 align:start size:94% position:6%
That's like --
I've worked hard now.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:22.649 size:84% position:42% line:92%
I want to enjoy myself.

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:23.683 align:start size:94% position:6%
So, like, Bali --
that was the trick.

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:25.385 align:start size:94% position:6%
People would be like, "Trevor,
you got to go to Bali."

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:26.653 align:start size:94% position:6%
I was like,
"What's gonna happen in Bali?"

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:28.588 align:start size:94% position:6%
"Like, it's so unique."
[ Laughter ]

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:31.024 align:start size:94% position:6%
And now I've learned,
when white people say unique,

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:31.624 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
they mean poor.

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:33.093 align:start size:94% position:6%
But they don't tell you that.
-No.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.661 size:75% position:38%
-Right, like it's --
so I went to Bali.

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.162 align:start size:94% position:6%
And I was like, "Oh, this is
gonna be amazing."

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:37.163 align:start size:94% position:6%
And it is.
Like, there's temples,

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:38.364 align:start size:94% position:6%
there's culture,
the food is amazing.

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:40.300 align:start size:94% position:6%
The people are the friendliest
you'll ever meet.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.802 align:start size:94% position:6%
But like, what I didn't know
was, like,

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:44.771 align:start size:94% position:6%
half of the trip
was just gonna be us

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:47.273 size:84% position:42%
seeing people who don't
have the best means.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.375 align:start size:94% position:6%
So, like, we go into, like,
a person's house --

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:50.710 align:start size:94% position:6%
and I thought
it was like a temple.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.178 size:78% position:39%
And then we talk in,
and it's just like --

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:54.514 align:start size:94% position:6%
like someone's --
but "house" is a strong word.

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:55.582 size:84% position:42% line:92%
It's like a one room --

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:57.183 align:start size:94% position:6%
like it's a kitchen, bedroom,
dining room.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.385 align:start size:94% position:6%
Like a New York apartment-type
