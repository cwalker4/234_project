00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.700
In July 1983, Air Canada flight 143 ran out
of fuel and had to make an emergency landing.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.600
In September 1999, NASA lost contact with the Mars Climate Orbiter, its $200 million

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.260
spacecraft, after it crashed into Mars.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.100
And in December 2003, a rollercoaster in Tokyo Disneyland derailed.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.160
They all happened because of mix-ups between the metric and imperial systems.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.460
Not pumping enough fuel, calculating incorrect trajectories,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.420
and using an axle that was too small.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.760
Pretty much every country in the world uses the metric system for measurement.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.520
Having a universal system would be like having a common language across the world,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.560
making it easier to communicate, trade and invest.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.060
Well technically, it already has.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.700
Yes, since all the way back in 1875 — and
several times since — the United States

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.890
has committed to the metric system.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.650
All its units have been defined in terms of
metric standards since the late 1800s, and

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.309
it’s officially the “preferred system
of weights and measures for United States

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.320
trade and commerce”.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.920
Well, to understand that, we need to look back at how the metric system came to be.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.260
For hundreds and thousands of years, humans used a variety of number and measurement systems.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.920
Within the same country, you’d encounter
different units while moving from town to town.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.560
This obviously made things like trading a
lot more complicated.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.720
Fast forward to the French revolution.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.420
At this point in time, France had tens of
thousands of different standards.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.380
The revolutionaries wanted, among other things, a radical new measurement system that would

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.120
be simple and universal.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.300
People had already been developing a decimal system of measurement for some time, but the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.420
revolution sort of sped things up.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.500
The French turned to the constants of nature.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.539
For example, the first definition of the metre was based on the distance between the equator

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.040
and the North Pole.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.040
Other units in the new system were based upon the metre — one litre was defined as the

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.700
volume of a cubic decimetre.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.380
And the system as a whole was decimal-based, to make conversions easier.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.900
Like any widespread change, people didn’t
take to it straight away.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.500
They even abandoned it for a while before
returning to it in 1840.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.760
But the system soon became so useful that many other countries began adopting it.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.060
A few decades later, an international agreement was formed to refine the accuracy of the standards.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.690
17 countries signed the agreement, including the United States of America.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.790
They declared the metre as the length of this metal pole, and the kilogram as the mass of

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.900
this metal cylinder.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.780
85 years later, the metric system was updated again to bring it into modern times.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.240
Known as the SI system, it established 7 base units.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.920
This is the metric system as we know it today.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.860
And in case you’re wondering, the metre
is now defined once again by nature.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.940
Anyway, getting back to the point, the US
has signed several documents over several

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.270
decades, committing to the metric system.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.580
So why is it still using the imperial system
today?

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.560
The US Customary System, as it’s officially called, is not the easiest system to learn

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.180
— there’s no direct correlation between different units.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.660
Instead of a decimal-based system, where units can be converted fairly simply,

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.880
there are several different conversions to remember.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.400
But what’s interesting is these imperial
units are already all defined in relation

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.700
to SI units.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:30.040
Since 1959, the pound has officially been
exactly 0.45359237 kilograms,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.360
and a yard 0.9144 metres.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.520
Which means even though everything you buy in the US is usually in customary units,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.380
you can trace it all back to the metric system.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.420
Also, the names for various imperial units are sometimes the same, which can be a bit confusing.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.800
Do you think of the short ton, which is 2,000lb?

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.420
Or maybe the long ton, which is 2,240lb?

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.780
If that’s not confusing enough, these are
just two of the several “tons” out there.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.580
And if you’re sitting there thinking a tonne
is 1,000kg, that’s the metric tonne, with

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.830
an extra “ne”.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.860
The US has tried to switch to metric, though.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:05.640
Several times.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.100
Even though it was authorised for use way back in 1866, the strongest push for metrication

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.050
came more than 100 years later.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.320
In 1975, Congress passed the Metric Conversion Act, and established the US Metric Board.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.200
The board wasn’t given much power though.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.760
It got as far as interstate 19 in Arizona,
the only US highway to have metric road signs.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.600
The board was then dissolved in 1982.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.580
But then a few years later, the Act was amended to declare metric as "the preferred system”

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.880
in the United States.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.100
Since 1994, both metric and US customary units have been required on commercial packaging.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.460
And the metric system is now the standard in a lot of industries, with construction

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.960
being one of the exceptions.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.980
But the reason it’s still not used in day-to-day life is because, while the Act has been amended

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.560
over the years, one key part hasn’t changed — the fact that conversion is still voluntary.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.540
Other countries which have converted from imperial to metric, especially in the last

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.280
50 years or so, have successfully done so
because it was compulsory.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.940
In Australia, conversion to the metric system began in 1970 with some industries converting

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.240
first before others.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.720
By the end of 1976, most industries and all packaged goods had been converted to metric.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.830
Even the birthplace of the imperial system, England, began transitioning to the metric

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.630
system in 1965, to integrate more closely
with continental Europe.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.340
For them, it was a long and slow process.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.350
There are still systematic hangovers from
the imperial system, but in schools, the metric

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.400
system is taught.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.660
These examples highlight the main reason most countries have converted, even when (not if)

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.620
faced with resistance — it’s to keep up
with the global economy.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.150
In the US today, only Federal agencies are
required to use the metric system for business,

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.150
where practical.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.630
While the US remains imperial, many private businesses are having to produce for both

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.580
the US and overseas markets.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.340
Liberia and Myanmar are the only two other countries which haven’t officially made the switch.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.720
But in practice, the two countries do use
several aspects of the metric system in daily life.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.080
It will take some time to switch over, and
cost a lot initially.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.900
But the cost of metrication is one-off, compared to the ongoing costs of servicing two markets.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.940
So while the rest of the world continues to operate in a metric system, it seems like only a matter

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.130
of time before the US switches over.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.699
Four of the 7 base SI units — including

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:23.070
the kilogram — are actually currently in
the process of being redefined.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.020
The definitions will return to fundamental
constants of nature.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.850
So no more metal cylinder.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.900
So what changes will this have for you?

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:31.900
Not much.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.380
Current definitions are fine for day-to-day
use, but they’re just not up to scratch

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.860
for modern scientific testing.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.800
So when the process is all done, you shouldn’t notice a difference.
