00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.610
-Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.970
that the Senate proceed
to the immediate consideration

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.260
of calendar number five --
HR 21 --

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.410
Making appropriations
for the fiscal year

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.220
ending September 30, 2019.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.200
I further ask that the bill
be considered read a third time

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.380
and passed in a motion
to be considered made

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.950
and laid upon the table with no
intervening action or debate.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.860
-The president opposes
piecemeal appropriations

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.020
that neglect border security
and would veto them.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.250
So obviously, that isn't
gonna be come law.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.620
So this proposal flunks
the Democratic leaders

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.890
on test of a few days ago.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.810
So, look, the political stunts
are not gonna get us anywhere.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.240
Senate Democrats should stop
blocking the Senate

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.810
from taking up
other urgent matters,

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.990
like the pending bills
concerning Israel

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.060
and the Syrian civil war.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.420
In previous
government shutdowns,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.220
the Senate's done business.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.760
The Senate hasn't been
shut down.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.130
So that's what we ought
to be doing.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.810
And actually, at the same time,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.170
negotiate with the president
on border security

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.260
because nothing else
is gonna get a solution.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.560
Therefore I object.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.630
-We passed the bill
that I asked unanimous consent.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.670
Basically, that's been passed
near-unanimously by this body --

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.850
92-6 for these
appropriations passed.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.370
The last time I checked
the Constitution,

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.670
that's enough even
for a veto override.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.200
I don't think
anything has changed.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.810
These bills have
nothing to do --

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.690
zero to do with
Homeland Security wall issue.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.930
Zero!

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.590
So why doesn't our distinguished
majority leader,

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.770
as the leader of a co-equal
branch of government,

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.000
allow us to speak on behalf
of our responsibilities

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.310
under Article
I of the Constitution?

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.870
Let us take our action
that we can take right now,

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.830
today, at this very moment
and pass six appropriation bills

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.560
where there's no controversy
whatsoever in this body.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.250
-As I've said, Madam President,
repeatedly,

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.050
it won't solve the problem

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.300
because the president's made it
clear he won't sign them.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.090
-I would just say three words to
my friend the majority leader.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.850
Open the government.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.730
It's in your hands.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.430
I yield the floor.
