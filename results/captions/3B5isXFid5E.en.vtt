00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.933
- We have to figure out where
it is exactly ourselves.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.000
Good morning, I hope you're
having an amazing day.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.833
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:09.140
I'm in Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.630
in the mountains, and
starting this morning

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.630
from a very strategic, a very
important place in the world.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.940
The plan for today is
we're driving from Gilgit

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.510
to Hunza Valley, and Hunza Valley is known

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.300
for being one of the most
spectacularly beautiful

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.460
places in Pakistan,
and maybe in the world.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.170
And the food people eat,
people are known to have

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.620
a very, very long life, some
of the longest lifespans

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.780
in the world because the food is so good.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.730
The food is so fresh, and the air

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.470
and water quality is so good,

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.380
and definitely tonight for
dinner is gonna be a highlight

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.050
because we've been invited to a local home

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.196
to experience the longevity
food of Hunza Valley.

00:00:49.196 --> 00:00:52.613
(upbeat Pakistani music)

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.820
This is the merger of three of the world's

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.510
highest mountain chains,
so let me stand up,

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.340
let me see if I can get this right.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.520
But directly behind me right here

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.620
that's where the Himalayas,
I guess, the Himalayas begin.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.970
That's where they collided.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.370
So, the Himalayas are there.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.545
If you look behind me,
what's up Ali and Gill?

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:16.560
- Hey, we're good.
(laughing)

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.560
- This is the Hindu Kush mountain range,

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.240
and then if you look over on this side

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.100
where you have these jagged rock peaks,

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.890
that's the Karakoram mountain range,

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.490
and then the river is the confluence

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.890
between the Gilgit and the Indus rivers.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.760
That is the actual point where all three

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.780
of the mountain chains collide.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.860
This is just a quiet, peaceful,

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.790
all you can hear literally
is the rivers flowing.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.720
(footsteps crunching)

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.330
Just for a little more context,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.960
the Himalayas are of course home to

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.530
the highest mountain in
the world, Mount Everest.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.600
The Karakorum mountain range
is home to K2, but sometimes

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.050
they're referred to kind of as
the same, but, geologically,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.410
the Karakorams are a
total different range,

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.790
and then the Hindu Kush is actually

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.186
right behind me right now.

00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:05.936
(inspiring electronic music)

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.951
And then back at the hotel for breakfast.

00:02:08.951 --> 00:02:12.701
(inspiring electronic music)

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.040
Nothing like curry for
breakfast in the morning.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.350
This one is called chicken Achari.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.230
It has like a mustardy taste to it.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.980
Some keema, some minced meat curry.

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:27.865
(sipping)

00:02:27.865 --> 00:02:29.610
Okay, and that completes breakfast.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.450
We've gotta pack up our
bags and we are moving.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.857
We're on our way to Hunza.

00:02:32.857 --> 00:02:37.095
(fluid instrumental music)

00:02:37.095 --> 00:02:38.610
Thank you to Gilgit Serena Hotel

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.560
for hosting us, for sponsoring our stay.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.420
We had a wonderful stay but we
are on our way now to Hunza,

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.230
Hunza Valley, and even the drive

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.460
is going to be spectacular,

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.040
and we're gonna stop for a viewpoint.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.685
Hopefully we have some
clear weather today.

00:02:49.685 --> 00:02:51.566
(horn blaring)

00:02:51.566 --> 00:02:55.233
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.263
It's just unbelievable,
spectacular scenery.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.463
Just taking a little stretch
but, oh man, the scenery.

00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:22.130
There's water just
gushing from the mountain.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.106
Just majestic.

00:03:23.106 --> 00:03:25.773
(water rushing)

00:03:28.586 --> 00:03:30.836
(laughing)

00:03:31.767 --> 00:03:33.664
Oh, it's so fresh.

00:03:33.664 --> 00:03:35.601
Oh, it's so tasty.

00:03:35.601 --> 00:03:37.029
That's such pure water.

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:39.188
(water rushing)

00:03:39.188 --> 00:03:42.438
- Wow. That is cold, and awesome. Wow.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.143
- I got a little water up the
nose but that was so worth it.

00:03:45.547 --> 00:03:48.403
(water rushing)

00:03:48.403 --> 00:03:52.070
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:03:56.852 --> 00:04:00.602
(speaking foreign language)

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.520
Welcome to Chapshoro Point, and Chapshoro,

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.450
it's like a stuffed pocket of dough,

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.960
kind of like a pastry
but filled with beef.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.260
This version is filled with beef.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.260
He has this huge,
rounded, concave hotplate,

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.670
and then if you come over on this side,

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.680
he has the wood fire burning

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.490
which is heating that entire iron plate.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.400
He's rolling out the dough,

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.943
and he's gonna make one
fresh for us right now.

00:04:29.915 --> 00:04:33.665
(speaking foreign language)

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:42.145
(upbeat Pakistani music)

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.122
And then that goes
directly into the hotplate

00:04:51.122 --> 00:04:52.988
which is fed by the fire.

00:04:52.988 --> 00:04:56.405
(upbeat Pakistani music)

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.400
- He's saying that you
have to open it from here

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.233
and then you eat it.

00:05:04.233 --> 00:05:05.750
- [Mark] Oh, so you kind of
drink the soup at the same time.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.310
- Exactly, so you don't
take the entire bite

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.829
because then it will spill over.

00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:09.662
- Okay.

00:05:09.662 --> 00:05:11.070
When I was talking to them making it,

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.590
they said it was beef
but actually it's yak.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.500
Kinda open up the pocket like this.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.960
Oh and hey, you just kinda
like lift up the lid.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.870
Immediately you can smell that aroma,

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.880
the onions in there, the juices,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.930
and you can really smell
that meatiness to it.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:27.790
Oh, that looks great.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.123
You can kind of peel off a piece, I think.

00:05:31.315 --> 00:05:33.370
Okay, I'm gonna take a
little bit of that lid,

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.260
grab some of that yak.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.610
Oh, look how juicy that is.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.563
Oh, that's fantastic.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.470
The meat mixture, the
yak mixture, is awesome.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.150
You get the crunchy onions.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.580
You've got like the brothy juices.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.570
There's definitely some chili
in there, some powdered chili.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.403
Look at Ying.

00:05:54.403 --> 00:05:56.239
Ying got another method of eating it.

00:05:56.239 --> 00:05:57.600
(laughing)

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.374
Ying, how is the yak?

00:05:59.374 --> 00:06:00.330
- Very good.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.163
- Like a pocket.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.070
And the bread, because
he kind of fire-roasts

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.060
the bread at the same time,

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.530
he put them in the fire for a little bit,

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.190
and then on to the hotplate.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.430
Kind of slow cooks, so it's
like the bread is gummy,

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.260
but at the same time, it's
kind of crispy on the edges,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.720
and it has that fire-roasted flavor to it.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.600
- What a cool dish.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.670
- Yak meat for the first time in my life.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:21.940
- [Mark] Oh, that's yak
meat for the first time?

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:22.860
- Yeah.
- [Mark] Nice.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.210
Follow that with some chai,

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.783
or, rather, this might be doodh patti.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.253
The perfect accompaniment beverage.

00:06:34.456 --> 00:06:35.544
- Mm.

00:06:35.544 --> 00:06:37.598
(laughing)

00:06:37.598 --> 00:06:38.431
(clapping)

00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:40.960
(upbeat Pakistani music)

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.010
- One more cup of doodh patti as we

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.593
lounge back in these chairs.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.220
Yeah, you can taste the creaminess,

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.878
and they're also using yak milk.

00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:55.295
(upbeat Pakistani music)

00:06:58.109 --> 00:07:01.650
Still have the taste of Rakaposhi.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.390
We made it to the Rakaposhi viewpoint

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.540
which is one of the highest
mountains in this region,

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.550
7,708 meters

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.860
25 thousand and 25 feet.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.920
It's massive, and it's fully clouded over.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.600
You can't see the top of the summit,

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.600
but you can see the base.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.173
You can see where the snow
and the glaciers start.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.790
Even without being able to
see it, it just has this aura.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:30.790
It has this sensation, I
mean, grand-esque monstrosity.

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:34.766
(upbeat Pakistani music)

00:07:47.502 --> 00:07:48.553
- Hello.
- [Driver] Hello.

00:07:48.553 --> 00:07:50.534
- Good morning.
- [Mark] Good morning.

00:07:50.534 --> 00:07:51.367
(speaking foreign language)

00:07:51.367 --> 00:07:52.300
- Thank you very much.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.220
Welcome to the Hunza Valley,

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.420
and we drove all the way to Karimabad,

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.380
which is one of the main villages,

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.253
main towns in the valley.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.833
It's like unimaginable beauty.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.960
You cannot even, it's almost too much

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.410
for your eyes to even see.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:17.160
Just no man could even create
something of this spectacle.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:17.993
- Welcome, Sir.

00:08:17.993 --> 00:08:18.863
- Thank you very much.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.440
The smoke is a traditional greeting.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.340
Very aromatic, you can smell a lot of,

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.020
like, it looks like a
mixture of pine, and needles,

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.513
and herbs that are ...

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.680
It's warming and smells great.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.630
- Welcome, Sir.
- Thank you very much.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:36.930
- Welcome, Sir.

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:38.070
- Thank you.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.910
Oh, and we've got some
of the bread and butter.

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:43.180
- Bread and butter, Sir.
- Oh, nice.

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.170
Grab a little piece of that.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.240
Get the full piece of butter?

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.073
- [Man] Yes.

00:08:47.073 --> 00:08:48.390
- A little chunk of butter there.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.800
Oh yeah, wow.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.770
That's rich.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:55.710
- Fresh apple juice, Sir?

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:56.810
- Thank you very much.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.910
I can say, without a
doubt, this is the best cup

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.970
of apple juice in the
most beautiful location

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.070
that I've ever had apple juice in my life.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:10.913
There's Micah.

00:09:10.913 --> 00:09:12.973
(laughing)

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.460
Welcome to our room.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.620
Yeah, we're gonna need
some thick blankets here,

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.163
thick, purple blankets.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.420
Literally, that same exact
view is right outside

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.070
on the balcony, on the patio.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:28.610
We're walking up to the Baltit Fort,

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.920
which is one of the
landmarks of Hunza Valley.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:35.920
It sits on top of another
little hill, just in the shadows

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.840
of the mountain, and it's spectacular.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.880
But we're just gonna hike up
just to get a viewpoint of it.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.200
Yeah, we are definitely not at sea level.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.640
Oh, you can feel your heart working.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.460
Air is thin.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.063
We're getting to the fort up here.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.493
Come on Micah, we're gonna make it.

00:09:53.493 --> 00:09:56.350
Man, we're like in the
cradle of the mountain.

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:59.930
This is a 700-year, and
something, old fort,

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.460
but it is all made of stone,

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.940
and then you just see the wood balconies,

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:08.170
and then you have this
unbelievable view again.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.480
- Just beyond adjectives.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.780
- Gill hasn't even spoken.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.932
- It's beyond words, man.

00:10:16.932 --> 00:10:20.515
(rhythmic Pakistani music)

00:10:29.901 --> 00:10:33.370
(thumping on cooking board)

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.700
(speaking foreign language)

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.720
- Hunza Food Pavilion,
have a heavenly experience.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.180
This is just a cool, little food hut

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.570
that we have stopped in.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:44.780
It's just a nice looking spot,

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.310
so we're just inquiring
about some snacks here.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:48.213
What is this?

00:10:48.213 --> 00:10:50.470
- This is Chapshoro mixture.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:52.085
- [Mark] Oh, that goes inside of the-

00:10:52.085 --> 00:10:52.918
- Yeah, chicken.

00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:53.751
- [Mark] That goes inside of the Chap-

00:10:53.751 --> 00:10:57.251
- Chicken, coriander, mint, ginger, onion.

00:11:00.492 --> 00:11:04.159
(speaking foreign language)

00:11:12.009 --> 00:11:13.844
- Oh, wow, so that's apricot oil?

00:11:13.844 --> 00:11:14.780
- [Woman] Oil, yeah.
- [Mark] Apricot oil.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.190
- Oil, yeah.

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:18.960
- But right now, she's
making a Chapshoro fresh,

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.370
but this is totally different version

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:21.203
from what we had earlier.

00:11:21.203 --> 00:11:24.530
This is made with chicken, and
you can see the spices in it,

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:28.758
and she actually fries
hers in apricot oils.

00:11:28.758 --> 00:11:30.590
(mellow music)

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.200
That was actually the inside mixture.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.720
We've all taken a seat here.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.050
It's just such a cozy, little mountain-

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.140
- It's like a miniature chalet.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.059
- [Mark] Yeah.
(laughing)

00:11:42.059 --> 00:11:44.642
(mellow music)

00:11:46.424 --> 00:11:47.507
- Chapshoro, cheers.

00:11:47.507 --> 00:11:48.453
Chapshoro, boys.

00:11:52.422 --> 00:11:53.255
- Awe.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:01.560
It's like curried chicken
inside of like doughy,

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.800
fragrant, like, it has a
chapati kind of feel to it,

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.590
but then it's so fragrant
because of that oil.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:09.047
- [Gill] Whoa, this is great, yeah.

00:12:09.047 --> 00:12:11.090
- [Ali] The chicken is
beating the yak by miles.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:12.420
(laughing)

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:17.233
- The local cottage
cheese, set this on top.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.560
That is like cottage cheese
with organic herbs in it.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.220
Yeah, you're gonna put
this cottage cheese,

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.003
just smother every single bite in it.

00:12:38.115 --> 00:12:39.630
This is something you want to be eating

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:40.650
when you're on a mountain.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.460
Okay, next up is the
soup that she has today

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.190
which is called Daodao,
which is that noodle,

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:49.560
but it's actually, I
think, like dough pieces,

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.380
but I guess that's what
a noodle is anyways.

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.110
There's some herbs in here.

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:54.010
Look at that soup.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:13:01.190
Mm, oh, it has this wonderful,
unexpected sourness to it,

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:03.970
and then you really taste the herbs.

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:05.920
Like, it tastes like a mountain mint.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.840
Those are like little gummy noodles,

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.572
but what I like is that
amazing herb taste.

00:13:12.572 --> 00:13:14.310
(mellow music)

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:15.352
Thank you very much, it was amazing.

00:13:15.352 --> 00:13:17.230
- Welcome, welcome.
- Amazing.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.700
Yeah, when you're in Hunza Valley,

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.527
she's just down from the Baltit Fort

00:13:23.103 --> 00:13:25.778
- The store name is Hunza Fort Pavilion,

00:13:25.778 --> 00:13:26.650
outside.
- [Mark] Hunza Fort Pavilion.

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.170
- Yeah, Hunza Fort Pavilion.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.458
- [Mark] What was your name again?

00:13:29.458 --> 00:13:30.805
- Laoshizadee.

00:13:30.805 --> 00:13:32.032
- [Mark] Laoshizadee.

00:13:32.032 --> 00:13:34.113
Yeah, this is the spot.

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.020
Oh yeah, you can see Hunza Food Pavilion.

00:13:40.008 --> 00:13:42.680
(van sputters)

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.100
Okay, from here, we're
driving back to the hotel,

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.470
and they've prepared a local lunch for us,

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.160
so we're gonna go have
lunch, another lunch,

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.780
and then we will proceed
onwards from there,

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.670
but then tonight is gonna be
a very special opportunity

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.320
because we've invited to a local home

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.988
to have a local Hunza food experience.

00:13:58.988 --> 00:14:01.144
(enchanted instrumental music)

00:14:01.144 --> 00:14:06.144
Come on, Micah.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:07.674
Here's something I've never done before.

00:14:07.674 --> 00:14:09.424
(upbeat guitar music)

00:14:09.424 --> 00:14:11.674
(laughing)

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:14.603
I can't do it.

00:14:14.603 --> 00:14:16.070
Okay, I'm gonna have to use my hand.

00:14:17.268 --> 00:14:20.101
(apple crunching)

00:14:21.824 --> 00:14:22.657
Awe, Mm.

00:14:24.889 --> 00:14:26.360
It's so crisp.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.770
It's so juicy.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.113
Perfect, a perfect apple.

00:14:32.902 --> 00:14:34.940
(apple crunching)

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.553
It's still attached.

00:14:36.553 --> 00:14:37.870
(laughing)

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:40.006
- [Ali] Is that the copyright
book, can I also do it?

00:14:40.006 --> 00:14:40.839
- You can do it too.

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:41.672
(laughing)

00:14:41.672 --> 00:14:43.790
I'm sure anyone who grew
up around apples has done

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.400
that before, but that's a first for me.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.981
I didn't grow up around cold
weather where they grow apples.

00:14:48.981 --> 00:14:51.320
(apple crunching)

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.153
Thank you very much.

00:14:52.153 --> 00:14:53.400
- Welcome to--
- Thank you.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.540
So, we just sat down.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.400
We're gonna have a quick lunch,

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.910
and they're gonna prepare
a local Hunza food meal

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.103
for us for lunch today at the hotel.

00:15:01.103 --> 00:15:02.420
(speaking foreign language)

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:06.060
Thin layers of dough
which have then been fried

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.450
and then stuffed with that,

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:10.300
looks like that similar cottage
cheese which we just ate.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.890
Almost has like a cheese
dumpling taste to it,

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:19.070
but it's more like layers.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:19.953
Thank you very much.

00:15:19.953 --> 00:15:20.786
(speaking foreign language)

00:15:20.786 --> 00:15:21.892
Okay, next dish.

00:15:21.892 --> 00:15:25.240
Oh, there's chunks of
meat in this one, nice.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.603
Looks very familiar.

00:15:34.445 --> 00:15:36.560
This one is good too.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.480
It's a little less herbaceous
than the one we just had

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.163
before, but this one has
a little more meat in it.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.380
Main course has arrived.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.390
Two separate things, one is the lamb.

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:50.340
Again, the other is Harissa

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:53.460
which is a traditional
staple made with wheat,

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:57.055
looks like almost made
into a porridge-like paste.

00:15:57.055 --> 00:15:58.900
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.180
And silent, digging into that lamb.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:04.058
- If I talk a lot during eating,
I mean, there's a problem.

00:16:04.058 --> 00:16:06.308
(laughing)

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.233
- Oh yeah.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:13.803
The ginger.

00:16:14.867 --> 00:16:16.000
But that's just like lamb roast.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.833
Yeah, that's delicious.

00:16:16.833 --> 00:16:18.440
I think it's just been like,

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.090
taste like it's just been boiled.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:22.700
The lamb is good but I
think it would be better

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.073
with some kind of a sauce.

00:16:24.073 --> 00:16:27.740
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:16:28.717 --> 00:16:29.550
Oh, that's good.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.020
You can taste kind of like
the buttery-ness of it,

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.700
but it's really creamy,

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.840
and then you can taste the
grains of wheat as well.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.720
Final course is dessert,
and it's in this little,

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.640
looks like almost a little
pudding with some grapes

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.640
on the side, and there's
some almonds on top.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.344
I'm gonna grab that mint leaf as well.

00:16:45.344 --> 00:16:49.011
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:16:51.172 --> 00:16:52.937
Kind of has like a pumpkin taste to it.

00:16:52.937 --> 00:16:54.907
Oh, the beloved apricot oil.

00:16:54.907 --> 00:16:58.260
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.110
Finished with lunch.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.270
The food is kind of on the plainer side,

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.560
but it was, yeah, very
good, quality ingredients.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.930
You could taste the
freshness of the ingredients.

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:08.680
Actually, that was a very late
lunch because it's almost,

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.180
it's gonna be sunset pretty
soon so we gotta rush,

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:15.704
and it's about a 30-minute
drive to get to the sunset spot.

00:17:15.704 --> 00:17:19.537
(ethereal contemporary music)

00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:23.050
But have we gained quite
a lot of elevation.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.690
But this place is called the Eagles Nest.

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:29.320
Oh, it's cold up here.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.370
It's cold, Micah, are you cold?

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.660
So, we sorta missed the sunset because

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.900
it already has gone down below the peak

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.480
but the view is absolutely spectacular,

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.260
and you can see all the different
colors of purple and blue.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.660
There's so much snow on those peaks,

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.820
and then down here, this
is the main Hunza Valley

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.540
where the Karimabad,
where we were staying,

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.074
and I believe that's what
they call Ladyfinger.

00:17:52.074 --> 00:17:55.390
That's such a jagged, sharp peak.

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:59.223
(ethereal contemporary music)

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:10.200
The actual sun is shining
onto these peaks over here.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.185
They're monstrous, and then so much snow.

00:18:13.185 --> 00:18:14.793
You're starting to see more colors.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:19.400
Yeah, we gained some elevation.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.263
I can feel that.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.340
Yeah, it's chilly up here too.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.970
- I was thinking about it over there,

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:28.930
like, if you could ever say
that something could top this,

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:31.320
you'd have to, like, leave the earth.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.740
- [Mark] Otherworldly.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.090
- Yes.

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.270
- Okay, I think we're getting out of here.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:38.350
It is freezing cold, but it's a truly

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:41.420
an epic viewpoint, just 360 all around.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.992
It's mind blowing.

00:18:42.992 --> 00:18:46.825
(ethereal contemporary music)

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:50.970
For dinner tonight, we've been invited

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.920
by a local family to eat
at their home arranged

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.890
by the minister of tourism GB,

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:58.220
so we're just on our way there now.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.020
Okay, so we've met up with our host,

00:19:01.108 --> 00:19:02.290
and he's taking us down.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:06.040
This is a very unique area
of town, watery streets,

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.940
and we're also very close
to the Altit Fort, right?

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:10.773
- Yeah.

00:19:10.773 --> 00:19:11.970
- Okay, thank you,

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.540
and this is where your home is?

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.470
- [Guide] Yeah, of course.

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:16.930
- [Mark] Wow, very cool.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:20.263
- Yeah, most of the
houses are built of stone.

00:19:20.263 --> 00:19:23.279
(Pakistani instrumental music)

00:19:23.279 --> 00:19:24.890
- It's so cool walking
back in these streets.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:25.990
I mean, you can really walk back

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.082
into some really narrow, narrow lanes.

00:19:28.082 --> 00:19:32.400
You can see the walls made of
stone and mud construction,

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.290
and I think we arrived at the house.

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:35.590
Thank you.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:39.805
- [Guide] Okay, so this was
in the border of the house

00:19:39.805 --> 00:19:42.388
so it came just--
- [Mark] Wow.

00:19:43.435 --> 00:19:47.428
- Karimalhan Hasaramom, he had
visited this house specially.

00:19:47.428 --> 00:19:51.011
(rhythmic Pakistani music)

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.040
- [Mark] Nice to meet you.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.076
Thank you.

00:19:55.076 --> 00:19:58.659
(rhythmic Pakistani music)

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.860
Very cool, very cozy on the
inside of this carpeted,

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:07.630
and with pads on the floor,

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:11.380
and then this is within
one of the stone homes.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.875
It's beautiful, and this is amazing.

00:20:13.875 --> 00:20:15.210
(clapping)

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.793
(rhythmic Pakistani music)

00:20:22.153 --> 00:20:23.927
(applause)

00:20:23.927 --> 00:20:26.010
And this house has a lot of historical

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:27.973
important significance as well.

00:20:29.455 --> 00:20:31.750
It's like a museum of a home because

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.533
it's so well preserved, and so ancient.

00:20:33.533 --> 00:20:36.950
(upbeat Pakistani music)

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:47.743
The first course which is the soup.

00:20:47.743 --> 00:20:49.960
DaoDao, DaoDao, it's called DaoDao.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.030
I have the extreme honor
of sitting next to Grandma

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.450
who is an amazing lady.

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:55.790
This is her house.

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:57.493
She's welcomed us into her house,

00:20:58.474 --> 00:21:00.490
and this looks like a hearty soup.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:04.320
You can see those
dough-like, pieces of dough

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.310
which are in the soup.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:08.338
It looks almost like a
porridge because it's so thick.

00:21:08.338 --> 00:21:12.005
(speaking foreign language)

00:21:17.068 --> 00:21:17.901
- 85.

00:21:19.762 --> 00:21:21.929
- Wow, she's 85-years old.

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:24.480
She's beautiful.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.873
She's absolutely beautiful.

00:21:33.732 --> 00:21:34.713
Oh, that's amazing.

00:21:36.499 --> 00:21:38.380
It's really hardy and warm,

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.100
and compared to other versions we had,

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.749
this has more of the noodles
in it, so it's more hardy.

00:21:43.749 --> 00:21:47.300
(rhythmic Pakistani music)

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.307
Okay, again, I think I said
this earlier today, but this is

00:21:50.307 --> 00:21:53.490
the soup that you want to be
eating when it's cold outside.

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:57.073
(rhythmic Pakistani music)

00:21:59.489 --> 00:22:02.060
Okay, they're just bringing
out more and more dishes,

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.653
but all local Hunza dishes.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.950
This one's very interesting.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:11.400
It's potato with apricot seed paste.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.720
And he just brought out
an apricot seed chapati,

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.920
so inside is an apricot taste
but I think it's apricot seed,

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.320
which is almost like almond.

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:26.460
That almost tastes like a
spring onion, like cream cheese

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.193
but then it's like nutty.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.333
Wow.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:34.273
That's like refreshing and kind of oniony.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.471
All right.

00:22:38.471 --> 00:22:40.710
I'm gonna try the rose
dumpling next and, yeah, it's

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.520
wrapped up but filled with yak meat,

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.090
and then there's a sauce.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.572
Yeah, that's like a giant dumpling.

00:22:46.572 --> 00:22:47.872
I think it is a one biter.

00:22:53.772 --> 00:22:56.355
Yeah, that's a big bite though.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.971
It's like right at that
stage where you're not sure.

00:22:59.971 --> 00:23:02.061
And that tastes like a sweet,

00:23:02.061 --> 00:23:03.680
kind of like apricot sauce.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.430
Okay, next up, I'm
gonna try the pasta dish

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:08.180
which is made from wheat.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.110
Look like little sheets, and then shaved,

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:11.839
and then cooked up with a vegetable.

00:23:11.839 --> 00:23:15.422
(rhythmic Pakistani music)

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.430
Oh, it has like this
wonderful sourness to it,

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:22.650
and then you can taste the
herbs, a slight bitter vegetable.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:26.595
This one is the potato with
the apricot seed paste.

00:23:26.595 --> 00:23:30.178
(rhythmic Pakistani music)

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.330
Oh wow.

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:34.770
That's like the greatest mashed potatoes

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:36.467
you've ever had in your life.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.530
It's so natural tasting, and
then the potatoes just dissolve

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:44.020
in your mouth, and just
so nutritious tasting.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:46.460
Okay, next up for the
Chapshoro, and this is something

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.110
we've had already a couple of times today,

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:51.040
but this is really one of
the local staple foods.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.072
This one is loaded with yak meat.

00:23:53.072 --> 00:23:56.655
(rhythmic Pakistani music)

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.100
You can taste the onions in there,

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:01.840
and they're just wrapped
up in that mince meat.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.290
Yeah, and that one has a
little more spice to it.

00:24:06.296 --> 00:24:09.233
(speaking foreign language)

00:24:09.233 --> 00:24:12.816
(rhythmic Pakistani music)

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:15.830
Okay, one more dish that I didn't try yet

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:18.580
filled with cheese on
the inside, and kind of,

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:20.248
again, the thin layers of dough.

00:24:20.248 --> 00:24:23.831
(rhythmic Pakistani music)

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:29.000
Oh, that's like a really kind
of sour, like, cream cheese

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.030
kind of sensation, fully organic,

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:34.410
just creme Hunza Valley,
everything we're eating.

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:36.820
In the Hunza Valley, they are
known for being very healthy,

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:40.680
and many old people, and many,
a very high life expectancy,

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.450
because of the fresh air,

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:43.830
and especially because of the food.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:46.160
And so one of the very traditional dishes

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.490
that we've been eating and, actually,

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.500
it's probably my favorite
dish of the entire meal,

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:54.500
is the chapati which is filled
with the apricot seed paste,

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.100
as well as walnuts, and I
think there's some apricot oil

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.270
as well, and that it one of the dishes,

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:04.430
that is one of the traditional
foods of the Hunza Valley

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:07.240
that is credited with longevity

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.303
and the health, the good health.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:12.680
Oh, the mint in that bite.

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:16.080
Yeah, that's one of the best dishes.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:16.913
What is that, Mr. Ali?

00:25:16.913 --> 00:25:18.453
- I'm holding that secret for you.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:21.387
The real secret of longevity.

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:23.280
- [Mark] Desserts.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.910
- This one bite gonna add one more year.

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:27.890
One bite adds one more year.

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:33.083
Wow, amazing.

00:25:39.286 --> 00:25:41.492
- Wow.

00:25:41.492 --> 00:25:45.233
Oh, the honey, it tastes like
caramelized honey in there.

00:25:46.867 --> 00:25:49.073
And then you got that tart, cherry jam.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.742
Wow, that's like a juicy,
honey-filled pancake.

00:25:52.742 --> 00:25:56.159
(upbeat Pakistani music)

00:26:00.428 --> 00:26:03.670
That was an unbelievable
experience, with the music,

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:07.760
the food, the family,
having the honor to sit next

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:12.233
to Grandma as she just smiled,
and then just that food.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:14.243
Watch your step.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.160
Oh, we just figured out
that this is a 400-year,

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.970
they mentioned this a 400-year old house.

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:23.420
Wow, yeah, that was so cool.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.310
- What a treat.

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:26.550
- Yeah, a privilege.
- A real treat, yeah.

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:27.500
- [Man] Mind your head, Sir.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.956
- [Mark] Okay, thank you.

00:26:28.956 --> 00:26:32.373
(upbeat Pakistani music)

00:26:36.061 --> 00:26:36.894
Cat.

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:46.700
Thank you very much.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:47.630
- [Man] This is traditions.

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:48.800
- Okay, thank you.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.541
- [Man] Traditions.

00:26:50.541 --> 00:26:51.979
Thank you.

00:26:51.979 --> 00:26:54.812
(room chattering)

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.720
- [Man] Please, please.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.220
- Shalom, welcome.

00:27:05.361 --> 00:27:06.240
Shalom, welcome.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.090
- Wasn't even sure what we were
gonna do, but we drove over,

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:12.950
and we were invited to
another house, another home.

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:16.053
This is really old, ancient
home, another stone home,

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.730
and we're all huddled around,

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.370
and they're sitting by the fire,

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:23.723
and I think they're preparing
something to eat again.

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:29.000
Wow, this is spectacular,

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.893
and what a warm welcome they gave us.

00:27:32.311 --> 00:27:33.202
There's a big ...

00:27:33.202 --> 00:27:34.630
(speaking foreign language)

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:37.463
(room chattering)

00:27:45.313 --> 00:27:48.123
I'm not totally sure what
they're gonna make yet.

00:27:49.328 --> 00:27:51.210
(speaking foreign language)

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:54.350
He's 86-years old, and he was in the army.

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:57.000
He has all these medals on his jacket,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
and then this uncle is 72-years old,

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:04.810
72-years old.

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:08.373
It's such an unbelievable,
cultural learning experience.

00:28:10.054 --> 00:28:12.517
(speaking foreign language)

00:28:12.517 --> 00:28:14.119
(room chattering)

00:28:14.119 --> 00:28:16.786
(food sizzling)

00:28:21.845 --> 00:28:25.012
(utensils clattering)

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:30.487
(upbeat Pakistani music)

00:28:50.948 --> 00:28:54.120
First they made this like flat
roti and then, after that,

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.890
they made pancakes so
that you get this batter

00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:59.840
which she swirled onto the
hot plate, and then swirled

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.730
into a pancake shape, and
then flipped it, and then

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:04.520
it just sizzled, and
just bubbled away again.

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.353
We've got chai.

00:29:05.353 --> 00:29:06.470
We've got a plate of grapes.

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:09.160
We've got the pancake, a Hunza pancake,

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.530
so you almost cannot explain
this entire situation,

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:17.110
and experience, and
cultural beauty in words.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:18.760
Okay, but let's test the pancake.

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:23.730
You can really taste that butter
which is just fresh butter.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:25.600
That tastes really good,
and then the pancake, yeah,

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:29.590
it has a wonderful kind of
gummy, spongy texture to it.

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:32.593
Home cooked, yeah, it's wonderful.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.780
Oh yeah, I'm toasty warm,
actually, almost sweating

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.770
right now because I'm sitting
by the fire drinking tea,

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:44.250
but it feels so good.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:47.833
(rhythmic Pakistani music)

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:52.170
And they're seedless.

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:55.213
Oh man, just like perfectly sour and tart,

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.990
and juicy, and the seedless is great.

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:02.743
Then, immediately chase
that with some of the chai.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.193
Thank you very much.

00:30:05.193 --> 00:30:08.812
(speaking foreign language)

00:30:09.684 --> 00:30:10.796
Thank you, I can get it.

00:30:10.796 --> 00:30:11.629
- [Man] Okay, no problem.

00:30:11.629 --> 00:30:12.533
- Thank you very much.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.663
This is just kind of the entrance area,

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:19.340
entrance area of the house.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.060
Okay, so we're heading
out of the house now but,

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:25.373
yeah, it was just an honor
to sit with the family.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.530
Every generation was present,
and just to eat the pancakes,

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:33.130
to drink tea, everything
cooked fresh before us.

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:35.873
It was spectacular and special.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.697
Yeah, it was an honor to
have that opportunity.

00:30:39.697 --> 00:30:43.298
(rhythmic Pakistani music)

00:30:43.298 --> 00:30:44.343
Thank you.

00:30:44.343 --> 00:30:46.860
From the outside, it just
looks so dark and quiet,

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:50.040
but then you step inside,
and there's like 20 people,

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.730
all family, inside.

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:53.593
It's so cozy and warm too.

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:55.812
Wow.

00:30:55.812 --> 00:30:57.520
That was amazing.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.370
That was amazing.

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:02.250
Okay, thank you.

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:03.700
Thank you very much.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.216
- You too.
- Nice to meet you.

00:31:05.216 --> 00:31:07.860
(upbeat Pakistani music)

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.273
Bye-bye, nice to meet you.

00:31:10.896 --> 00:31:13.300
Okay, made it back to the hotel.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.830
It is a chilly evening.

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:16.650
Massive thank you to Suleiman,

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:20.560
who is the director of tourism
in GB, Gilgit-Baltistan,

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.030

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:25.010
and for Ali from Landmark
Communications and Travels

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:27.700
for arranging everything this entire trip.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.080
Okay, so that's gonna
be it for this video.

early, and a long day.

We're going up to the Kunjerab Pass.

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.680
We're also gonna have some local food.

00:31:37.537 --> 00:31:39.390

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:41.260
