[soft music]

00:00:04.953 --> 00:00:07.953
[audience cheering]

00:00:16.977 --> 00:00:19.520
&gt;&gt; Good evening and welcome
to Biola University.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.057
My name is Craig Hazen,
and I'm the director

00:00:22.057 --> 00:00:25.480
the the Master of Arts program
in Christan Apologetics here

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.700
and I'm honored to be the host tonight

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.520
to get things started.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.410
Although the gym is packed
with nearly 3,000 people

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.330
and it looks like you're
stuffed in here pretty well,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.573
and my condolences to those of you who

00:00:36.573 --> 00:00:38.610
have already been sitting
an hour and have another

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.000
couple of hours to go, hang in there.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.530
Hang in there.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.870
But you're not the only ones watching.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.360
There are thousands of
people in other venues

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.660
on this campus.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.060
Not only that, there are
people in overflow sites,

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.620
really across the country
and around the world.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.210
We have people in 30 states
and four different countries

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.860
watching this and a special
greeting to all of you who

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.960
are watching across campus
and in places such as

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.890
Stockholm and Sri Lanka.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.250
I hope you really enjoy this.
[audience cheering]

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.690
A special greeting to some
distinguished guests tonight.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.490
William Lane Craig's wife, Jan, is here.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.670
Jan, it's good to see you.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.953
Betsey Hewitt is here.
[audience applause]

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.800
My wife, Karen Hazen, is here.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.373
Dr. Barry Corey, the
university president, is here.

00:01:35.674 --> 00:01:40.674
[audience cheering]
[applause]

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.120
Yeah, we've got distinguished philosophers

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.953
all over the place.

00:01:43.953 --> 00:01:45.873
Doug Given, JP Morton, hi-ho.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.220
All right.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.400
We're thrilled all of you could come.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.980
Well this event was initiated by

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.210
the Associated Students
of Biola University,

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.280
and it makes sense that
AS President Eric Weaver

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.066
should give a quick welcome on behalf

00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:01.590
of the student body.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.533
Eric, come on up.
[audience applause]

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.183
&gt;&gt; Good evening, everyone.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.600
Biola is a 100 year old
Christian un&amp;iversity,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.720
which desires to wrestle
with big questions

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.060
in an honest and open way.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.610
In my senior year, my AS
colleague, Mark Keith, and I,

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.203
thought we should sponsor
a blockbuster event

00:02:30.203 --> 00:02:33.880
that pursues the biggest question of all:

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.790
it is reasonable to
believe that God exists?

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.010
A proposal was presented to the Senate

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.973
and the student body heartily agreed.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.660
So we invited two
acclaimed academic leaders

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.073
in this area, William Lane
Craig, and Christopher Hitchens,

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.000
and along with the
wonderful people from the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.100
Apologetics program, we
are thrilled to see it

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.100
on display tonight.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.320
On behalf of the students
at Biola, I hope you really

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.470
enjoy this event.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.837
Thank you.
[audience applause]

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.398
&gt;&gt; Thank you for representing
the students, Eric.

00:03:16.398 --> 00:03:17.390
You're a senior.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.200
How's that job search
going in this economy?

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.927
Is that going well?
[audience laughing]

00:03:21.927 --> 00:03:23.177
We'll give you some help.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.413
Oh no, our career services
on Biola, first rank.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.883
Thank you.

00:03:29.883 --> 00:03:31.640
Well, the students got this going,

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.100
but there is one other important sponsor,

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.440
and that is the program that I direct,

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.390
the Master of Arts Program
in Christian Apologetics.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.400
If you like wrestling
with the big questions,

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.850
the existence of God,
evidence for the resurrection,

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.180
and the problem of evil,
the historical reliability

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.610
of the Bible reconciling
science and faith,

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.780
this really is a degree program for you.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.650
And if you're watching
at a distance and you're

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.047
thinking, "I can't do
it 'cause I don't live

00:03:53.047 --> 00:03:55.550
"in Southern California,"
that's not the case.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.070
We have this amazing
distance learning program

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.830
and it's really open to
anybody and you don't need

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.660
to relocate to Southern California,

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.660
although it was a very nice day today.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.740
You might want to consider it.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.480
Although, they've just
taxed us into oblivion,

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.463
so you may wanna reconsider that.

00:04:14.216 --> 00:04:15.560
If you want to find out
about these programs,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.560
check out Biola.edu, B-I-O-L-A.edu,

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.060
and go to the Christian
Apologetics page on that site.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.893
Well.

00:04:25.893 --> 00:04:27.570
How is this all gonna work tonight?

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.820
It's pretty straight forward.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.910
In fact, your hand dandy
program will tell you what's

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.240
going on, right up at
the top, inside panel,

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.350
the program numbers one through eight.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.820
It'll guide you through
what's taking place

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.593
every step of the way during the debate.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.729
So take a look at that.

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.470
Toward the end, we will have
some time for questions,

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.630
but as you notice there's no mics

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.990
sitting up in the aisles.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.650
We are going to throw
it open to the students.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.823
We have a student section up there, bravo.

00:04:55.116 --> 00:04:57.960
[audience cheering]

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.320
Students of all stripes.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.650
Now it's your job tonight to think up

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.853
some tough questions, and I
expect you to actually vet them.

00:05:05.853 --> 00:05:08.450
That is, you may have learn
in school that there is

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.653
no such thing as a dumb question.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.140
That is not true, okay?
[audience laughing]

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.180
Not to intimidate you, but, check it out.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.013
Do a peer review.

00:05:20.013 --> 00:05:21.940
If you come with a question,
run it by the person

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.070
next to you or on either side,

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.670
and let's see how it goes.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.197
So we'll throw it open
for some Q and A time

00:05:28.197 --> 00:05:32.000
and our thoughtful moderator
will make sure it goes well.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.833
All right.

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:33.730
Well when we're done tonight,

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.550
there's one other thing
you need to be considering,

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.980
and that is getting
outside of this building

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.370
to the pavilion right outside here

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.360
and several places along the walk way

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.060
to pick up the featured books tonight.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.050
One is God Is Not Great
by Christopher Hitchens,

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.280
and another one is Reasonable
Faith by William Lane Craig.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.900
These are the featured books.
[audience cheering]

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.150
Pick them up, and you can
actually have them signed.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.980
To have them signed, just
walk out these building,

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.870
look for all the lights,
and there's some tables

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.180
out there and our distinguished
debaters will be out

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.960
there signing books and
answering your toughest questions

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.210
right there at the table, I'm sure.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.390
If you've got a lot of books at home,

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.740
and in fact you own a book so
you don't need another one,

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.920
perhaps you can buy
some DVDs or CDs of some

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.530
dynamite debates and
lectures that Bill Craig

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.780
has done around the world.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.760
These are first rate materials and our

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.030
Apologetics program is
actually the center point

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.540
for getting all of these,
so if you wanna get

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.237
them tonight, they've got
wonderful, special deals.

00:06:30.237 --> 00:06:33.170
Check out the red flyer in your brochure

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.800
and that will tell you the scoop.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.460
You can even pre-order tonight's debate.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.110
If you'd like to get a copy of it,

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.550
it's something you want to
share with a lot of people,

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.610
you can pre-order it
tonight, fill out the form,

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.653
take it to the table, and
they'll move you right through.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.340
Well we're delighted to
have Mr. Hitchens here

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.550
on campus be we realize
that we theists certainly

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.760
have the home court
advantage, I mean being in

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.330
a basketball court, that
makes a lot of sense.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.200
After all, it's a Christian university

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.260
and it even says, "All glory to God"

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.350
or something above the bleachers there,

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.160
so clearly this is a home court
advantage for the theists.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.200
And I imagine that the crowd here is over

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.910
two thirds Evangelical Christian,

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.720
although I'm thrilled to
see some of the atheist

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.700
and agnostic community
turn out wearing t-shirts.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.860
I love that.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.883
Yeah, absolutely, yeah.
[audience applause]

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.260
I was lecturing at the
University of South Florida

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.520
a few weeks ago and
the entire atheist club

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.920
came out wearing t-shirts
and we had the best time ever

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.380
so I expect the same tonight.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.213
Well.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.270
Since we have the home court advantage,

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.030
those of you who are
theists, believers in God,

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.610
please, let's be polite
to Christopher Hitchens.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.370
He's known to say a
provocative thing or two

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:51.363
so if you can practice
your polite, golf clap.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.200
[audience laughing]
All right?

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.850
Let's practice that.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:56.683
Practice that.

00:07:56.683 --> 00:07:58.650
No shouting, no hooting.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.450
There will be plenty
of opportunity for it,

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.220
but let's restrain ourselves.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.870
And those of you who are from the atheist

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:08.710
and agonistic community,
again, no shouting,

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.400
no hooting, no hollering.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.960
In fact, Mr. Hitchens,
I can guarantee you,

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.680
doesn't really need a lot of help.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.093
I just saw a video of
him debating like four

00:08:16.093 --> 00:08:19.970
prominent Evangelical Theists in Dallas,

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.683
and it really wasn't fair.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.090
We needed more theists on the panel,

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.240
so I think he will do just fine,

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.820
but we're grateful for
him to come to sort of

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:35.640
the pit of opposition at Biola University.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.050
But we're grateful to
really open up the doors

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.800
and run through these
big, important questions,

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.290
and if the debate is
not resolved at the end,

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:45.660
this is a basketball
court for goodness sakes,

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.090
we'll lower the hoops,
we'll turn up the lights,

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:49.843
and we'll let 'em go one on one.

00:08:51.179 --> 00:08:54.550
[audience applause]

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.166
Yeah.

00:08:56.166 --> 00:09:00.023
I hear Chris has game, so
we'll see how that goes.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.050
Well let's get to it.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.530
It's my pleasure to
introduce our moderator

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:09.130
of the debate tonight, and
he'll get this party started.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.063
Hugh Hewitt.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.843
Yes, Hugh Hewitt.
[audience applause]

00:09:20.883 --> 00:09:22.430
Hugh is a law professor
and broadcast journalist

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:25.360
whose nationally syndicated
radio show is heard

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.960
in more than 120 cities
across the United States

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.000
every week day by more
than two million listeners.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.030
By the way locally this
program is heard on KRLA

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:36.320
which is 870 am.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.020
I think it goes from like three to six.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.480
Great program, in fact, I
think it's one of the most

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.970
important, smartest, fast
paced news and issues

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.500
program on the airwaves today.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.550

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.700
He's always been so very
generous with his time

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.150
toward events like these at Biola,

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.360
and we are deeply grateful
for his help here tonight.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.093
Join me in welcoming our
moderator, Professor Hugh Hewitt.

00:10:46.567 --> 00:10:49.567
[audience applause]

00:10:54.854 --> 00:10:57.604
&gt;&gt; Thank you ladies and gentlemen.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.210
Number one, please turn
off your cell phones.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.020
I repeat, please turn
off your cell phones.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.300
Number two, gentlemen, to the
extent that any of you have

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.990
jackets that are still on, please,

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:08.680
as Ronald Reagan once used to say,

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.420
feel free to just throw them on the floor.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.160
It is a little bit warm in here.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.980
Our guests, by virtue of this crowd,

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.760
it is obvious, need no introduction.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.860
I am not going to waste time, then,

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.040
on elaborate introductions.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.970
I just wish to thank them
both for being willing

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.830
to participate in this most
important of conversations.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.950
It is the best of times,
it is the best of times,

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.850
for those who like to argue
about God in the public square.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:31.580
Largely because of the
rise of new atheists,

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.530
such as Mr. Hitchens, Richard Dawkins,

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.490
my friend William Lobdell, and others,

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.110
who have once again put at the
center of the public stage,

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:40.220
the question of whether
or not God does exist

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.170
and whether or not
Jesus Christ is his son.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.130
And it is up to people
like William Lane Craig,

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.490
prolific author and much
beloved professor here,

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:47.983
to enter into that conversation in a way

00:11:47.983 --> 00:11:50.460
that is most persuasive and winsome.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.550
And so without further
ado, allow me to welcome

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.510
up Vanity Fair columnist, prolific author,

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:57.873
my friend, and champion of
freedom, Christopher Hitchens.

00:12:00.095 --> 00:12:03.095
[audience applause]

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:14.083
And from this,

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.140
from this extraordinary
lighthouse institution,

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.210
another prolific author, an apologist,

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.960
a scholar extraordinaire,
who like Mr. Hitchens,

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.070
has his PhD from a wonderful
English university,

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.470
Professor William Lane
Craig, please, professor.

00:12:32.452 --> 00:12:35.452
[audience applause]

00:12:45.916 --> 00:12:47.060
This is a very structured debate,

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.240
according to classical
lines until the questions

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.073
at the end.

00:12:50.073 --> 00:12:52.100
We begin with an opening
argument, 20 minutes,

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:52.990
to Professor Craig.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.823
Professor?

00:12:57.439 --> 00:13:00.439
[audience applause]

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:08.810
&gt;&gt; Good evening.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.176
I am very excited to be participating

00:13:11.176 --> 00:13:13.150
in this debate tonight.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.290
Jan and I used to sit
in those very bleachers

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:19.200
right over there watching our son John

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.410
run up and down this court as a forward

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.050
on the Biola Eagles.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:26.820
And so I feel like I'm playing
at the home court tonight.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.580
And I wanna commend Mr.
Hitchens for his willingness

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.640
to come into this den of lambs

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.853
and to defend his views tonight.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.460
On the other hand, if
I know Biola students,

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.020
I suspected a good many of
you, when you came in tonight,

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.327
said to yourself, "I'm gonna
check my own views at the door,

00:13:45.327 --> 00:13:48.247
"and I'm gonna assess the
arguments as objectively

00:13:48.247 --> 00:13:49.660
"as possible."

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.360
I welcome that challenge.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.740
You see the question of God's
existence is of interest

00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:00.360
not only to religion,
but also to philosophy.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.530
Now Mr. Hitchens has made it clear that he

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.820
despises and disdains religion,

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:10.210
but presumably he is not so
contemptuous of philosophy.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:12.920
Therefore, as a professional philosopher,

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.490
I'm going to approach tonight's
question philosophically,

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.680
from the standpoint of
reason and argument.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.230
I'm convinced that there
are better arguments

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:25.350
for theism than for atheism.

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:27.680
So, in tonight's debate,
I'm going to defend

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.720
two basic contentions.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:34.720
First, that there's no good
arguments that atheism is true.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:38.080
And secondly, that
there are good arguments

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.143
that theism is true.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.513
Now, notice carefully
the circumscribed limits

00:14:44.513 --> 00:14:46.960
of those contentions.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.740
We're not here tonight
to debate the social

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.750
impact of religion or
Old Testament ethics,

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.700
or Biblical inerrancy.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.470
All interesting and
important topics, no doubt,

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:00.880
but not the subject of tonight's debate,

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.560
which is the existence of God.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.730
Consider, then, my first contention,

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.679
that there's no good argument
that atheism is true.

00:15:10.679 --> 00:15:13.220
Atheists have tried for centuries

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.330
to disprove the existence of God,

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.060
but no one's ever been able to come up

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.870
with a successful argument.

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:22.230
So, rather than attack
strong men at this point,

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.030
I'll just wait to hear
Mr. Hitchens present his

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:28.360
arguments against God's
existence, and then

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.300
I'll respond to them in my next speech.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:34.370
In the meantime, let's turn
to my second main contention,

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:38.020
that there are good arguments
that theism is true.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:42.590
On your program insert, I
outlined some of those arguments.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:46.163
Number one, the cosmological argument.

00:15:47.096 --> 00:15:50.370
The question of why anything at all exists

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:54.373
is the most profound
question of philosophy.

00:15:54.373 --> 00:15:57.167
The philosopher Derek Parfit says,

00:15:57.167 --> 00:16:01.547
"No question is more sublime
than why there is a universe,

00:16:01.547 --> 00:16:05.430
"why there is anything
rather than nothing."

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:07.620
Typically atheists have
answered this question

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:12.230
by saying that the universe
is just eternal and uncaused.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.600
But there are good reasons,
both philosophically

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.480
and scientifically, to
think that the universe

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.640
began to exist.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.690
Philosophically, the idea of
an infinite past seems absurd.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:27.900
Just think about it: If the
universe never began to exist,

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.330
that means that the number of past events

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:34.060
in the history of the
universe is infinite.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.930
But mathematicians recognize
that the existence of an

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.870
actually infinite number of things leads

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.640
to self-contradictions.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:46.180
For example, what is
infinity minus infinity?

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.810
Well, mathematically you get
self-contradictory answers.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:53.200
This shows that infinity is
just an idea in your mind,

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.930
but not something that exists in reality.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.600
David Hilbert, perhaps the
greatest mathematician of the

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.757
20th century, wrote,
"The infinite is nowhere

00:17:01.757 --> 00:17:03.747
"to be found in reality.

00:17:03.747 --> 00:17:07.467
"It neither exists in nature,
nor provides a legitimate

00:17:07.467 --> 00:17:09.527
"basis for rational thought.

00:17:09.527 --> 00:17:12.957
"The role that remains
for the infinite to play

00:17:12.957 --> 00:17:15.347
"is solely that of an idea."

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:20.170
But that entails that since
past events are not just ideas

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:24.540
but are real, the number of
past events must be finite,

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.030
therefore the series of past
events can't go back forever.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:31.583
Rather, the universe
must have begun to exist.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:35.290
This conclusion has been
confirmed by remarkable

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.680
discoveries in astronomy and astrophysics.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.710
In one of the most startling
developments of modern science

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:45.990
we now have pretty strong
evidence that the universe is not

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:50.060
eternal in the past but had
an absolute beginning about

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:53.940
13 billion years ago
in a cataclysmic event

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.840
known as the Big Bang.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.550
What makes the Big Bang so
startling is that it represents

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:03.800
the origin of the universe
from literally nothing,

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.050
for all matter and energy, even physical

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:12.050
space and time themselves, came
into being at the Big Bang.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.747
As the physicist P.C.W. Davies explains,

00:18:15.747 --> 00:18:18.797
"The coming into being of
the universe, as discussed in

00:18:18.797 --> 00:18:22.507
"modern science, is not just
a matter of imposing some

00:18:22.507 --> 00:18:26.937
"sort of organization upon
a previous incoherent state

00:18:26.937 --> 00:18:30.447
"but literally the coming into being of

00:18:30.447 --> 00:18:33.567
"all physical things from nothing."

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:38.200
Now, this puts the atheist
in a very awkward position.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.417
As Anthony Kenny of
Oxford University urges,

00:18:41.417 --> 00:18:43.337
"A proponent of the Big Bang theory,

00:18:43.337 --> 00:18:45.827
"at least if he is an atheist,

00:18:45.827 --> 00:18:48.497
"must believe that the universe came

00:18:48.497 --> 00:18:52.470
"from nothing and by nothing."

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:54.890
But surely that doesn't make sense.

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:57.570
Out of nothing, nothing comes.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.620
So why does the universe exist,

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.870
instead of just nothing,
where did it come from?

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:05.810
There must have been a cause which brought

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:08.300
the universe into being.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.980
Now as the cause of space and time,

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:16.980
this being must be an
uncaused, timeless, spaceless,

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.930
immaterial being of unfathomable power.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:24.440
Moreover, it must be personal as well.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.440
Why?

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.200
Because the cause must
be beyond space and time,

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.650
therefore it cannot be
physical or material.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.840
Now there are only two
kinds of things that fit

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.640
that description: either
an abstract object,

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:44.240
like numbers, or else a personal mind.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.030
But abstract objects can't cause anything.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.940
Therefore it follows that the cause of the

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:54.670
universe is a transcendent,
intelligent mind.

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:57.630
Thus the cosmological argument gives us a

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:01.249
personal creator of the universe.

00:20:01.249 --> 00:20:04.463
Two, the teleological argument.

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:08.470
In recent decades scientists
have been stunned by the

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:10.640
discovery that the initial conditions

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:14.220
of the Big Bang were fine
tuned for the existence

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.290
of intelligent life with a precision

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:21.950
and delicacy that literally
defied human comprehension.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.650
This fine tuning is of two sorts:

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:27.550
first, when the laws
of nature are expressed

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.540
as mathematical equations,

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.869
you find appearing in
them certain constants

00:20:31.869 --> 00:20:34.546
like the gravitational constant.

00:20:34.546 --> 00:20:38.900
These constants are not
determined by the laws of nature.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.160
The laws of nature are consistent with

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.610
a wide range of values
for these constants.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:47.520
Second, in addition to
these constants there

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.440
are certain arbitrary quantities put in

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.700
as initial conditions on which
the laws of nature operate.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.170
For example, the amount of
entropy or the balance between

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:01.222
matter and antimatter in the universe.

00:21:01.222 --> 00:21:04.210
Now all of these constants and quantities

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:07.770
fall into an extraordinarily narrow range

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:10.370
of life-permitting values.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:12.280
Were these constants or quantities

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.330
to be altered by less
than a hair's breath,

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:20.330
the balance would be destroyed
and life would not exist.

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.400
To give just one example:

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.420
The atomic weak force, if it
were altered by as little as

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:30.022
one part out of 10 to the 100th power

00:21:30.022 --> 00:21:34.690
would not have permitted a
life-permitting universe.

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.190
Now there are three
possible explanations of

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:41.120
this remarkable fine
tuning: physical necessity,

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.573
chance, or design.

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:47.100
Now it can't be due to
physical necessity because the

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.750
constants and quantities are independent

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:51.730
of the laws of nature.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:54.684
In fact string theory
predicts that there are around

00:21:54.684 --> 00:21:58.810
10 to the 500th power different possible

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:02.900
universes consistent with nature's laws.

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:06.340
So could the fine tuning be due to chance?

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:08.300
Well, the problem with this alternative

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.140
is that the odds against the fine tunings

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.805
occurring by accident
are so incomprehensibly

00:22:14.805 --> 00:22:18.210
great that they cannot
be reasonably faced.

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:21.162
The probability that all the constants

00:22:21.162 --> 00:22:25.310
and quantities would fall
by chance alone into the

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:30.020
infinitesimal life-permitting
range is vanishingly small.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:33.370
We now know that
life-prohibiting universes

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:38.210
are vastly more probable than
any life-permitting universe.

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:41.390
So if the universe were
the product of chance,

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:45.203
the odds are overwhelming that
it would be life-prohibiting.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.420
In order to rescue the
alternative of chance,

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.640
its proponents have therefore been forced

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:55.660
to resort to a radical
metaphysical hypothesis.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:59.570
Namely, that there
exists an infinite number

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:03.610
of randomly ordered,
undetectable universes

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.270
composing a sort of world ensemble

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:10.550
or multiverse of which our
universe is but a part.

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:14.320
Somewhere in this infinite
world ensemble finely tuned

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.070
universes will appear by chance alone

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:20.460
and we happen to be one such world.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:24.380
Now wholly apart from the fact
that there's no independent

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.620
evidence that such a world
ensemble even exists,

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:31.140
the hypothesis faces a
devastating objection,

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:36.140
namely, if our universe is
just a random member of an

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.970
infinite world ensemble then
it is overwhelmingly more

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:43.610
probably that we should be
observing a much different

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:46.270
universe than what we in fact observe.

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:49.010
Roger Penrose has calculated that it is

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:52.770
inconceivably more probable
that our solar system

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:56.220
should suddenly form
through a random collision

00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:00.220
of particles than that a finely
tuned universe should exist.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.930
Penrose calls it "utter
chicken feed" by comparison.

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:07.940
So, if our universe were
just a random member of

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:12.290
a world ensemble it is
inconceivably more probable

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.040
that we should be
observing an orderly region

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.080
no larger than our solar system.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.110
Observable universes like
those are simply much more

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:25.730
plenteous in the world
ensemble than finely tuned

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:30.220
worlds like ours and therefore
ought to be observed by us.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.726
Since we do not have such observations

00:24:32.726 --> 00:24:37.726
that fact strongly dis-confirms
the multiverse hypothesis.

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:40.910
On atheism, at least, then it is highly

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:45.069
probable that there is no world ensemble.

00:24:45.069 --> 00:24:48.070
The fine tuning of the
universe is therefore

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:52.080
plausibly due neither to
physical necessity nor to chance.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.380
It therefore follows logically that

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.400
the best explanation is design.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.540
Thus the teleological argument gives

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.373
us an intelligent designer of the cosmos.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.923
Three, the moral argument.

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:11.590
If God does not exist then objective moral

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:13.866
values do not exist.

00:25:13.866 --> 00:25:17.340
By objective moral values
I mean moral values

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.900
which are valid and
binding whether we believe

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.420
in them or not.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.010
Many theists and atheists
agree that if God

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:27.150
does not exist then moral values are not

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:29.670
objective in this way.

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:33.617
Michael Ruse, a noted
philosopher of science, explains,

00:25:33.617 --> 00:25:35.737
"The position of the modern evolutionist

00:25:35.737 --> 00:25:39.197
"is that morality is a
biological adaptation,

00:25:39.197 --> 00:25:42.227
"no less than our hands
and feet and teeth.

00:25:42.227 --> 00:25:44.637
"Considered as a
rationally justifiable set

00:25:44.637 --> 00:25:49.467
"of claims about an objective
something, ethics is illusory.

00:25:49.467 --> 00:25:51.892
"I appreciate that when someone says,

00:25:51.892 --> 00:25:54.277
"'love thy neighbor as thyself,'

00:25:54.277 --> 00:25:57.607
"they think they are referring
above and beyond themselves.

00:25:57.607 --> 00:26:01.337
"Nevertheless, such reference
is truly without foundation.

00:26:01.337 --> 00:26:05.087
"Morality is just an aid to survival

00:26:05.087 --> 00:26:10.087
"and reproduction and any
deeper meaning is illusory."

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.410
Like Professor Ruse I just don't see

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:17.560
any reason to think that
in the absence of God,

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.650
the morality which has emerged among these

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:25.240
imperfectly evolved primates
we call Homo sapiens is

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:29.710
objective, and here Mr.
Hitchens seems to agree with me.

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:34.460
He says moral values are
just innate predispositions,

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.240
ingrained into us by evolution.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.890
Such predispositions,
he says, are inevitable

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:44.070
for any animal endowed
with social instincts.

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.810
On the atheistic view
then an action like rape

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:51.280
is not socially advantageous and so in

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:54.720
the course of human
development has become taboo,

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.160
but that does absolutely
nothing to prove that rape is

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.510
really morally wrong.

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:02.720
On the atheistic view
there's nothing really

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.343
wrong with raping someone.

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.800
But the problem is that
objective values do exist

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.900
and deep down we all know it.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.400
In moral experience we apprehend

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.880
a realm of objective
moral goods and evils.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.130
Actions like rape,
cruelty, and child abuse

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:23.450
aren't just socially
unacceptable behavior,

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:25.330
they're moral abominations.

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.140
Some things, at least, are really wrong.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.020
Similarly love, equality,
and self-sacrifice

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.750
are really good.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:36.320
But then it follows
logically and necessarily

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.053
that God exists.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:42.970
Number four, the resurrection of Jesus.

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:45.680
The historical person Jesus of Nazareth

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.100
was a remarkable individual.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.560
Historians have reached
something of a consensus

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.650
that the historical Jesus
came on the scene with an

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:56.500
unprecedented sense of divine authority,

00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:00.870
the authority to stand
and speak in God's place.

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:03.170
He claimed that in
Himself the Kingdom of God

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:05.910
had come and as visible
demonstrations of this

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:08.900
fact He carried out a
ministry of miracle working

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:10.890
and exorcisms.

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:12.510
But the supreme confirmation of

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:15.570
His claim was His
resurrection from the dead.

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:18.350
If Jesus did rise from the dead than

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:20.810
it would seem that we
have a divine miracle

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:25.440
on our hands and thus evidence
for the existence of God.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:28.180
Now most people probably
think that the resurrection of

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:32.070
Jesus is something you just
believe in, by faith or not.

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:34.520
But there are actually
three established facts

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.940
recognized by the
majority of New Testament

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:40.660
historians today which I
believe are best explained

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.770
by the resurrection of Jesus.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:46.550
Fact number one: on the
Sunday after His crucifixion,

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:50.260
Jesus' tomb was discovered
empty by a group

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.000
of His women followers.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.170
According to Jakob Kremer,
an Austrian specialist,

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:59.740
by far most scholars hold
firmly to the reliability

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:03.550
of the biblical statements
about the empty tomb.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:07.430
Fact number two: on separate
occasions different individuals

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:10.730
in groups experienced appearances of Jesus

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:12.870
alive after his death.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:14.590
According to the prominent New Testament

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:18.140
critic Gerd Lüdemann, it
may be taken as historically

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:21.567
certain that the disciples
had experiences after Jesus'

00:29:21.567 --> 00:29:26.567
death in which Jesus appeared
to them as the risen Christ.

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:30.720
These appearances were
witnessed not only by believers

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:35.720
but also by unbelievers,
skeptics, and even enemies.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.750
Fact number three: the
original disciples suddenly

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:42.350
came to believe in the
resurrection of Jesus

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:45.790
despite having every
predisposition to the contrary.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:50.720
Jews had no belief in a dying,
much less rising Messiah.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.527
And Jewish beliefs about the
afterlife prohibited anyone's

00:29:53.527 --> 00:29:56.700
rising from the dead
before the resurrection

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.280
at the end of the world.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:01.830
Nevertheless the original
disciples came to believe so

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:05.180
strongly that God had
raised Jesus from the dead

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:08.050
that they were willing
to die for the truth of

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:09.340
that belief.

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:11.240
N.T. Wright, an eminent New Testament

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.967
scholar concludes, "That
is why as a historian

00:30:14.967 --> 00:30:18.107
"I cannot explain the
rise of early Christianity

00:30:18.107 --> 00:30:23.107
"unless Jesus rose again leaving
an empty tomb behind him."

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.620
Attempts to explain away
these three great facts

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:28.920
like the disciples stole the
body or Jesus wasn't really

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.570
dead have been universally rejected by

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:33.510
contemporary scholarship.

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:36.800
The simple fact is that
there just is no plausible,

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:40.490
naturalistic explanation of these facts.

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:42.240
And therefore it seems to me the Christian

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.310
is amply justified in believing that Jesus

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:49.030
rose from the dead and
was who he claimed to be.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:52.023
But that entails that God exists.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:57.353
Finally, number five, the
immediate experience of God.

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:00.960
This isn't really an
argument for God's existence,

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.060
rather it's the claim
that you can know that

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.010
God exists wholly apart from argument,

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:08.280
simply by immediately experiencing him.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.207
Philosophers call beliefs like these

00:31:10.207 --> 00:31:12.530
"properly basic beliefs."

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:14.670
They aren't based on other beliefs rather

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:16.860
they're part of the
foundation of a person's

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:18.340
system of beliefs.

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.660
Other properly basic
beliefs include the belief

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:24.018
in the reality of the external world,

00:31:24.018 --> 00:31:26.800
the belief in the existence of the past

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.780
and the presence of other
minds like your own.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:33.290
When you think about it none
of these beliefs can be proved.

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:35.520
But, although these sorts of beliefs

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.910
are basic for us that doesn't
mean they're arbitrary.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:40.670
Rather they're grounded in the sense

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:44.200
that they're formed in the
context of certain experiences.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.560
In the experiential context of seeing

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.180
and hearing and feeling things I naturally

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:52.460
form the belief in a
world of physical objects.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:55.030
And thus my beliefs are not arbitrary

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.620
but appropriately grounded in experience.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:00.900
They're not merely basic
but properly basic.

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.870
In the same way, belief in God is,

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:07.750
for those who know him,
a properly basic belief

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:11.410
grounded in our experience of God.

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:14.130
Now, if this is right
there's a danger that

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:16.500
arguments for God's
existence could actually

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.720
distract your attention from God himself.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.610
If you're sincerely seeking God then

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:25.620
God will make his
existence evident to you.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:28.619
We mustn't so concentrate
on the external arguments

00:32:28.619 --> 00:32:31.610
that we fail to hear
the inner voice of God

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:33.560
speaking to our own hearts.

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:35.760
For those who listen, God becomes

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.310
an immediate reality in their lives.

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:42.329
So, in conclusion then we've seen five

00:32:42.329 --> 00:32:45.860
good arguments to think that God exists.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.530
If Mr. Hitchens wants us
to believe instead that

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:52.360
God does not exist, then
he must first tear down

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:55.650
all five of the arguments
that I presented and

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:58.320
then in their place
erect a case of his own

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.830
to prove that God does not exist.

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:05.090
Unless and until he does
that I think that theism

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:07.303
is the more plausible world view.

00:33:09.144 --> 00:33:12.144
[audience applause]

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:28.823
&gt;&gt; Well, am I audible?

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:31.360
Am I audible to all?

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.440
Yes.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.430
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
brothers and sisters,

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:38.480
comrades, friends, thanks for coming out,

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.900
at Senator Larry Craig actually did say

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:45.690
at his press conference.
[audience laughing]

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:49.770
Thank you, Mr. Hewitt
and Dr. Craig for being

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:52.410
among the very many,
very, very many Christians

00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:55.760
who have so generously and hospitably

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.281
and warmly taken me up on the challenge

00:33:58.281 --> 00:34:01.120
I issued when I started
my little book tour

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:04.520
and welcomed me to your
places to have this

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.600
most important of all discussions.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.163
I can't express my gratitude enough.

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:14.950
And thanks to the very nice young ladies

00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:18.430
who I ran into at The
Elephant Bar this afternoon

00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:19.970
where I hadn't expected a posse of

00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:23.597
Biola students to be on
staff, but where I thought,

00:34:23.597 --> 00:34:27.627
"God, they're everywhere now."
[audience laughing]

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:33.200
Now, what I have discovered
in voyaging around

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.390
this country and others in this debate

00:34:35.390 --> 00:34:39.390
and debating with Hindus,
with Muslims, with Jews,

00:34:39.390 --> 00:34:40.890
with Christians of all stripes,

00:34:40.890 --> 00:34:43.560
is that the arguments are all essentially

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.230
the same for belief in the supernatural,

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:49.160
for belief in faith, for belief in God,

00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.120
but that there are very interesting

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.620
and noteworthy discrepancies between them.

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.700
And one that I want to call attention

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.810
to at the beginning of this evening

00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:00.970
is between those like
my friend Doug Wilson

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:02.960
with whom I've now done a book of argument

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.480
about Christian apologetics,

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.490
who would call himself
a presuppositionalist,

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:08.040
in other words, for whom really

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.230
it's only necessary to
discover the workings

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:14.790
of God's will in the cosmos and to assume

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:18.640
that the truth of
Christianity is already proven

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.230
and what are called,
they include Dr. Craig

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:25.750
with great honor and respect
in this, the evidentialists.

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:29.070
Now, I want to begin by
saying that this distinction

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:31.890
strikes me first as a
very charming distinction

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:35.220
and second as false, or
perhaps as a distinction

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.600
without a difference.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.620
Well, why do I say charming?

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:40.090
Because I think it's
rather sweet that people

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:41.830
of faith also think
they ought to have some

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:44.473
evidence and I think
it's progress of a kind.

00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:48.900
After all, if we had been
having this debate in the

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.760
mid-19th century, Professor Craig or his

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.440
equivalent would have
known little or probably

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.330
nothing about the laws
of physics and biology,

00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:59.360
maybe even less than I know now, which is,

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:02.933
to say, quite a lot in it's way.

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:05.920
And they would have grounded themselves,

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.650
or he would have grounded
himself, on faith,

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:12.230
on Scripture, on
revelation, on the prospect

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:14.370
of salvation, on the means of grace,

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:18.530
and the hope of glory
and perhaps on Paley's

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:20.350
natural theology.

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:22.200
Paley, who had the same
rooms, or had had the

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.660
same rooms later occupied
by Charles Darwin

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:27.040
in Cambridge with its watchmaker theory

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:29.660
of design that I know
I don't have to expound

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.740
to you but which briefly suggests that

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.010
if an aborigine is walking along a beach

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:38.130
and finds a gold watch
ticking he knows not

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:40.510
what it's for or where it came from

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:42.510
or who made it but he
knows it's not a rock,

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:43.940
he knows it's not a vegetable, he knows it

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:45.650
must have had a designer.

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:48.062
The Paley analogy held for most Christians

00:36:48.062 --> 00:36:50.837
for many years because
they were willing to make

00:36:50.837 --> 00:36:53.910
the assumption that we
were mechanisms and that,

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:56.680
therefore, there must be a watchmaker.

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:59.391
But now that it's been, here's where the

00:36:59.391 --> 00:37:02.490
presuppositionalist-versus-evidentialist
dichotomy

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:05.498
begins to kick in-now it's
been rather painstakingly

00:37:05.498 --> 00:37:09.230
and elaborately demonstrated
to the satisfaction

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:11.670
of most people, I don't
want to just use arguments

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:15.630
from authority, but it's not
very much contested any more,

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:18.780
that we are not designed as creatures,

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:22.910
but that we evolved by a
rather laborious combination

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:25.680
of random mutation and natural selection

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.563
into the species that we are today.

00:37:29.469 --> 00:37:31.130
It is, of course, open to the faithful

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:35.060
to say that all this was, now
that they come to know it,

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:37.330
now that it becomes
available to everybody,

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:39.300
now that they think about it,

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:43.330
and now that they've stopped
opposing it or trying ban it,

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:46.237
then they can say, "Ah,
actually, on second thought

00:37:46.237 --> 00:37:49.010
"the evolution was all
part of the design."

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:51.060
Well, as you will recognize,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.830
there are some arguments
I can't be expected

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:55.860
to refute or rebut because there's no way

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:56.980
around that argument.

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.290
I mean, if everything,
including evolution,

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:02.260
which isn't a design, is nonetheless part

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.320
of a divine design than all the advantage

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.130
goes to the person who's
willing to believe that.

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:08.770
That cannot be disproved
but it does seem to

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:10.780
be a very poor, very weak argument because

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:13.360
the test of a good argument is that it is

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:16.190
falsifiable not that it's unfalsifiable.

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:19.700
So this I would therefore, this tactic,

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:22.230
or this style of argument, which we've had

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:24.607
some evidence of this
evening, I would rebaptize

00:38:24.607 --> 00:38:27.140
or when I dare say rechristen

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:30.450
it as retrospective evidentialism.

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:31.900
In other words everything can,

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:36.030
in due time, if you have
enough faith, be made to fit.

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:38.621
And you too are all quite free to believe

00:38:38.621 --> 00:38:42.290
that a sentient creator deliberately,

00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:44.420
consciously put himself, a being,

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.670
put himself or herself
or itself to the trouble

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:50.989
of going through huge epochs of birth

00:38:50.989 --> 00:38:55.989
and death of species over
eons of time in which 99%,

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:02.500
in the course of which at
least 99.9% of all species,

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:05.905
all life forms, ever to
have appeared on earth have

00:39:05.905 --> 00:39:10.310
become extinct, as we nearly
did as a species ourselves.

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:12.870
I invite you to look up the
very alarming and beautiful

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:16.240
and brilliant account by
the National Geographic's

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.100
coordinator of the genome project.

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.470
By the way you should
send in your little sample

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:22.670
from the inside of you cheek and have your

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:24.010
African ancestry traced.

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:26.350
It's absolutely fascinating to follow

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:28.970
the mitochondrial DNA
that we all have in common

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:31.110
and that we have in
common with other species,

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:33.260
other primates, and other life forms

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:34.910
and find out where in
Africa you came from.

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:37.600
But there came a time, probably about

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:41.130
180,000 years ago, when, due to a terrible

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:43.790
climatic event, probably in Indonesia,

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:46.610
an appalling global
warming crisis occurred

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:48.790
and the estimate is that
the number of humans

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:51.923
in Africa went down to
between 40 and 30,000.

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:56.450
This close, this close,
think about fine tuning.

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:58.460
This close to joining every other species

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.130
that had gone extinct.

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:02.250
And that's our Exodus
story is that somehow

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:04.400
we don't know how because it's
not written in any Scripture,

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.060
it's not told in any book, it's not part

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.530
of any superstitious narrative
but somehow we escaped

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:11.280
from Africa to cooler latitudes was made,

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.250
but that's how close it was.

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:14.135
You have to be able to
imagine that all this

00:40:14.135 --> 00:40:17.460
mass extinction and death and randomness

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.146
is the will of a being.

00:40:19.146 --> 00:40:24.146
You are absolutely free to
believe that if you wish.

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:27.040
And all of this should happen so that

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.980
one very imperfect race
of evolved primates

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:32.820
should have the opportunity
to become Christians

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.935
or to turn up at this
gym tonight, that all of

00:40:35.935 --> 00:40:38.780
that was done with us in view.

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:41.590
It's a curious kind of solipsism,

00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:43.270
it's a curious kind of self-centeredness.

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:44.420
I was always brought up to believe that

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:46.750
Christians were modest and humble,

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:49.400
they comported themselves
with due humility.

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.010
This, there's a certain arrogance to this

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:53.486
assumption all of this,
all of this extraordinary

00:40:53.486 --> 00:40:57.020
development was all about us and we were

00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:58.560
the intended and the desired result

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.640
and everything else was in the discard.

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.490
The tremendous wastefulness of it,

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:06.190
the tremendous cruelty of it,
the tremendous caprice of it,

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:08.420
the tremendous tinkering
and incompetence of it,

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:11.330
never mind at least we're here and we can

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:12.570
be people of faith.

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:15.120
It doesn't work me, I
have to simply say that

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:17.320
and I think there may be
questions of psychology

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.663
involved in this as well.

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:23.740
Believe it if you can, I can't stop you.

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.690
Believe it if you like, you're welcome.

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:27.540
It's obviously impossible,
as I said before,

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:30.300
to disprove and it equally
obviously helps you

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:33.010
to believe it if, as we all are,

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:34.890
you're in the happy position
of knowing the outcome,

00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:36.880
in other words we are here.

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:39.410
But there's a fallacy lurking
in there somewhere too,

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:41.120
is there not?

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.170
Now it's often said, it was said tonight,

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:45.823
and Dr. Craig said it in print,

00:41:45.823 --> 00:41:49.790
that atheists think they can
prove the nonexistence of God.

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:52.688
This, in fact, very slightly
but crucially misrepresents

00:41:52.688 --> 00:41:55.000
what we've always said.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.550
There's nothing new
about the New Atheists,

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:59.060
it's just we're recent,
there's nothing particularly,

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:01.770
Dr. Victor Stenger, a great scientist,

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:04.550
has written a book called
The Failed Hypothesis,

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:06.080
which he says he thinks that science

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:11.080
can now license the claim that
there definitely is no God,

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.040
but he's unique in that, and I think

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.170
very bold and courageous.

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:15.243
Here's what we argue.

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:18.380
We argue quite simply

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:21.670
that there's no plausible
or convincing reason,

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:24.017
certainly no evidential one, to believe

00:42:24.017 --> 00:42:26.980
that there is such an entity, and that all

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.120
observable phenomena,
including the cosmological

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.710
one to which I'm coming, are explicable

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:33.830
without the hypothesis.

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:35.330
You don't need the assumption.

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.270
And this objection
itself, our school falls

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:42.170
into at least two, perhaps three sections.

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:44.160
There's no such thing, no such word though

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:48.260
there should be, as "adeism"
or as being an "adeist"

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:51.060
but there if was one I
would say that's what I was.

00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:53.630
I don't believe that we
are here as the result

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:55.940
of a design or that by making the

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:58.010
appropriate propitiations and adopting

00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:00.370
the appropriate postures and following

00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:02.600
the appropriate rituals we can overcome

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.820
death I don't believe that and for

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.740
a priori of reasons don't.

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.060
If there was such a force,

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:13.830
which I cannot prove by
definition that there was not,

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:15.800
if there was an entity
that was responsible

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.930
for the beginning of the cosmos, and that

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:20.730
also happened to be busily engineering

00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:23.040
the very laborious product,
production of life on

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.110
our little planet, it
still wouldn't prove that

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:31.110
this entity cared about
us, answered prayers,

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:33.500
cared what church we went to, or whether

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.630
we went to one at all,
cared who we had sex

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:37.950
with or in what position or by what means,

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:40.420
cared what we ate or on what day,

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:41.690
cared whether we lived or died.

00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:43.140
There's no reason at all why this

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:45.253
entity isn't completely indifferent to us.

00:43:45.253 --> 00:43:48.930
That you cannot get from deism to theism

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:52.360
except by a series of
extraordinarily generous,

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:54.640
to yourself, assumptions.

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:57.270
The deist has all his work still ahead of

00:43:57.270 --> 00:44:00.210
him to show that it leads to revelation,

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:03.760
to redemption, to
salvation or to suspensions

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.170
of the natural order in which hitherto

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:06.880
you'd be putting all of your faith,

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:10.852
all your evidence is on scientific
and natural evidence or,

00:44:10.852 --> 00:44:12.990
why not, for a change of pace for a change

00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:14.927
of taste say, "Yes, but sometimes this

00:44:14.927 --> 00:44:18.757
"same natural order, which is
so miraculous in observation,

00:44:18.757 --> 00:44:22.367
"no question about it, is so
impressive in its favoring

00:44:22.367 --> 00:44:24.707
"the conditions for life in some ways,

00:44:24.707 --> 00:44:28.440
"but its randomly suspended
when miracles are required."

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:31.010
So with caprice and
contempt these laws turn

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:33.510
out to be not so important after all

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:34.620
as long as the truth of religion

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:36.950
can be proved by their
being rendered inoperative.

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:38.186
This is having it both ways

00:44:38.186 --> 00:44:41.290
in the most promiscuous
and exorbitant manner,

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:43.153
in my submission.

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:46.610
Bear in mind also that these are not

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:49.300
precisely the differences,
between Dr. Craig

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:51.410
and myself I mean,
morally or intellectually

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:52.243
equivalent claims.

00:44:52.243 --> 00:44:55.130
After all, Dr. Craig,
to win this argument,

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:58.460
has to believe and prove to certainty.

00:44:58.460 --> 00:44:59.840
He's not just saying there might be a

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:02.650
God because he has to say that there must

00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:04.018
be one otherwise we couldn't be here

00:45:04.018 --> 00:45:06.210
and there couldn't be morality.

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:08.490
It's not a contingency for him.

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:12.690
I have to say that I appear as a skeptic

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:16.010
who believes that doubt
is the great engine,

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:19.950
the great fuel of all
inquiry, all discovery,

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:23.600
and all innovation and
that I doubt these things.

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.528
The disadvantage, it seems to me,

00:45:25.528 --> 00:45:27.387
in the argument goes
to the person who says,

00:45:27.387 --> 00:45:30.750
"No, I know, I know it it
must be true, it is true."

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:33.290
We're too early in the study
of physics and biology,

00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:35.240
it seems to me, to be
dealing in certainties

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.370
of that kind especially
when the stakes are so high.

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:40.060
It seems to me, to put
it in a condensed form,

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:42.014
extraordinary claims,
such as the existence

00:45:42.014 --> 00:45:45.930
of a divine power with
a son who cares enough

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:47.680
to come and redeem us, extraordinary

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:50.120
claims require truly
extraordinary evidence.

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.840
I don't think any of the
evidence we heard from Dr. Craig,

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.730
brilliantly marshaled as it was,

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:58.960
was extraordinary enough
to justify the extreme

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:01.813
claims that are being made, backed by it.

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:05.777
"Hypocrisy," said La Rochefoucauld,

00:46:05.777 --> 00:46:08.397
"Is the compliment that
vice pays to virtue."

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.470
Retrospective evidentialism strikes me

00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:13.060
in something of the same sort of light.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:18.060
It's a concession made
to the need for fact.

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:21.540
Maybe we better have some
evidence to along with our faith.

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:24.360
But look what Dr. Craig says in his book.

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.647
He says, I'll quote directly, he says,

00:46:26.647 --> 00:46:29.687
"Should a conflict arise between

00:46:29.687 --> 00:46:31.347
"the witness of the Holy Spirit to

00:46:31.347 --> 00:46:33.727
"the fundamental truth
of the Christian faith

00:46:33.727 --> 00:46:36.357
"and beliefs based on
argument and evidence

00:46:36.357 --> 00:46:38.357
"then it is the former
which must take precedence

00:46:38.357 --> 00:46:39.930
"over the latter."

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:42.500
He adds not vice-versa
but a good editor would've

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:45.180
told you you don't have
to put the vice-versa in,

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:46.450
it's clear enough as it is.

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:48.597
I'll say it again,
"Should a conflict arise

00:46:48.597 --> 00:46:50.347
"between the witness of the Holy Spirit

00:46:50.347 --> 00:46:52.457
"to the fundamental truth
of the Christian faith

00:46:52.457 --> 00:46:54.097
"and beliefs based on
argument and evidence

00:46:54.097 --> 00:46:55.947
"then it is the former which must take

00:46:55.947 --> 00:46:57.490
"precedence over the latter."

00:46:57.490 --> 00:47:01.170
That's not evidentialism,
that's just faith.

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:03.293
It's a priori belief.

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:07.230
It's rephrased in another edition.

00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:08.597
It says, "Therefore the role of rational

00:47:08.597 --> 00:47:11.267
"argumentation in knowing Christianity

00:47:11.267 --> 00:47:13.747
"to be true is the role of a servant.

00:47:13.747 --> 00:47:15.387
"A person knows Christianity is true

00:47:15.387 --> 00:47:18.557
"because the Holy Spirit
tells him it is true.

00:47:18.557 --> 00:47:20.057
"And while argument and evidence can be

00:47:20.057 --> 00:47:21.177
"used to support this conclusion

00:47:21.177 --> 00:47:23.387
"they cannot legitimately overrule it."

00:47:25.210 --> 00:47:27.910
Now, then he goes on to say the Bible says

00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:28.987
all men are without excuse.

00:47:28.987 --> 00:47:31.647
"Even those who are given
no reason to believe,

00:47:31.647 --> 00:47:33.307
"and many persuasive
reasons to disbelieve,

00:47:33.307 --> 00:47:35.677
"have no excuse but
because the ultimate reason

00:47:35.677 --> 00:47:37.207
"they do not believe is that they have

00:47:37.207 --> 00:47:39.070
"deliberately rejected God's Holy Spirit."

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:40.670
That would have to be me.

00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:42.650
But you see where this lands
you, ladies and gentlemen,

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:44.730
with the Christian apologetic.

00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:46.520
You're told you're a miserable sinner,

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:48.860
who is without excuse;

00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:51.541
you've disappointed your God who made you

00:47:51.541 --> 00:47:54.700
and you've been so ungrateful as to rebel;

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:56.627
you're contemptible; you're worm-like;

00:47:56.627 --> 00:47:59.240
but you can take heart, the whole universe

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:00.990
was designed with just you in mind.

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:05.350
These two claims are not
just mutually exclusive

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:07.100
but I think they're intended to compensate

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:10.653
each other's cruelty and,
ultimately, absurdity.

00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:14.807
In other words, evidence is
an occasional convenience.

00:48:14.807 --> 00:48:15.640
"Seek and ye shall find."

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.670
I remember being told that in church

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:19.437
many a time as a young lad.

00:48:19.437 --> 00:48:20.370
"Seek and ye shall find."

00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:22.500
I thought it was a sinister injunction

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.060
because it's all too likely to be true.

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:26.900
We are pattern-seeking
mammals and primates.

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:30.440
If we can't get good evidence
we'll go for junk evidence.

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.730
If we can't get a real theory

00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:33.270
we'll go with a conspiracy theory.

00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:34.610
You see it all the time.

00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:36.651
Religion's great strength
is that it was the first

00:48:36.651 --> 00:48:39.470
of our attempts to explain reality,

00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:41.910
to make those patterns
take some kind of form.

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:42.770
It deserves credit.

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:44.860
It was our first attempt at astronomy;

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:46.250
our first attempt at cosmology;

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:48.520
in some ways our first
attempt at medicine;

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.220
our first attempt at literature;

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:51.730
our first attempt at philosophy.

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:54.410
Good, while there was nothing else,

00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:57.160
it had many functional uses of mankind.

00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:58.920
Never mind that they didn't know

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.950
that germs caused disease,
maybe evil spirits

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:03.640
caused disease, maybe
disease is a punishment;

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.900
never mind that they believed in astrology

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.390
rather than astronomy.

00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:09.330
Even Thomas Aquinas believed in astrology.

00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:11.630
Never mind that they believed in devils;

00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:14.690
never mind that things
like volcanic eruptions,

00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:17.610
earthquakes, tidal waves were
thought of as punishments,

00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:22.523
not as natural occurrences on
the cooling crust of a planet.

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:27.500
The pattern seeking has gone too far

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:32.810
and it's gone, I think, much too far with

00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:34.500
what was until recently thought of as

00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:37.950
Christianity's greatest failure,
greatest of all failures:

00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:39.770
cosmology, the one thing Christianity

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:41.750
knew nothing about and taught the

00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:43.223
most abject nonsense about.

00:49:44.176 --> 00:49:45.740
For most of its lifetime Christianity

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:47.810
taught that the earth
itself was the center

00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:50.150
of the universe and we had been given

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:52.550
exclusive dominion as a species over it.

00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:54.590
Could not have been more wrong.

00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:56.570
How are we going to
square the new cosmology,

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:58.760
the fantastic new discoveries in physics

00:49:58.760 --> 00:49:59.970
with the old dogmas?

00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:02.888
Well, one is the idea of this fine tuning

00:50:02.888 --> 00:50:06.350
about which I've only left
myself three and a half minutes.

00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:09.343
I'll have to refer some of this
to later in the discussion.

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:13.380
This is essentially another
form of pattern seeking

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:16.070
on the basis of extremely
limited evidence.

00:50:16.070 --> 00:50:19.170
Most physicists are very uncertain,

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:20.950
as they have every right to be.

00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:23.380
In fact, I would say for physicists

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:25.750
as they have the duty
to be, at the moment,

00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:28.930
extremely uncertain
about the spatio-temporal

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:31.070
dimensions of the original episode,

00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:32.895
the Big Bang at it's sometimes called.

00:50:32.895 --> 00:50:35.073
We're in the very, very early stages

00:50:35.073 --> 00:50:36.080
of this inquiry.

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:39.180
We hardly know what we
don't know about the origins

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:40.013
of the universe.

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:43.550
We're viewing it from an
unimaginable distance,

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:46.220
not just an unimaginable
distance in space,

00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:47.892
perched on a tiny rock on an extremely

00:50:47.892 --> 00:50:51.470
small suburb of a fairly minor galaxy,

00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:53.740
trying to look, to discern our origins,

00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:56.040
but also at a very unbelievable distance

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.817
in time and we claim the right to say,

00:50:57.817 --> 00:51:01.180
"Ah, we can see the finger
of God in this process."

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:04.570
It's an extraordinarily
arrogant assumption.

00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:06.980
It either deserves a
Nobel Prize in physics,

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:08.970
which it hasn't yet got, I notice.

00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:10.450
I don't know any physicists who believes

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:12.390
these assumptions are necessary.

00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:16.469
Or it deserves a charge of hubris.

00:51:16.469 --> 00:51:19.290
Let me make three tiny quick objections to

00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:21.430
it as it stands, and
I'm no more a physicist

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:22.493
than most of you are.

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:24.920
I'll make these lay objections.

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:28.170
One, was there pre-existing material

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:31.713
for this extra-spatio-temporal
being to work with,

00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:36.540
or did he just will it into
existence, the ex nihilo?

00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:38.630
Who designed the designer?

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:40.960
Don't you run the risk
with the presumption

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.977
of a god and a designer and
an originator of asking,

00:51:43.977 --> 00:51:45.727
"Well, where does that come from,

00:51:45.727 --> 00:51:46.780
"where does that come from,"

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:50.040
and locking yourself
into an infinite regress?

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:52.730
Why are there so many shooting stars,

00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:55.900
collapsed suns, failed
galaxies we can see?

00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:57.190
We can see with the aid of a telescope,

00:51:57.190 --> 00:52:00.650
some we can see with the
naked eye the utter failure,

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:03.910
the total destruction
of gigantic unimaginable

00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:05.940
sweeps of outer space.

00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:09.400
Is this fine tuning, or
is it extremely random,

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:13.543
capricious, cruel,
mysterious, and incompetent?

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:20.170
And, have you thought of the
nothingness that's coming?

00:52:20.290 --> 00:52:22.650
We know we have something now,

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:25.410
and we speculate about what
it might have come from

00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:26.650
and there's a real question about

00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:30.780
ex nihilo, but nihilo is coming to us.

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:32.070
In the night sky you can already see

00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:33.730
the Andromeda galaxy,
it's heading straight

00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:35.340
for ours on a collision course.

00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:36.600
Is that part of a design?

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:38.683
Was it fine tuned to do that?

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:41.880
We know that from the red light shift

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:43.150
of the Hubble telescope, or rather

00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:44.930
Edwin Hubble's original discovery,

00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:46.970
the universe is expanding away from itself

00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:48.650
at a tremendous rate.

00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:49.850
It was thought that rate would go

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:52.000
down for Newtonian reasons.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.770
No, it's recently been proved
by Professor Lawrence Krauss

00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:57.070
the rate of expansion is increasing.

00:52:57.070 --> 00:53:00.110
Everything's exploding away even faster.

00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:01.730
Nothingness is certainly coming.

00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:04.183
Who designed that?

00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:08.730
That's all if before these things happen

00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:11.010
we don't have the destruction of our own

00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:14.230
little solar system in which already

00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:15.800
there's only one planet where anything

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.440
like life can possibly be supported.

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:20.770
All the other planets
are too hot or too cold

00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:23.190
to support any life at
all and the sun is due

00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:26.700
to swell up, burn us to
a crisp, boil our oceans,

00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:28.720
and die as we've seen all the other suns

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:30.040
do in the night sky.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.850
This is not fine tuning,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:53:31.850 --> 00:53:33.782
and if it's the work of a designer,

00:53:33.782 --> 00:53:35.990
then there's an indictment to which

00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:38.720
that designer may have to be subjected.

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.120
I'm out of time, I'm very grateful

00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:41.564
for your kindness and hospitality.

00:53:41.564 --> 00:53:46.564
Thank you.
[audience applause]

00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:59.427
&gt;&gt; Dr. Craig, a 12 minute rebuttal.

00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:12.950
&gt;&gt; You'll remember that
in my opening speech,

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:15.560
I said I would defend
two basic contentions

00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:17.240
in tonight's debate.

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:21.160
First, that there's no good
argument that atheism is true.

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:24.210
Now, far from being a point
of contention tonight,

00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:27.120
as far as I understood
Mr. Hitchens' last speech,

00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:29.270
he would agree with that first statement

00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:32.680
that there is no good
argument that atheism is true.

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:35.657
He says, "I simply don't
have any positive reason

00:54:35.657 --> 00:54:37.390
"to believe in God."

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:39.950
But he doesn't really
give an argument against

00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:40.783
God's existence.

00:54:40.783 --> 00:54:43.560
Indeed, he seems to
suggest that's impossible.

00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:45.540
But notice that doesn't prove atheism.

00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:48.120
That just leaves you
with agnosticism, mainly,

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:51.600
you don't know if there's
a God or no, so, at best,

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:53.770
you're left merely with agnosticism.

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:56.090
We don't see any good reason to think that

00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:57.670
atheism is true.

00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:00.660
Now he did makes some remarks
about the theory of evolution

00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:03.570
which at least insinuated
that this was somehow

00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:05.740
incompatible with theism, and I have

00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:07.140
two points to make about this.

00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:09.250
First, I think that the
theory of biological

00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:12.160
evolution is simply
irrelevant to the truth

00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:13.920
of Christian theism.

00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:16.380
Genesis, one, admits
all manner of different

00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:18.910
interpretations and one is by no means

00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:21.430
committed to six-day creationism.

00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:23.400
Howard van Till, who is a professor

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:26.487
at Calvin College,
writes, "Is the concept of

00:55:26.487 --> 00:55:29.257
"special creation required of all persons

00:55:29.257 --> 00:55:31.787
"who trust in the
creator God of Scripture?

00:55:31.787 --> 00:55:33.357
"Most Christians in my acquaintance

00:55:33.357 --> 00:55:35.177
"who are engaged with either scientific

00:55:35.177 --> 00:55:37.557
"or biblical scholarship have concluded

00:55:37.557 --> 00:55:39.397
"that the special creationists' picture of

00:55:39.397 --> 00:55:42.937
"the world's formation is
not a necessary component

00:55:42.937 --> 00:55:45.877
"of Christian belief,
nor is this a retreat

00:55:45.877 --> 00:55:47.980
"caused by modern science."

00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:50.300
Saint Augustin in the AD 300s,

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:52.396
in his commentary on Genesis,

00:55:52.396 --> 00:55:54.850
pointed out that the days
don't need to be taken

00:55:54.850 --> 00:55:59.080
literally nor need the creation
be a few thousand years ago.

00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:00.956
Indeed he suggested
that God made the world

00:56:00.956 --> 00:56:03.140
with certain special potencies that would

00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:06.377
gradually unfold over time and develop.

00:56:06.377 --> 00:56:11.270
This interpretation came 1500 years before

00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:15.320
Darwin so that it is not a forced retreat

00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:17.400
in the face of modern science.

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:19.370
So any doubts that I would have about

00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:21.480
the theory of biological evolution would

00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:25.390
be not biblical but rather scientific,

00:56:25.390 --> 00:56:30.260
namely, what it imagines is
fantastically improbable.

00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:32.264
Barrow and Tipler, two
physicists in their book

00:56:32.264 --> 00:56:35.510
The Anthropic Cosmological Principle

00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:39.033
list ten steps in the
course of human evolution,

00:56:39.033 --> 00:56:41.805
each of which is so improbable that before

00:56:41.805 --> 00:56:44.660
it would occur the sun would have ceased

00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:48.950
to be a main sequence star
and incinerated the earth.

00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:52.115
And they calculate the
probability of the evolution

00:56:52.115 --> 00:56:54.910
of the human genome to
be somewhere between

00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:59.910
four to the negative 180th
power to the 110,000th power

00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:06.490
and four to the negative 360th
power to the 110,000th power.

00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:10.190
So, if evolution did occur on this planet

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:13.040
it was literally a miracle,
and therefore evidence

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:16.720
for the existence of God.
[audience applause]

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:20.030
So I don't think this is
an argument for atheism,

00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:22.022
quite the contrary, it
really provides good grounds

00:57:22.022 --> 00:57:24.350
for thinking that God superintended

00:57:24.350 --> 00:57:26.790
the process of biological development.

00:57:26.790 --> 00:57:29.280
So the Christian can
be open to the evidence

00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:31.240
to follow it where it leads.

00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:34.147
By contrast, as Alvin Plantinga has said,

00:57:34.147 --> 00:57:37.687
"For the naturalist, evolution
is the only game in town.

00:57:37.687 --> 00:57:41.147
"No matter how fantastic the
odds, no matter how improbable,

00:57:41.147 --> 00:57:43.427
"it's got to be true because there is

00:57:43.427 --> 00:57:45.810
"no intelligent creator and designer."

00:57:45.810 --> 00:57:48.060
So in one sense you've
got to feel a little sorry

00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:48.893
for the atheist.

00:57:48.893 --> 00:57:51.920
He can't really follow the
evidence where it leads,

00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:54.830
his presuppositions determine the outcome.

00:57:54.830 --> 00:57:58.650
By contrast, if there is
a fine tuner and creator

00:57:58.650 --> 00:58:01.210
of the universe then
already in the initial

00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:04.880
conditions of the Big Bang you
have an elaborately designed

00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:07.420
universe that permits the
evolution and existence of

00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:10.364
intelligent life and I think
evolution simply layers

00:58:10.364 --> 00:58:12.710
on more improbability.

00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:16.437
Now Mr. Hitchens says, "But
why did God wait so long,

00:58:16.437 --> 00:58:19.787
"all that waste during this time?"

00:58:19.787 --> 00:58:22.461
Well, that sort of concern with efficiency

00:58:22.461 --> 00:58:26.470
is only of importance
to someone with either

00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:30.000
limited time or limited resources or both,

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.160
but in the case of God,
He has both unlimited

00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:35.940
resources and unlimited time and therefore

00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:40.570
it's simply not important
to do this in a quick way.

00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:44.217
Well now Mr. Hitchens says,
"But why did God wait so long

00:58:44.217 --> 00:58:45.527
"before he sent Christ?

00:58:45.527 --> 00:58:47.537
"Human beings have existed for thousands

00:58:47.537 --> 00:58:50.960
"of years on this planet
before Christ's coming."

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:54.640
Well, what's really crucial
here is not the time

00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:57.830
involved rather it's the
population of the world.

00:58:57.830 --> 00:59:00.070
The population reference bureau estimates

00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:01.790
that the number of people
who have ever lived

00:59:01.790 --> 00:59:05.500
on this planet is about
105 billion people.

00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:08.940
Only two percent of them were born prior

00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:11.170
to the advent of Christ.

00:59:11.170 --> 00:59:13.106
Erik Kreps of the Survey Research Center

00:59:13.106 --> 00:59:15.300
of the University of Michigan's Institute

00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:18.417
for Social Research says,
"God's timing couldn't have

00:59:18.417 --> 00:59:19.787
"been more perfect.

00:59:19.787 --> 00:59:22.567
"Christ showed up just
before the exponential

00:59:22.567 --> 00:59:25.920
"explosion in the world's population."

00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:27.967
The Bible says in the fullness of time God

00:59:27.967 --> 00:59:30.856
sent forth His son and when Christ came

00:59:30.856 --> 00:59:33.670
the nation of Israel had been prepared;

00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:36.840
the Roman peace dominated
the Mediterranean world;

00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:38.950
it was an age of literacy and learning;

00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:41.630
the stage was set for the advent of God's

00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:44.930
son into the world and think in God's

00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:47.240
providential plan for human history we see

00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:51.950
the wisdom of God in
orchestrating the development

00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:54.540
of human life and then in bringing Christ

00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:57.470
into the world in the fullness of time.

00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:59.640
So I don't see that there
are any good grounds

00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:04.160
here for thinking that this
provides reason for atheism.

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.753
Now what about my arguments for theism?

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:09.553
Mr. Hitchens had some
general remarks here.

01:00:09.553 --> 01:00:13.510
He says it's difficult to
get from deism to theism.

01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:15.650
Now I want to point out that's a false

01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:18.670
use of these terms,
this is simply confused.

01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:21.520
Deism is a type of theism.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:25.140
Theism is the broad world
view that God exists.

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:28.230
Deism is a specific kind of theism that

01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:31.680
says God has not revealed
himself directly in the world.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:36.350
Now my arguments are a cumulative
case for Christian theism.

01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:39.100
They add up to the belief in the God

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:41.820
that has been revealed
by Jesus of Nazareth.

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:43.267
Now Mr. Hitchens says,

01:00:43.267 --> 01:00:45.760
"But you must prove this with certainty."

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:48.870
Not at all, I am not
claiming these arguments

01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:51.570
demonstrate Christian
theism with certainty.

01:00:51.570 --> 01:00:55.330
I'm saying this is the best
explanation of the data when

01:00:55.330 --> 01:00:58.420
you compare it with other
competing hypotheses.

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:01.010
I think it's more probable than not.

01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:04.067
He quotes me as to saying,
"The Holy Spirit's witness

01:01:04.067 --> 01:01:07.150
"is the basis for knowing
Christianity to be true,"

01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:08.530
and I affirm that.

01:01:08.530 --> 01:01:11.330
I think the fundamental way
in which we know Christianity

01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:14.370
is true is through the
objective inner witness

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:15.810
of God's Holy Spirit.

01:01:15.810 --> 01:01:18.750
What I called the immediate knowledge

01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:20.880
of God himself in my fifth point.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:24.260
On the basis of that we
have a properly basic

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:26.037
belief in the existence of God

01:01:26.037 --> 01:01:28.030
and the truth of Christianity.

01:01:28.030 --> 01:01:30.810
But when it comes to showing
someone else that what

01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:32.640
we know through the
witness of the Holy Spirit

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.710
is true here we appeal to argument

01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:36.830
and evidence as I've done tonight.

01:01:36.830 --> 01:01:39.100
And the arguments and
evidence that I've appealed

01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:41.810
to are largely deductive arguments.

01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:43.971
This isn't retrospective evidentialism,

01:01:43.971 --> 01:01:46.200
these are deductive arguments.

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.807
If the premises are true,

01:01:47.807 --> 01:01:50.240
then you cannot deny the conclusions

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.840
on pain of irrationality
because the conclusions follow

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.840
with logical necessity from the premises.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:59.690
So the only way to deny the
conclusion is you've got

01:01:59.690 --> 01:02:02.400
to show me which of
the premises are false.

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.520
That's why you've got
that program insert with

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:08.017
the premises in your
program for these arguments.

01:02:08.017 --> 01:02:10.829
Mr. Hitchens needs to
identify which premises

01:02:10.829 --> 01:02:13.750
of the argument he
rejects as false if he is

01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:15.549
to reject the conclusions.

01:02:15.549 --> 01:02:18.940
Now with respect to my
cosmological argument,

01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:20.950
notice that he didn't
dispute whatever begins

01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:22.656
to exist has a cause, nor did he dispute

01:02:22.656 --> 01:02:25.020
the philosophical and scientific arguments

01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:26.730
for the beginning of the universe.

01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:28.097
All he asked was the question,

01:02:28.097 --> 01:02:30.520
"Was there pre-existent material?"

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.130
The answer is no, there was not.

01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:34.107
As Barrow and Tipler point out,

01:02:34.107 --> 01:02:38.447
"At this singularity, space
and time came into existence.

01:02:38.447 --> 01:02:41.717
"Literally nothing existed
before the singularity.

01:02:41.717 --> 01:02:44.689
"So if the universe originated
at such a singularity,

01:02:44.689 --> 01:02:48.627
"we would truly have a creation ex nihilo,

01:02:48.627 --> 01:02:50.090
"that is, out of nothing."

01:02:50.090 --> 01:02:52.030
And this isn't talking religion, folks,

01:02:52.030 --> 01:02:54.813
this is talking contemporary cosmology.

01:02:54.813 --> 01:02:59.230
So, the first argument, it
seems to me, is unrefuted.

01:02:59.230 --> 01:03:01.723
What about the fine tuning argument?

01:03:02.650 --> 01:03:05.687
Here he said, "Well,
scientists are terribly

01:03:05.687 --> 01:03:08.570
"uncertain about the
fine tuning argument."

01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:11.360
Well, I think that's simply not the case.

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:15.940
Sir Martin Ryse, the Astronomer
Royal of Great Britain

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:18.877
has said, "The laws
governing our universe appear

01:03:18.877 --> 01:03:21.477
"to be finely tuned for our existence.

01:03:21.477 --> 01:03:24.787
"Everywhere you look there
are yet more examples.

01:03:24.787 --> 01:03:29.590
"Wherever physicists look they
see examples of fine tuning."

01:03:29.590 --> 01:03:32.777
Ernan McMullen, philosopher
of science, says,

01:03:32.777 --> 01:03:34.787
"It seems safe to say that later theory,

01:03:34.787 --> 01:03:36.777
"no matter how different it may be,

01:03:36.777 --> 01:03:38.797
"will turn up approximately the same

01:03:38.797 --> 01:03:41.117
"numbers and the numerous constraints

01:03:41.117 --> 01:03:43.287
"that have to be imposed on these numbers

01:03:43.287 --> 01:03:45.467
"seem both too specific and too numerous

01:03:45.467 --> 01:03:47.472
"to evaporate entirely."

01:03:47.472 --> 01:03:50.790
So that it's very unlikely
that this fine tuning

01:03:50.790 --> 01:03:53.770
is going to vanish or be explained away.

01:03:53.770 --> 01:03:56.547
Now, Mr. Hitchens responds,

01:03:56.547 --> 01:03:58.767
"But we're headed towards nothingness,

01:03:58.767 --> 01:04:00.577
"we're ultimately going to be doomed

01:04:00.577 --> 01:04:03.010
"and therefore the
universe is not designed."

01:04:03.010 --> 01:04:06.250
Well now, this is not a
very powerful objection.

01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:08.760
The temporal duration of something

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:11.600
is irrelevant to whether
it's been designed.

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.370
The products of human intelligence

01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:15.860
and engineering like
computers and automobiles

01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:18.135
will eventually decay and cease to exist

01:04:18.135 --> 01:04:20.850
but that doesn't mean
they weren't designed.

01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:22.580
I think the real objection
that he's getting

01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:25.600
at here is why would God create mankind

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.720
only to have it go extinct?

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:30.810
But of course, you see, on the
Christian view that's false,

01:04:30.810 --> 01:04:32.980
that is an atheistic assumption.

01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:35.830
On the Christian view life
does not end at the grave

01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:37.510
and God has given assurance of this

01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:39.520
by raising Jesus from the dead.

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:42.100
So the objection simply has no purchase

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:44.210
against Christian theism.

01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:46.150
So it seems to me that the fine tuning

01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:48.610
argument is also unrefuted.

01:04:48.610 --> 01:04:50.320
What about the moral argument?

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:53.260
We saw that without God there
are no objective moral values,

01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:56.880
Mr. Hitchens agrees with this
and yet he himself affirms

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.160
over and over again moral statements like

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:04.160
the moral reprobation
of religious intolerance

01:05:04.498 --> 01:05:06.820
and violence in the name of religion.

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:08.746
So he does affirm objective values,

01:05:08.746 --> 01:05:10.620
but without any basis for it.

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:13.860
What I can offer him as a
theist is a transcendent

01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:16.384
basis for the objective
moral values and duties

01:05:16.384 --> 01:05:18.690
that we both want to affirm.

01:05:18.690 --> 01:05:20.540
Fourthly, the resurrection of Jesus.

01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:22.810
Again, there was no response to this.

01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:24.710
Let me simply quote N.T. Wright

01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:26.910
in his recent study of the resurrection.

01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:29.547
He says that, "The empty
tomb and the appearances

01:05:29.547 --> 01:05:32.917
"of Jesus have a historical
probability so high

01:05:32.917 --> 01:05:34.947
"as to be virtually certain,

01:05:34.947 --> 01:05:37.917
"like the death of Augustus in AD 14

01:05:37.917 --> 01:05:41.260
"or the fall of Jerusalem in AD 70."

01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:43.940
So we are on very solid
ground in affirming

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:46.670
these three facts that I
mentioned in my opening speech

01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:48.820
and I can't think of
any better explanation

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:50.830
than the ones that the eye witnesses gave,

01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:53.400
namely that God raised
Jesus from the dead.

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.980
Finally, the immediate experience of God.

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:58.446
Unless Mr. Hitchens can show
that I'm psychologically

01:05:58.446 --> 01:06:00.930
deranged or delusional,

01:06:00.930 --> 01:06:03.010
it seems to me I'm perfectly rational

01:06:03.010 --> 01:06:05.070
on the basis of my immediate experience

01:06:05.070 --> 01:06:07.900
of God to believe that God exists

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:11.010
and that therefore this, for
me, is a properly basic belief.

01:06:11.010 --> 01:06:13.000
So I think all of these arguments stand

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.920
intact despite his reputation.

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:17.680
We've seen no argument for atheism,

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:20.090
so clearly the weight
of the evidence falls

01:06:20.090 --> 01:06:23.133
on the side of the scale for
Christian theism tonight.

01:06:25.439 --> 01:06:28.439
[audience applause]

01:06:44.279 --> 01:06:46.240
&gt;&gt; There is a terminological problem here

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:50.690
which may conceal more than
just terminological difficulty.

01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:53.360
The proposition that atheism is true

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:57.990
or is a misstatement
of what I have to prove

01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:59.680
and what we believe.

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.640
There's an argument among some of us as to

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:03.010
whether that we need the word at all.

01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:06.430
In other words, I don't
have a special name

01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:10.900
for my unbelief in tooth
fairies, say, or witches,

01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:12.420
or in Santa Claus.

01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:14.320
I just don't think that they're there.

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.463
I don't have to prove "atoothfairyism."

01:07:16.463 --> 01:07:19.083
I don't have to prove "asantaclausism."

01:07:19.083 --> 01:07:21.070
I don't have to prove "awitchism."

01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:23.440
It's just, I have to
say, I think that those

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.440
who do believe these
things have never been

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:31.440
able to make a plausible or
intelligible case for doing so.

01:07:31.690 --> 01:07:33.510
That's not agnosticism
because it seems to me

01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:35.710
that if you don't think
that there is any evidence

01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:37.850
you're wrong to take refuge
in saying you're neutral.

01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:39.950
You ought to have the courage
to answer the question

01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:42.990
which one is regularly asked,
"Are you an atheist or not?"

01:07:42.990 --> 01:07:44.980
Yes, I will say, I am.

01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:46.798
You can't tell anything else about me.

01:07:46.798 --> 01:07:48.700
You can't tell anything
else about what I think,

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:52.624
about what I believe,
about what my politics are

01:07:52.624 --> 01:07:53.910
or my other convictions.

01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:55.740
It's just that I don't believe in the

01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:58.840
existence of a supernatural dimension.

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:01.900
I've never been shown any
evidence that any process

01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:06.320
observable to us cannot
be explained by more

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:10.520
satisfactory and more convincing means.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:14.400
The great physicist
Laplace, when showing his

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.410
working model of the solar system to the

01:08:16.410 --> 01:08:17.607
Emperor Napoleon, was asked,

01:08:17.607 --> 01:08:22.607
"Well, you're model seems to
have no room for God in it,

01:08:22.697 --> 01:08:25.317
"for a deity," and he
said, "Well, Your Majesty,

01:08:25.317 --> 01:08:28.377
"it still all operates
without that assumption."

01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:34.820
Now, here's what you
would have to believe if

01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:38.753
you thought that this was all designed.

01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:44.450
Dr. Craig gave a slight parody
of what I think about this.

01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:47.380
It could be true, but
you'd have to imagine,

01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:49.040
let's say the human species has been,

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:51.370
Homo sapiens has been with us, some people

01:08:51.370 --> 01:08:53.470
say as long as quarter of a million years,

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:58.600
some say 200, some say 100,000.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.653
Francis Collins and Richard
Dawkins oscillate about this.

01:09:00.653 --> 01:09:02.580
It's not a very big argument.

01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:04.990
I'll just take 100,000 if you like.

01:09:04.990 --> 01:09:08.223
You have to imagine that
human beings are born,

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.040
well actually most of them, a good number

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:13.410
of them aren't born,
they die in childbirth

01:09:13.410 --> 01:09:15.670
or don't long outlive it.

01:09:15.670 --> 01:09:20.450
They're born into a terrifying
world of the unknown,

01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:22.060
everything is a mystery
to them, everything

01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:24.663
from disease to volcanic eruptions.

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:30.370
Everything is, life
expectancy for the first,

01:09:30.370 --> 01:09:32.800
I don't know, many, many tens of thousands

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:35.110
of years would be lucky
to be in the twenties,

01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:38.420
probably dying agonizingly of their teeth,

01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:41.666
poorly evolved as the teeth
are and from other inheritances

01:09:41.666 --> 01:09:43.820
from being primates such as the appendix

01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:46.130
that we don't need, such as the fact that

01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:48.670
our genitalia appear to be
designed by a committee,

01:09:48.670 --> 01:09:53.670
other short comings of the
species, exaggerated by scarcity,

01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:58.170
by war, by famine, by
competition and so on and for

01:09:58.170 --> 01:10:01.410
98,000 years or so
heaven watches this with

01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:04.683
complete indifference.
[phone pings]

01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:08.680
We know where your children
go to school, by the way.

01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:11.710
Heaven watches this
with total indifference

01:10:11.710 --> 01:10:15.047
and then with 2,000 years
to go on the clock thinks,

01:10:15.047 --> 01:10:16.797
"Actually, it's time we intervened.

01:10:17.967 --> 01:10:20.487
"We can't go on like this,
why don't we have someone

01:10:20.487 --> 01:10:24.527
"tortured to death in
Bronze Age Palestine?

01:10:24.527 --> 01:10:26.127
"That should teach them;

01:10:26.127 --> 01:10:29.050
"that should give them
a chance at redemption."

01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:32.336
You're free to believe that,
but I think the designer who

01:10:32.336 --> 01:10:35.560
thought of doing it that way is a very,

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:39.300
or was a very cruel,
capricious, random, bungling,

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:40.440
and incompetent one.

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:43.052
The news of this, Dr. Craig talks as if,

01:10:43.052 --> 01:10:46.527
"Okay, but since then
they'll be more people born

01:10:46.527 --> 01:10:48.437
"so it might have been
a good time in terms

01:10:48.437 --> 01:10:50.560
"of population growth,"
well, there are a huge number

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:54.080
of people who still haven't
even heard of this idea.

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.930
The news hasn't penetrated
to them, or where it has,

01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:58.660
it's been brought to them
by people who Dr. Craig

01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:01.890
doesn't think of as
Christians, such as Mormons,

01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:05.520
for example, and it's
taught to them in many

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:08.490
discrepant and competitive
and indeed incompatible

01:11:08.490 --> 01:11:11.420
and violently irreconcilable ways.

01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:13.750
And there's been a lot
of argument in the church

01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:16.347
and the churches all
this time about, well,

01:11:16.347 --> 01:11:17.627
"Okay, what is the answer to that?

01:11:17.627 --> 01:11:19.657
"What about all the
people who never could've

01:11:19.657 --> 01:11:22.387
"heard the good news or
who never will hear it

01:11:22.387 --> 01:11:23.847
"or still haven't been reached by it

01:11:23.847 --> 01:11:25.337
"and who've died not knowing about it?

01:11:25.337 --> 01:11:26.337
"What happens to them?

01:11:26.337 --> 01:11:27.290
"How can they be saved?"

01:11:27.290 --> 01:11:28.940
Well the argument is that it's all

01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:30.719
somehow made retrospective.

01:11:30.719 --> 01:11:33.330
And as, with so many of these arguments,

01:11:33.330 --> 01:11:35.653
I just comment on these,
well how convenient.

01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:38.190
Because if you're willing
to make assumptions

01:11:38.190 --> 01:11:41.090
of this kind then really
evidence is only ancillary

01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:44.510
to what you are advancing.

01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:48.200
Now I didn't have to chance,
oh, and just on Mr. Wright,

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:50.250
sorry I scrawled a little note to myself,

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:55.357
in your first round, Doctor,
you said that N.T. Wright,

01:11:55.357 --> 01:12:00.270
who is an impressive person,
says that no explanation

01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:02.910
of the success of Christianity is possible

01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:06.020
that doesn't rest on the
terms of its being true,

01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:08.617
in other words Wright says,
"It was so successful,

01:12:08.617 --> 01:12:10.897
"it must have been that
the people were so strongly

01:12:10.897 --> 01:12:13.290
"motivated to believe it,
that it must have been true."

01:12:13.290 --> 01:12:15.910
I regard that as a very,
very unsafe assumption.

01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:18.670
Or, if it is a safe
one, then it must surely

01:12:18.670 --> 01:12:21.260
apply to Islam and to Mormonism.

01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:22.430
I mean, these are two very, very,

01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:24.030
very fast growing religions;

01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:27.189
have people prepared to
sacrifice enormously for it;

01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:30.020
have ancestors who were
absolutely determined

01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:31.980
of the truth of it at the time and who

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.433
made extraordinary conquests in its name.

01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:36.900
If you're going to grant
this for one religion

01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:39.330
it seems to me you have to
be willing, not just willing,

01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:42.595
you may indeed be compelled
to make this concession

01:12:42.595 --> 01:12:44.400
for all of them and that, I think,

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:45.910
would be not just an unsafe assumption

01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:49.090
but for most of you here a
distinctly unwelcome one.

01:12:49.090 --> 01:12:52.630
Now, I didn't get the chance,
because I out-talked myself,

01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:56.005
I'm sorry for it, to get
to the moral dimension

01:12:56.005 --> 01:12:59.130
and I'm interested in the
fact that "objective" morality

01:12:59.130 --> 01:13:01.190
is the one that Dr. Craig chooses.

01:13:01.190 --> 01:13:03.010
Usually the arguments about
morality are whether the

01:13:03.010 --> 01:13:05.330
morality as, so to say, "absolute,"

01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:07.180
or whether it's "relative."

01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:09.580
As to objectivity I think
it's a very good compromise

01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:13.690
word by the way and I'm
very happy to accept it.

01:13:13.690 --> 01:13:17.070
But the problem with morality is this,

01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:18.500
in respect of religion:

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:22.600
You can't prove that
anyone behaves any better

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.760
if they refer to this problem upward to

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:28.653
a supreme dictator of a celestial kind.

01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:33.312
There are two questions
that I've asked in public

01:13:33.312 --> 01:13:35.590
and I'll try them again because I try them

01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:37.010
on every audience.

01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:38.100
They're very simple ones.

01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:41.310
First, you have to name
for me, challenges,

01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:42.970
let's say, rather than
questions, you have to name

01:13:42.970 --> 01:13:46.110
for me an ethical action
or an ethical statement

01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:49.690
or moral action or moral
statement made or undertaken

01:13:49.690 --> 01:13:53.850
by a believer that I
couldn't undertake or say,

01:13:53.850 --> 01:13:55.253
I couldn't state or do.

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:59.050
I haven't yet had an example
pointed out of that to me.

01:13:59.050 --> 01:14:01.490
In other words, that a
person of faith would

01:14:01.490 --> 01:14:03.460
have an advantage by being able to call

01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:05.810
upon divine sanction.

01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:08.590
Whereas if I ask you to think
of a wicked act undertaken

01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:12.340
by someone in the name of
God or because of their faith

01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:14.270
or a wicked statement
made, you wouldn't have

01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:15.950
that much difficulty,
I think, in coming up

01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:18.110
with an example right away.

01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:20.510
The genital mutilation
community, for example,

01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:22.460
is almost exclusively religious;

01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:24.390
the suicide bombing community

01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:26.850
is almost exclusively religious;

01:14:26.850 --> 01:14:30.670
there are injunctions for
genocide in the Old Testament;

01:14:30.670 --> 01:14:32.700
there are injunctions,
warrants for slavery

01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:34.890
and racism in the Old Testament too.

01:14:34.890 --> 01:14:37.920
There's simply no way of deriving morality

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:39.953
and ethics from the supernatural.

01:14:41.150 --> 01:14:44.470
When we come to the question
of the absolute, well,

01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:48.030
the most often cited
one is the Golden Rule,

01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:50.600
the one that almost everyone
feels they have in common.

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.630
The injunction not to do to others as you

01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:54.730
wouldn't want them to do to you.

01:14:54.730 --> 01:14:56.810
This doesn't in fact come
from the Sermon on the Mount

01:14:56.810 --> 01:14:59.690
or from Christianity, or it
doesn't originate with it.

01:14:59.690 --> 01:15:01.620
It's certainly adumbrated by Rabbi Hillel,

01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:03.350
a Babylonian rabbi,
and it's to be found in

01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:05.440
The Analects of Confucius, too.

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:08.850
But it has, since we're talking
about objective, relative,

01:15:08.850 --> 01:15:12.640
and absolute, a crucial
weakness in it, unfortunately.

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.780
We'd like to be able to follow it

01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:17.067
but it's really only as good
as the person uttering it.

01:15:17.067 --> 01:15:20.290
In others words, if I
say I won't treat you

01:15:20.290 --> 01:15:22.370
as I don't want you to treat me,

01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:24.970
what am I to do when
confronted with Charles Manson?

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:27.458
I want him treated in a way that

01:15:27.458 --> 01:15:30.200
I wouldn't want to be treated myself.

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:34.370
Anything else would surely
be completely relativistic.

01:15:34.370 --> 01:15:37.180
So the argument isn't at all advanced

01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:39.900
by saying that I couldn't
know any of this;

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:42.380
I couldn't have any moral promptings;

01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:45.190
I couldn't decide for myself
if I see a pregnant woman

01:15:45.190 --> 01:15:48.150
being kicked in the stomach
that, because she's pregnant,

01:15:48.150 --> 01:15:51.150
that's obviously worse than if it was just

01:15:51.150 --> 01:15:53.740
a woman who wasn't pregnant
being kicked in the stomach.

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:57.010
This is part of my
patrimony as a human being.

01:15:57.010 --> 01:16:00.010
It's part of the essential
emotional solidarity

01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:03.000
that I need to have
with my fellow creatures

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.010
to make us realize that we
are brothers and sisters,

01:16:06.010 --> 01:16:07.160
one with another.

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:09.520
We are dependent upon each
other; we have duties;

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:12.240
we have expectations
of one another and that

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:14.440
if we didn't have these,
and try and fulfill them,

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:16.350
we couldn't have gotten as far as we have.

01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:18.630
We couldn't have evolved as a species;

01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:20.650
we couldn't have ever had a society.

01:16:20.650 --> 01:16:23.320
There's never been a
society found where rape

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:26.534
and murder and perjury are not condemned.

01:16:26.534 --> 01:16:30.100
These moral discoveries
long, or absolutes,

01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:32.350
if you want to call
them that, long predate

01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:36.860
the arrival of anything
recognizable as monotheism.

01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:39.810
It's a bit like the argument of free will.

01:16:39.810 --> 01:16:43.517
People say, "Well, how
do you have free will?

01:16:43.517 --> 01:16:44.780
"Do you think you do have it?"

01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:47.980
Well, it's a very, very
difficult subject indeed.

01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:50.223
Some religions say you
don't in effect have it.

01:16:50.223 --> 01:16:52.530
That all is determined
by heaven, you're really

01:16:52.530 --> 01:16:54.400
only a play thing in a larger game.

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.910
I take that to be that some
of the point of Calvinism.

01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:59.737
There are some schools
of Islam also that say,

01:16:59.737 --> 01:17:02.222
"It is only as Allah wills."

01:17:02.222 --> 01:17:04.970
There's no will of yours really involved

01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:06.776
as long as you're willing
to make the prostration

01:17:06.776 --> 01:17:08.120
and the obedience.

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.830
So the connection between
religion and free will

01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:13.193
isn't as simple, as easy
as some people think it is.

01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:16.647
But I would say, yes, I
think we have free will.

01:17:16.647 --> 01:17:20.320
And when asked why I think so,
I would have to take refuge

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:21.897
in philosophical irony and say,

01:17:21.897 --> 01:17:23.827
"Because I don't think we have any choice

01:17:23.827 --> 01:17:26.780
"but to have free will."
[audience laughing]

01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:30.830
Well at least I know at
this point that I'm being

01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:33.540
ironic and that some of
the irony is at my own

01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:37.150
expense and it's a risk I
have to be willing to run.

01:17:37.150 --> 01:17:38.507
But the Christian answer is,

01:17:38.507 --> 01:17:42.357
"Of course you have free will,
the boss insists upon it."

01:17:43.428 --> 01:17:44.830
[audience laughing]

01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:47.870
This somewhat degrades
the freedom and redefines

01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:51.010
the idea of will and it seems to me also

01:17:51.010 --> 01:17:52.810
that there's something
degrading in the idea

01:17:52.810 --> 01:17:56.200
of that saying that morality
is derived in the same way.

01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:59.460
That it comes from on
high; that we, ourselves,

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:02.450
are not good enough, that
we don't have the dignity,

01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:03.730
we don't have the self respect,

01:18:03.730 --> 01:18:06.310
we don't have the character
to know a right action

01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:07.780
or a right statement when we see it

01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:09.900
or when we want to perform it.

01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:12.610
It's this servile element in religion.

01:18:12.610 --> 01:18:14.320
It's not strictly speaking the subject

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.440
of our debate this evening,
I know, but I'm damned

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:20.360
if I completely forgo
it, it's the idea that,

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.730
buried in the religious impulse,

01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:24.790
is actually the wish to
be unfree, is the wish

01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:29.630
for an immovable, unchangeable,
celestial authority,

01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:34.630
a kind of heavenly North Korea
that will take our decisions

01:18:36.277 --> 01:18:38.810
away from us and commit us only to worship

01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:42.840
and praise and thank a
Great Leader and his son,

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:45.570
the Dear Leader, forever
and ever and ever.

01:18:45.570 --> 01:18:47.480
I'm so glad that there's no
evidence that this is true.

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:48.313
Thank you.

01:18:50.055 --> 01:18:53.055
[audience applause]

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:02.660
&gt;&gt; We now enter the period
of cross examination which,

01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:06.580
trial like, allows the questioner to pose

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:09.030
and the answerer only to
answer and not to repeat the

01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:10.730
question or to dodge.

01:19:10.730 --> 01:19:13.540
Six minutes of questions
begin to Dr. Craig

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:16.190
followed by six minutes of
questions to Mr. Hitchens.

01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:18.520
Dr. Craig, your questions
for Mr. Hitchens.

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:19.353
&gt;&gt; All right.

01:19:19.353 --> 01:19:22.200
Let's talk first about whether
there are any good arguments

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:24.740
to think that atheism is true.

01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:28.570
Now, it seems to me that
you're rather ambivalent here,

01:19:28.570 --> 01:19:32.930
that you say, you redefine atheism to mean

01:19:32.930 --> 01:19:36.917
a sort of ah-theism or non-theism.

01:19:36.917 --> 01:19:39.220
&gt;&gt; Christopher: That's what it means.

01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:42.120
&gt;&gt; But, how do you distinguish, then,

01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:45.070
the different varieties of non-theism.

01:19:45.070 --> 01:19:48.439
For example, what is
normally called atheism,

01:19:48.439 --> 01:19:52.505
agnosticism, or the view
of verificationists,

01:19:52.505 --> 01:19:56.073
the statement "God exists"
is simply meaningless?

01:19:57.870 --> 01:19:59.480
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, there
are different schools

01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:02.470
of atheism as you say,
but there's no claim

01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:04.972
I know how to make that
says atheism is true

01:20:04.972 --> 01:20:06.553
because atheism is the statement that

01:20:06.553 --> 01:20:08.960
a certain proposition isn't true.

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.760
So I wish you'd get
this bit right because,

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.700
there you go again.

01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:15.930
I've just devoted a little time to this.

01:20:15.930 --> 01:20:20.627
I said it is not, in itself,
a belief or a system,

01:20:20.627 --> 01:20:25.627
it simply says you can by
get by better, probably,

01:20:25.670 --> 01:20:27.320
we think, without the assumption

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.810
and that no one who wants you to worship

01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:31.570
a god has ever been able to come up with

01:20:31.570 --> 01:20:33.470
a good enough reason to make you to do it.

01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:35.610
&gt;&gt; Now, so, the point is, though,

01:20:35.610 --> 01:20:40.170
that on your definition of ah-theism

01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:44.230
or nontheism, it really
embodies a diversity

01:20:44.230 --> 01:20:46.690
of views such as agnosticism,

01:20:46.690 --> 01:20:51.477
what is normally called atheism,
or this verificationism.

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:55.700
Now, which of those do you hold to within

01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:57.550
this umbrella of ah-theism?

01:20:57.550 --> 01:21:01.477
Are you an atheist who
asserts the proposition

01:21:01.477 --> 01:21:04.840
"God does not exist" or
do you simply withhold

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:07.660
belief in God in the way
that the agnostic does?

01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:08.493
&gt;&gt; Right.

01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:14.460
On some days I'm a great--
[audience laughing]

01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:16.513
No, I'm not going to do
you that much of a favor.

01:21:18.147 --> 01:21:20.590
On some days I'm a great
admirer of Thomas Huxley

01:21:20.590 --> 01:21:24.250
who had the great debate
with Bishop Wilberforce

01:21:24.250 --> 01:21:27.890
in Oxford at the Natural
History Museum about Darwinism

01:21:27.890 --> 01:21:29.850
in the mid-19th century,

01:21:29.850 --> 01:21:32.000
who was known as Darwin's bulldog.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.400
We would now say Darwin's pitbull.

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.600
And who completely
trounced the good bishop.

01:21:37.610 --> 01:21:39.777
But, I can't thank him
for inventing the term

01:21:39.777 --> 01:21:42.500
"agnostic" and I can't
thank him for some of

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:43.723
his social Darwinist positions either,

01:21:43.723 --> 01:21:45.160
some of which are rather unattractive--

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.897
&gt;&gt; I need an answer to
this, my time is fleeting.

01:21:46.897 --> 01:21:50.450
&gt;&gt; Yes, because I think
agnosticism is evasive.

01:21:50.450 --> 01:21:52.790
To me, yes, if you talk about the power

01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:54.140
of the Holy Spirit and so forth,

01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:57.210
to me that is meaningless,
it's, to me, I'm sorry,

01:21:57.210 --> 01:21:59.580
I've tried, it's white noise.

01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:01.387
It's like saying, "There is only one God

01:22:01.387 --> 01:22:02.920
"and Allah is his messenger."

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:04.399
It's gibberish to me.

01:22:04.399 --> 01:22:07.130
There are many of us, I'm
sorry there are just many

01:22:07.130 --> 01:22:10.220
of us to whom, of whom this is the case.

01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:13.120
It may be true, it is true that religion--

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.120
&gt;&gt; William: I gotta press you here,

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:15.690
'cause time is fleeting.

01:22:15.690 --> 01:22:18.351
What is your view exactly?
&gt;&gt; Press away.

01:22:18.351 --> 01:22:20.734
&gt;&gt; Do you affirm God does not exist,

01:22:20.734 --> 01:22:22.396
or do you simply withhold belief?

01:22:22.396 --> 01:22:24.340
&gt;&gt; I think once I have said
that I've never seen any

01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:26.650
persuasive evidence for
the existence of something,

01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:30.400
and I've made real attempts to
study the evidence presented

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:31.233
and the arguments presented,

01:22:31.233 --> 01:22:33.730
that I will go as far as to say,

01:22:33.730 --> 01:22:37.290
have the nerve to say, that
it does not therefore exist

01:22:37.290 --> 01:22:38.450
except in the minds of its--

01:22:38.450 --> 01:22:39.592
&gt;&gt; William: All right, so--

01:22:39.592 --> 01:22:43.750
&gt;&gt; Except in the Henry
Jamesian subject of sense

01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:47.250
that you say of it being
so real to some people

01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:50.990
in their own minds that it
counts as a force in the world.

01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:52.970
&gt;&gt; Craig: Okay, so you do affirm then

01:22:52.970 --> 01:22:54.660
that God does not exist.

01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:56.200
Now, what I want to know, and do you have

01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:58.590
any justification for that?

01:22:58.590 --> 01:23:00.418
&gt;&gt; I think I've come unwired.

01:23:00.418 --> 01:23:01.251
&gt;&gt; William: You're fine.

01:23:01.251 --> 01:23:02.740
&gt;&gt; Are you sure?
[audience laughing]

01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:07.100
&gt;&gt; Do you have any arguments
leading to the conclusion

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:09.540
that God does not exist?

01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:11.660
&gt;&gt; Well I would rather,
I think, I'm wondering

01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:13.290
if I'm boring anybody now.

01:23:13.290 --> 01:23:17.380
I would rather say, I'd
rather state it in reverse

01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:19.820
and say I find all the arguments in favor

01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:22.532
to be fallacious or unconvincing.

01:23:22.532 --> 01:23:25.600
And I'd have to add, that
though this isn't my reason

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:28.300
for not believing in it, that
I would be very depressed

01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:29.690
if it was true.

01:23:29.690 --> 01:23:31.948
That's quite a different thing.

01:23:31.948 --> 01:23:35.350
I don't say of atheism that
it's at all morally superior,

01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:36.310
that would be very risky.

01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:38.450
I wouldn't admit that it was
at all morally inferior either,

01:23:38.450 --> 01:23:39.990
but we can at least be acquitted

01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:42.030
on the charge of wishful thinking.

01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:42.863
We don't particularly--

01:23:42.863 --> 01:23:44.850
&gt;&gt; I wonder if that's the case.

01:23:44.850 --> 01:23:48.009
Would you agree that
the absence of evidence

01:23:48.009 --> 01:23:50.323
is not evidence of absence?

01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:54.770
&gt;&gt; Well you know, I'm not
sure that I would agree.

01:23:54.770 --> 01:23:55.730
&gt;&gt; Okay.

01:23:55.730 --> 01:23:57.827
Let's turn to the moral
argument and talk about that

01:23:57.827 --> 01:23:58.660
a little bit.

01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:01.456
I think you've misunderstood
the moral argument--

01:24:01.456 --> 01:24:04.610
&gt;&gt; Given the stakes, Doctor,
sorry, given the stakes,

01:24:04.610 --> 01:24:06.030
I mean you're not
saying, we're not talking

01:24:06.030 --> 01:24:09.460
about unicorns or tooth
fairies or leprechauns here,

01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:11.800
we're talking about an
authority that would

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:15.230
give other humans beings the
right to tell me what to do

01:24:15.230 --> 01:24:16.470
in the name of God.

01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:19.940
So, for a claim like that if
there's no evidence for it,

01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:21.833
it seems to me a very,

01:24:22.830 --> 01:24:24.900
not a small question.

01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:26.690
&gt;&gt; No, it's certainly
not a small question.

01:24:26.690 --> 01:24:28.960
&gt;&gt; Because you're making a
very, very, very large claim.

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:31.240
Your evidence had been be
absolutely magnificent,

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:32.200
it seems to me.

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:33.740
and it's the lack of magnificence

01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:36.250
I think that began to strike me first.

01:24:36.250 --> 01:24:37.730
&gt;&gt; Hugh: One final question, doctor.

01:24:37.730 --> 01:24:39.440
&gt;&gt; Okay, well let's go
to the moral argument.

01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:41.240
It seems to me there
that you've misunderstood

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:44.240
the argument, in that we're looking for an

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:47.550
objective foundation for the moral values

01:24:47.550 --> 01:24:50.320
and duties that we want, we
both I think want to affirm.

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:53.060
It's not a matter of
whether or not we can know

01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:55.520
what is right and wrong,
or that we need God

01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:57.430
to tell us what is right and wrong,

01:24:57.430 --> 01:24:59.310
it's rather that we need
to have some sort of

01:24:59.310 --> 01:25:02.080
an objective foundation
for right and wrong.

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:05.520
Wouldn't you agree on
your view it's simply the

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:08.250
socio-biological spinoffs
of the evolutionary

01:25:08.250 --> 01:25:10.639
process and that therefore
these do not provide

01:25:10.639 --> 01:25:14.510
any sort of objective foundation

01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:16.463
for moral values and duties?

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.790
&gt;&gt; That could be true, yes.

01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:20.869
&gt;&gt; William: Okay.

01:25:20.869 --> 01:25:21.702
&gt;&gt; Could well be true.

01:25:21.702 --> 01:25:22.535
Yeah.

01:25:22.535 --> 01:25:24.260
I don't want to be too
much of a reductionist,

01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:26.550
but it's entirely
possible that it is purely

01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:27.950
evolutionary and functional.

01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:29.750
One wants to think that
there's a bit more to

01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:32.200
one's love for the fellow
creature than that.

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:35.831
But it doesn't add one iota of weight

01:25:35.831 --> 01:25:39.120
or moral gravity to the
argument to say that's

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.847
because I don't believe
in a supernatural being.

01:25:41.847 --> 01:25:42.847
It's a non sequitur.

01:25:43.739 --> 01:25:45.730
&gt;&gt; Hugh: Mr. Hitchens, your
questions for Dr. Craig.

01:25:45.730 --> 01:25:48.900
&gt;&gt; Ah, well, I'd like to know first,

01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:49.790
you said

01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:55.130
that the career of Jesus
of Nazareth involved

01:25:55.130 --> 01:25:57.553
a ministry of miracles and exorcisms.

01:25:58.450 --> 01:26:01.390
When you say "exorcism,"
do you mean that you

01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:02.910
believe in devils too?

01:26:02.910 --> 01:26:05.110
&gt;&gt; What I meant there
was that most historians

01:26:05.110 --> 01:26:09.019
agree that Jesus of Nazareth
practiced miracle working

01:26:09.019 --> 01:26:11.140
and he practiced exorcisms.

01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:12.970
I'm not committing myself,

01:26:12.970 --> 01:26:15.240
nor are historians committing themselves,

01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:17.350
to the reality of demons
but they are saying

01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:22.350
that Jesus did practice exorcism
and he practiced healing.

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:28.550
&gt;&gt; So you believe that Jesus of Nazareth

01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:31.410
caused devils to leave
the body of a madman

01:26:31.410 --> 01:26:34.790
and go into a flock of
pigs that hurled themselves

01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:36.690
down the Gadarene slopes into the sea?

01:26:36.690 --> 01:26:38.820
&gt;&gt; Do I believe that's historical?

01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:39.653
Yes.

01:26:39.653 --> 01:26:41.030
&gt;&gt; Christopher: Right.

01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:43.600
That would be sorcery wouldn't it, though?

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:46.790
&gt;&gt; No, it would be an
illustration of Jesus'

01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:49.710
ability to command even
the forces of darkness

01:26:49.710 --> 01:26:51.930
and therefore an illustration of the sort

01:26:51.930 --> 01:26:54.470
of divine authority that he was able

01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:55.800
to command and exercise.

01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:00.730
This, as I say, is illustrative
of this unprecedented

01:27:00.730 --> 01:27:04.260
sense of divine authority
that Jesus of Nazareth

01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:06.505
had that he even could command the forces

01:27:06.505 --> 01:27:09.380
of darkness and that they would obey.

01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:13.240
So, whether you think he
was a genuine exorcist

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:16.000
or that he merely believed
himself to be an exorcist,

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.250
what is historically undeniable is that he

01:27:18.250 --> 01:27:22.630
had this radical sense of divine authority

01:27:22.630 --> 01:27:26.480
which he expressed by miracle
working and exorcisms.

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:27.313
&gt;&gt; Right.

01:27:27.313 --> 01:27:30.360
And do you believe he
was born of a virgin?

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:31.490
&gt;&gt; Um.

01:27:31.490 --> 01:27:33.850
Yes, I believe that as a Christian.

01:27:33.850 --> 01:27:35.970
I couldn't claim to
prove that, historically.

01:27:35.970 --> 01:27:38.060
That's not part of my case tonight.

01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:40.560
But I, as a Christian, I believe that.

01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.581
&gt;&gt; And I know you believe
in the resurrection but--

01:27:42.581 --> 01:27:45.340
&gt;&gt; Williams: Yes, that I
think we have good evidence.

01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:47.790
&gt;&gt; As a matter of biblical,
what shall we call it,

01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:51.440
consistency, it's said
in one of the Gospels

01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:53.050
that at the time of the crucifixion

01:27:53.050 --> 01:27:54.666
all the graves of Jerusalem were opened

01:27:54.666 --> 01:27:57.700
and all the tenants of the
graves walked the streets

01:27:57.700 --> 01:27:58.640
and greeted their old friends.

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.990
It makes resurrection
sound rather commonplace

01:28:00.990 --> 01:28:02.892
in the greater Jerusalem area.

01:28:02.892 --> 01:28:05.340
&gt;&gt; That's in the gospel of
Matthew and that's actually

01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:08.076
attached to a crucifixion
narrative where--

01:28:08.076 --> 01:28:09.076
&gt;&gt; Christopher: That's what I said,

01:28:09.076 --> 01:28:09.909
it says at the time of the crucifixion.

01:28:09.909 --> 01:28:11.300
&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right, at
the time of the crucifixion

01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:14.104
it says that there were
appearances of Old Testament

01:28:14.104 --> 01:28:16.830
saints in Jerusalem at the time.

01:28:16.830 --> 01:28:19.460
This is part of Matthew's description

01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:21.390
of the crucifixion scene.

01:28:21.390 --> 01:28:22.900
&gt;&gt; Christopher: I mean,
do you believe that?

01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:25.010
&gt;&gt; I don't know whether
Matthew intends this to be

01:28:25.010 --> 01:28:27.690
apocalyptic imagery or
whether he means this

01:28:27.690 --> 01:28:28.670
to be taken literally.

01:28:28.670 --> 01:28:30.610
I've not studied it in any depth

01:28:30.610 --> 01:28:32.360
and I'm open minded about it.

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:34.287
I'm willing to be convinced
one way or the other.

01:28:34.287 --> 01:28:35.690
&gt;&gt; You see the reason
I'm pressing you is this:

01:28:35.690 --> 01:28:37.470
Because, I mean, we know from Scripture

01:28:37.470 --> 01:28:40.890
that Pharoahs' magicians
could produce miracles.

01:28:40.890 --> 01:28:42.650
In the end, Aaron could outproduce them,

01:28:42.650 --> 01:28:43.820
but what I'm suggesting to you is even

01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:45.980
if the laws of nature can be suspended

01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:50.310
and great miracles can be performed,

01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:51.820
it doesn't prove the truth of the doctrine

01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:53.620
of the person who's performing them.

01:28:54.523 --> 01:28:55.780
Would you not agree to that?

01:28:55.780 --> 01:28:58.800
&gt;&gt; William: Not necessarily,
I think that's right.

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:01.267
&gt;&gt; So somebody could be
casting out devils from pigs

01:29:01.267 --> 01:29:03.530
and that wouldn't prove
he was the son of God?

01:29:03.530 --> 01:29:04.420
&gt;&gt; I think that's right.

01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:06.170
In fact, there were Jewish exorcists.

01:29:06.170 --> 01:29:09.110
The only point that I was
trying to make there was,

01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:11.800
that this was illustrative of the kind

01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:14.470
of divine authority that Jesus claimed,

01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:16.281
especially since He didn't cast them out--

01:29:16.281 --> 01:29:17.114
&gt;&gt; Christopher: But if--

01:29:17.114 --> 01:29:19.370
&gt;&gt; In God's name or He
didn't perform miracles

01:29:19.370 --> 01:29:23.080
by praying to God, He would
do them in His own authority,

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:27.377
so that Jesus exercised an
authority that was simply

01:29:27.377 --> 01:29:31.451
unheard of at that time and,
for which He was eventually

01:29:31.451 --> 01:29:35.103
crucified because it was
thought to be blasphemous.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.060
&gt;&gt; Well, it was though to be blasphemous

01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:38.320
to have claimed to be
the Messiah, to be exact.

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:40.640
I mean, the people who got
the closest look at him,

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:43.168
the Jewish Sanhedrin,
thought that his claims were

01:29:43.168 --> 01:29:46.240
not genuine so, remember,
if you're resting anything

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:48.043
on eye witnesses, the ones
who we definitely know

01:29:48.043 --> 01:29:51.010
were there thought he was bogus.

01:29:51.010 --> 01:29:53.240
But okay, I think I've got a rough idea.

01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:55.640
Assuming you make that assumption of

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.100
his pre-existing divinity,

01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:59.730
that it's a presuppositionalist case,

01:29:59.730 --> 01:30:00.930
I can see what you're driving at.

01:30:00.930 --> 01:30:02.220
&gt;&gt; Well no, I'm not a presuppositionalist.

01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:04.120
&gt;&gt; I've got another question
for you, which is this:

01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:07.140
How many religions in the world
do you believe to be false?

01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:08.970
&gt;&gt; I don't know how many
religions in the world

01:30:08.970 --> 01:30:13.614
there are, so I can't--
[audience laughing]

01:30:13.614 --> 01:30:14.864
&gt;&gt; Fair enough.

01:30:14.864 --> 01:30:17.073
I'll see if I can't narrow that down.

01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:20.780
That was a clumsily asked
question, I'll admit.

01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:23.693
Do you regard any of the
world's religions to be false?

01:30:23.693 --> 01:30:24.693
&gt;&gt; William: Excuse me?

01:30:24.693 --> 01:30:25.526
&gt;&gt; Do you regard any of
the world's religions

01:30:25.526 --> 01:30:26.359
to be false preaching?

01:30:26.359 --> 01:30:28.700
&gt;&gt; William: Yes, yes, I think, certainly.

01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:30.100
&gt;&gt; Would you name one then?

01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:30.980
&gt;&gt; Islam.

01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:32.580
&gt;&gt; Christopher: That's quite a lot.

01:30:32.580 --> 01:30:33.413
&gt;&gt; Pardon me?

01:30:33.413 --> 01:30:34.246
&gt;&gt; Christopher: That's quite a lot.

01:30:34.246 --> 01:30:35.150
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:30:35.150 --> 01:30:36.430
&gt;&gt; Christopher: Therefore,
do you think it's moral

01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:38.090
to preach false religion?

01:30:38.090 --> 01:30:38.923
&gt;&gt; No.

01:30:38.923 --> 01:30:39.820
&gt;&gt; Christopher: So religion
is responsible for quite

01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:41.180
a lot of wickedness in
the world right there?

01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:42.180
&gt;&gt; Certainly.

01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:45.280
I'd be happy to concede that,
I would agree with that.

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:48.910
&gt;&gt; So if I was a baby being
born in Saudi Arabia today,

01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:52.113
would you rather I was
me, or a Wahabi Muslim?

01:30:53.237 --> 01:30:55.129
&gt;&gt; Would you rather be what?
[audience laughing]

01:30:55.129 --> 01:30:58.700
&gt;&gt; Would you rather it was
me, it was an atheist baby,

01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:03.033
or a Wahabi baby?
[audience laughing]

01:31:06.130 --> 01:31:11.130
&gt;&gt; I don't have any, uh,
preference as to whether you--

01:31:11.597 --> 01:31:15.788
[audience laughing]
[applause]

01:31:15.788 --> 01:31:18.323
&gt;&gt; As bad as that, okay.

01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:21.403
Are there any,

01:31:22.426 --> 01:31:24.590
sorry, I've only got a few seconds.

01:31:24.590 --> 01:31:26.720
It's a serious question,
I should squander it.

01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:29.550
Are there any Christian
denominations you regard as false?

01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:30.590
&gt;&gt; William: Certainly.

01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:32.100
&gt;&gt; Christopher: Could
I know what they are?

01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:33.103
&gt;&gt; Um.

01:31:34.530 --> 01:31:39.130
Well, uh, I'm not a
Calvinist, for example.

01:31:39.130 --> 01:31:41.550
I think that certain tenets of

01:31:41.550 --> 01:31:43.800
Reformed Theology are incorrect.

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:48.140
I would be more in Wesleyan camp myself.

01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:51.260
But, these are differences among brethren.

01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:54.660
these are not difference on which we need

01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:56.750
to put one another into
some sort of a cage.

01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:58.660
So, within the Christian camp,

01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:01.160
there's a large diversity of perspectives.

01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:02.750
I'm sure there are views that I hold

01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:05.573
that are probably false
but I'm trying my best

01:32:05.573 --> 01:32:09.050
to get my theology straight,
trying to do the best job

01:32:09.050 --> 01:32:11.650
but I think all of us
would recognize that none

01:32:11.650 --> 01:32:14.790
of us agree on every point
of Christian doctrine,

01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:17.730
on every dot and tittle.

01:32:17.730 --> 01:32:20.470
&gt;&gt; Before Mr. Hitchens
succeeds in launching another

01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:23.785
series of religious wars among
Christians let's get to the--

01:32:23.785 --> 01:32:25.867
[audience laughing]

01:32:25.867 --> 01:32:28.950
Let's get to the responses,
seven minutes each.

01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:31.599
Dr. Craig, it is your seven minutes.

01:32:31.599 --> 01:32:32.432
&gt;&gt; Okay.

01:32:33.533 --> 01:32:36.866
[William clears throat]

01:32:52.490 --> 01:32:55.290
Well, I think it's very evident
that in tonight's debate,

01:32:55.290 --> 01:32:58.960
we've not heard any good
reasons to think that what is

01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:01.640
normally called atheism is true,

01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:04.090
that is to say the belief
that God does notexist.

01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:09.800
Mr. Hitchens withholds
belief in God but he's unable

01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:12.140
to give us any argument to think that God

01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:16.700
does not exist which is what
is called positive atheism.

01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:18.850
Now he does mention that the human species

01:33:18.850 --> 01:33:21.950
has been here for 100,000 years but I've

01:33:21.950 --> 01:33:23.160
already responded to that.

01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:26.000
What's crucial there is
not the number of years,

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.710
it's the population and only
two percent of the population

01:33:29.710 --> 01:33:32.040
of the earth has existed before Christ.

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:34.840
And during that time
God is not indifferent

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:38.410
to the lot of those people,
rather he is preparing humanity,

01:33:38.410 --> 01:33:41.320
preparing the world for
the advent of Christ

01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:43.940
so that in the fullness
of time Christ would come

01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:44.980
into the world.

01:33:44.980 --> 01:33:47.870
And those people who
lived apart from Christ,

01:33:47.870 --> 01:33:50.290
God cared for them as well
and provided for them.

01:33:50.290 --> 01:33:53.947
The Bible says, "Ever since
the creation of the world,

01:33:53.947 --> 01:33:57.327
"God's invisible nature,
namely His eternal power

01:33:57.327 --> 01:34:00.040
"and deity has been clearly
perceived in the things

01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:01.505
"that have been made."

01:34:01.505 --> 01:34:05.967
Paul says that, "From one man
God made every nation of men,

01:34:05.967 --> 01:34:08.127
"that they should inhabit the whole earth

01:34:08.127 --> 01:34:10.617
"and He determined the time set for them

01:34:10.617 --> 01:34:13.657
"in the exact places
that they should live.

01:34:13.657 --> 01:34:17.617
"He did this so men would
seek Him and perhaps reach out

01:34:17.617 --> 01:34:21.177
"for Him and find Him, for
He is not far from each

01:34:21.177 --> 01:34:25.370
"one of us, for in Him we live
and move and have our being."

01:34:25.370 --> 01:34:28.530
So that those who lived
before Christ were covered

01:34:28.530 --> 01:34:30.270
by the death of Christ, they were covered

01:34:30.270 --> 01:34:34.084
by his atoning sacrifice
and God will judge them

01:34:34.084 --> 01:34:36.150
on the basis of the information that

01:34:36.150 --> 01:34:39.020
they had in their response
to general revelation.

01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:42.440
Similar to those who haven't
heard the Gospel yet today,

01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:45.850
they will be judged on the
basis of the information that

01:34:45.850 --> 01:34:48.050
they do have and how they respond to that.

01:34:48.050 --> 01:34:50.990
And aren't you glad that you
don't have to judge them?

01:34:50.990 --> 01:34:54.270
You can leave this up
to the hands of a just

01:34:54.270 --> 01:34:57.350
and holy and merciful
God who will judge people

01:34:57.350 --> 01:35:00.088
on the basis of how they
respond to the revelation

01:35:00.088 --> 01:35:02.080
that they do have.

01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:05.110
So we've not heard any
argument tonight that God

01:35:05.110 --> 01:35:06.550
does not exist.

01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:09.010
Now, by contrast, I've
given five arguments

01:35:09.010 --> 01:35:11.270
to show that Christian theism is true.

01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:14.323
First, we saw the cosmological argument.

01:35:15.210 --> 01:35:17.980
Mr. Hitchens has not disagreed with either

01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:20.460
of the premises of this
argument and so we have

01:35:20.460 --> 01:35:22.810
good grounds to believe
in the personal creator

01:35:22.810 --> 01:35:24.090
of the universe.

01:35:24.090 --> 01:35:27.770
As for the teleological
argument, again he didn't

01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:30.240
respond to what I said in my last speech

01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:34.110
with respect to the fine
tuning being well established

01:35:34.110 --> 01:35:38.020
in science and that the
fact that we're going

01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:39.530
towards nothingness as he puts it,

01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:43.240
is an atheistic assumption,
not a Christian assumption

01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:46.238
and therefore doesn't do
anything to disprove design.

01:35:46.238 --> 01:35:48.100
Now what about the moral argument?

01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:51.607
Here he says that, "You have
to prove that people would

01:35:51.607 --> 01:35:54.560
"behave better if they believed in God."

01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:57.960
That's not the argument, I
hope that's clear to everyone.

01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:01.176
The argument is that without
God as a transcendent

01:36:01.176 --> 01:36:03.540
foundation for moral values,

01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:07.060
we're simply lost in
socio-cultural relativism.

01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:10.220
Who are you to judge that
the Nazi ethic was wrong?

01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:12.330
Who are you to judge
that the ethic of ancient

01:36:12.330 --> 01:36:13.380
Hinduism was wrong?

01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:17.990
Who are you to judge that the
Africana apartheid is wrong?

01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:20.250
This is all just the
result of socio-cultural

01:36:20.250 --> 01:36:23.100
evolution and there is
no transcendent objective

01:36:23.100 --> 01:36:27.810
standard apart from God and
that's what God delivers for us.

01:36:27.810 --> 01:36:28.857
Now Mr. Hitchens says,

01:36:28.857 --> 01:36:32.300
"Name one moral action that
an unbeliever could not take."

01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:34.260
Well, that's trivially easy.

01:36:34.260 --> 01:36:36.680
If God exists there are
all kinds of moral duties

01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:39.580
that we have that the
unbeliever cannot recognize.

01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:41.800
At the panel discussion
last week in Dallas,

01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:45.980
when Mr. Hitchens demanded that
someone name such an action,

01:36:45.980 --> 01:36:48.797
a pastor on the panel
immediately piped up,

01:36:48.797 --> 01:36:52.400
"How about tithing?"
[audience laughing]

01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:57.296
Well, leave it to a pastor to
think of that, but, clearly,

01:36:57.296 --> 01:37:01.490
that's an action that only
a believer would take.

01:37:01.490 --> 01:37:03.500
Even more fundamentally,
what about the first

01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:04.817
and greatest commandment?

01:37:04.817 --> 01:37:07.747
"You shall love the Lord
your God with all your heart,

01:37:07.747 --> 01:37:10.260
"with all your strength,
with all your mind."

01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:13.320
That is an action that
only a believer can take,

01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:15.840
no unbeliever can discharge even this most

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:18.500
fundamental of moral duties.

01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:21.280
But, in any case, all of this is beside

01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:23.740
the point with respect
to the moral argument.

01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:26.190
The point is that on atheism there are

01:37:26.190 --> 01:37:29.770
no moral obligations
for anybody to fulfill.

01:37:29.770 --> 01:37:33.770
In nature, whatever is,
is right and Mr. Hitchens

01:37:33.770 --> 01:37:37.867
is unable to provide any
sort of objective foundation

01:37:37.867 --> 01:37:39.812
for moral values.

01:37:39.812 --> 01:37:43.910
Massimo Pigliucci is a
philosopher of biology.

01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:45.780
This is what he has to say.

01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:47.777
He says on atheism,
"There is no such thing

01:37:47.777 --> 01:37:49.427
"as objective morality.

01:37:49.427 --> 01:37:51.647
"Morality in human cultures has evolved

01:37:51.647 --> 01:37:53.817
"and what is moral for
you might not be moral

01:37:53.817 --> 01:37:56.597
"for the guy next door
and certainly is not moral

01:37:56.597 --> 01:37:58.227
"for the guy across the ocean.

01:37:58.227 --> 01:38:00.687
"And what makes you think
that your personal morality

01:38:00.687 --> 01:38:03.067
"is the one and everybody else is wrong?

01:38:03.067 --> 01:38:05.687
"What we call homicide or rape," he said,

01:38:05.687 --> 01:38:09.087
"Is very, very common among
different kinds of animals.

01:38:09.087 --> 01:38:13.287
"Lions, for example, commit
infanticide on a regular basis.

01:38:13.287 --> 01:38:15.797
"Now, are these kinds
of acts to be condoned?

01:38:15.797 --> 01:38:17.577
"I don't even know what that means because

01:38:17.577 --> 01:38:20.267
"the lion doesn't
understand what morality is.

01:38:20.267 --> 01:38:23.650
"Morality," he says, "Is an
invention of human beings."

01:38:23.650 --> 01:38:25.670
It's just a convention that human beings

01:38:25.670 --> 01:38:27.500
have adopted to live together.

01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:29.470
But it has no objectivity.

01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:32.070
And that's what I offer
Mr. Hitchens tonight,

01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:35.840
is a solid, transcendent
foundation for the moral values

01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:38.403
that I think he so
desperately wants to affirm.

01:38:39.650 --> 01:38:41.870
What about the resurrection of Jesus?

01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:44.630
Here he misunderstood
N.T. Wright's argument.

01:38:44.630 --> 01:38:46.970
N.T. Wright's argument
is not that the success

01:38:46.970 --> 01:38:49.380
of Christianity means that it's true,

01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:51.910
that would apply to Islam and Mormonism,

01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:53.910
rather, N.T. Wright's argument is that

01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:56.290
the origin of the disciples' belief that

01:38:56.290 --> 01:39:00.480
God had raised Jesus from
the dead is so un-Jewish,

01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:02.930
it is so uncharacteristic,

01:39:02.930 --> 01:39:06.600
that you have to explain
what would bring them

01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:10.630
to adopt so radical a
mutation of Jewish belief,

01:39:10.630 --> 01:39:14.720
as belief in a dying Messiah
and a rising Messiah.

01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:16.930
And he says the only thing
he can think of that would

01:39:16.930 --> 01:39:19.210
explain this is the empty tomb and

01:39:19.210 --> 01:39:22.000
the post mortem appearances
of Jesus and that's why

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.460
Wright concludes that these have

01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:26.130
a certainty that is comparable to the fall

01:39:26.130 --> 01:39:28.420
of Jerusalem in AD 70.

01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:30.450
So you've gotta get the argument right if

01:39:30.450 --> 01:39:32.960
you're going to deal with it and, in fact,

01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:35.690
I think the only
explanation of these facts

01:39:35.690 --> 01:39:37.930
is the one that the
disciples gave that God

01:39:37.930 --> 01:39:39.660
raised Jesus from the dead.

01:39:39.660 --> 01:39:42.230
Finally, the immediate experience of God

01:39:42.230 --> 01:39:43.340
has remained untouched.

01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:44.683
God is real to me.

01:39:45.690 --> 01:39:47.130
And unless I'm delusional,

01:39:47.130 --> 01:39:49.110
I'm perfectly within my rational rights

01:39:49.110 --> 01:39:52.440
to believe in God on the
basis of this experience

01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:55.730
just as I believe in the
reality of the external world

01:39:55.730 --> 01:39:59.210
or the reality of the past on
the basis of my experience.

01:39:59.210 --> 01:40:01.560
So I think in sum, we've
got five good reasons

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:04.010
for believing that Christianity is true,

01:40:04.010 --> 01:40:06.430
no reason to think atheism is true

01:40:06.430 --> 01:40:07.960
and therefore I think Christianity

01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:10.300
is clearly the more rational world view.

01:40:11.916 --> 01:40:14.916
[audience applause]

01:40:25.684 --> 01:40:27.990
&gt;&gt; I think, you'll
correct me if I'm wrong,

01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:31.980
it's Tertilian, isn't it,
who says something like,

01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:35.050
it's variously translated
"credo quia absurdum?"

01:40:35.050 --> 01:40:38.480
That the very improbability of the thing,

01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:41.180
the very unlikelihood of
it, the unlikelihood that

01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:43.630
anyone would fabricate
such a thing, for example,

01:40:43.630 --> 01:40:45.490
that a Jew could be brought to believe

01:40:45.490 --> 01:40:49.250
something so extraordinary,
is testimony to its truth.

01:40:49.250 --> 01:40:51.050
I'm sure there can't be
anyone here who doesn't thinks

01:40:51.050 --> 01:40:53.830
that's a little too easy,
a little too facile.

01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:55.890
I myself, for example,
have followed the career

01:40:55.890 --> 01:41:00.650
of a woman known vulgarly in
the media as "Mother Teresa,"

01:41:00.650 --> 01:41:05.190
an Albanian named Agnes
Bojaxhiu, a Catholic fanatic

01:41:05.190 --> 01:41:08.400
operating in the greater Calcutta area,

01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:13.400
and I watched every stage of
her career as a candidate for,

01:41:13.894 --> 01:41:17.560
and then the recipient of, beatification

01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:19.250
and shortly, canonization.

01:41:19.250 --> 01:41:24.223
The canonization will require,
as the Vatican demands,

01:41:25.232 --> 01:41:26.820
the attestation of a miracle performed

01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:29.380
by her posthumous intercession.

01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:31.570
And the miracle's already been announced,

01:41:31.570 --> 01:41:35.460
a woman in Bengal, fortunately
already a devout Catholic,

01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:38.550
by pressing a medal of
Mother Teresa to her stomach,

01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:42.027
made a tumor go away, or so she says.

01:41:42.027 --> 01:41:44.990
All the witnesses to
this have since recanted,

01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:46.980
all the doctors have given
a much better explanation

01:41:46.980 --> 01:41:49.309
of how she was cured of
the swelling and the growth

01:41:49.309 --> 01:41:51.150
and what the medicines were and so forth,

01:41:51.150 --> 01:41:52.620
but they're still stuck with it.

01:41:52.620 --> 01:41:55.780
They have to go ahead
with this process because,

01:41:55.780 --> 01:41:58.550
which will lead to
countless, untold suffering

01:41:58.550 --> 01:42:00.330
in India because it will appear to license

01:42:00.330 --> 01:42:03.290
the bogus charlatanry of shaman,

01:42:03.290 --> 01:42:06.630
medicine and intercessory medicine rather

01:42:06.630 --> 01:42:07.580
than the real thing.

01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:09.880
All of this will have to be gone through,

01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:13.400
this awful display, in the name of faith.

01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:15.627
And I just happened to have
watched it at every stage

01:42:15.627 --> 01:42:19.260
and I can tell you it's depressingly easy

01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:21.740
to get a religious rumor started.

01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:25.478
You can count on an enormous
amount of pre-existing

01:42:25.478 --> 01:42:29.230
credulity among illiterate, frightened,

01:42:29.230 --> 01:42:30.950
ill-educated populations.

01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:33.960
There isn't a literate, written-down,

01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:38.960
properly attested witness of
any real sort in the Gospels.

01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:41.363
It is, and you may as well
admit it, and stick to it

01:42:41.363 --> 01:42:43.420
because it's what you're good at,

01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:44.730
it involves an act of faith.

01:42:44.730 --> 01:42:47.190
Second, on the matter
of my moral question.

01:42:47.190 --> 01:42:50.680
Yes, it's true that Doug
Wilson said that tithing was

01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:52.840
something I couldn't
do, but then not just,

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:54.560
I'm not moving the goal posts here,

01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:56.590
I don't think I'd regard
giving all my money

01:42:56.590 --> 01:42:59.043
to the New Saint Andrews
church as a moral act.

01:43:00.727 --> 01:43:02.480
The only challenge that I've had so far

01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:04.610
that I really couldn't
get out of, I should share

01:43:04.610 --> 01:43:07.970
it with you, was I was told
well you couldn't do this:

01:43:07.970 --> 01:43:10.617
You couldn't say, "Father, forgive them

01:43:10.617 --> 01:43:12.550
"for they know not what they do."

01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:16.130
No, but nor could you as people
of faith, you wouldn't dare.

01:43:16.130 --> 01:43:17.730
It would be blasphemy to do it.

01:43:17.730 --> 01:43:19.920
There's only one person
who can do that even

01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:21.960
on your account so, with respect,

01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:25.090
ladies and gentlemen, I think
both my challenges stand.

01:43:25.090 --> 01:43:27.870
It hasn't been shown that I couldn't be

01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:29.147
a moral person despite my unbelief

01:43:29.147 --> 01:43:31.560
and it has certainly not been demonstrated

01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:34.663
that unbelief with guarantee you against,

01:43:36.690 --> 01:43:39.370
excuse me that the belief will,

01:43:39.370 --> 01:43:42.410
I'll say it again, that unbelief

01:43:42.410 --> 01:43:44.403
will ensure you against wickedness.

01:43:45.250 --> 01:43:48.430
You mentioned things like
apartheid and Nazism.

01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:50.700
Well, let me just run it by you.

01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:52.667
Partly this often comes
up because people say,

01:43:52.667 --> 01:43:56.000
"What about the crimes and
wickedness of the secular world?"

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.480
The apartheid system in South Africa

01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:00.030
was actually a creation of
the Dutch Reformed Church.

01:44:00.030 --> 01:44:02.350
It was justified
theologically as the giving

01:44:02.350 --> 01:44:05.130
of a promised land to one
Christian religious tribe

01:44:05.130 --> 01:44:06.440
in which everyone else was supposed

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.450
to be hewers of wood and drawers of water.

01:44:08.450 --> 01:44:10.290
It wasn't until the Dutch Reformed Church,

01:44:10.290 --> 01:44:12.690
under pressure, agreed
to drop their racist

01:44:12.690 --> 01:44:15.100
preachments of many years
that the apartheid system

01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:16.460
could be dismantled.

01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:20.600
The dictatorship in
Greece in 1967 to '74 was

01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:22.187
proclaimed by the Greek
Orthodox Church as a

01:44:22.187 --> 01:44:24.050
"Greece for Christian Greeks."

01:44:24.050 --> 01:44:25.660
The Russian Orthodox Church at present,

01:44:25.660 --> 01:44:27.070
maybe this is one of
the churches you don't

01:44:27.070 --> 01:44:29.430
recognize as Christian, I don't know,

01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:31.280
but it's currently become the body guard

01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:34.210
of the Vladimir Putin
dictatorship in Russia.

01:44:34.210 --> 01:44:36.640
They are now producing, the
Russian Orthodox Church,

01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:40.790
actual icons with halos
around them of Joseph Stalin

01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:43.360
for distribution to extreme
Russian nationalists

01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:46.760
and chauvinists for whom
the church has become

01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:49.970
the spiritual sword and butler.

01:44:49.970 --> 01:44:52.960
In Nazi Germany prayers
were said every year

01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:56.260
on the Führer's birthday
by order of the churches

01:44:56.260 --> 01:44:59.420
for his survival and well being.

01:44:59.420 --> 01:45:03.180
The first concordat signed
by Hitler and by Mussolini,

01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:06.550
in both cases, was with the Vatican.

01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:11.550
If you take out the word
"fascist" from any account

01:45:12.890 --> 01:45:15.990
of the 1920s and '30s, any
reputable historical account,

01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:18.050
and you insert the words
"Christian right wing,"

01:45:18.050 --> 01:45:19.550
or actually "Catholic right wing,"

01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:22.610
you don't have to change a word
of the rest of the sentence.

01:45:22.610 --> 01:45:26.070
And the third member of the
axis, the Japanese Empire,

01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:29.070
was led by someone who
actually claimed he was himself

01:45:29.070 --> 01:45:33.368
a god and to whom everyone
in Japan was a serf

01:45:33.368 --> 01:45:37.030
and had to admit his god had
indivinity and it was said

01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:39.577
to all of them, "Where would
we know without the Emperor?

01:45:39.577 --> 01:45:41.047
"How would we know what to do?

01:45:41.047 --> 01:45:42.757
"How would we know what
a right action was?

01:45:42.757 --> 01:45:46.077
"Without him there would
be screwing in the streets.

01:45:46.077 --> 01:45:48.877
"There would be chaos, no one
would know their bearings.

01:45:48.877 --> 01:45:50.800
"Without our god, we would be rudderless."

01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:52.673
Many Japanese people, in fact,

01:45:53.804 --> 01:45:57.440
it is pitiful to report,
still actually believe that.

01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:02.200
Now, I want to say, in
other words, that religion

01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:04.830
is the outcome of
unresolved contradictions

01:46:04.830 --> 01:46:07.780
in the material world, that
if you make the assumption

01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:11.330
that it's man-made then very few things

01:46:11.330 --> 01:46:13.030
are mysterious to you.

01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:15.520
If you make the assumption
that religion is man-made

01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:17.930
then you would know why.

01:46:17.930 --> 01:46:21.700
It would be obvious to you why
there are so many religions.

01:46:21.700 --> 01:46:23.970
When you make the assumption
that it's man-made you

01:46:23.970 --> 01:46:26.310
will understand why it is
that religion has been such

01:46:26.310 --> 01:46:28.350
a disappointment to our
species that despite

01:46:28.350 --> 01:46:30.840
enumerable revivals,

01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:33.140
enumerable attempts again
to preach the truth,

01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:35.200
enumerable attempts to
convert the heathen,

01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:37.540
enumerable attempt to send missionaries

01:46:37.540 --> 01:46:41.560
all around the world, that the
same problems remain with us.

01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:43.400
That nothing is resolved by this.

01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:47.270
That we, if all religions died out

01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:49.680
or all were admitted
to be false instead of,

01:46:49.680 --> 01:46:52.410
as all believers will tell you,
only some of them are false,

01:46:52.410 --> 01:46:54.480
in other words, we're
faced with the preposterous

01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:58.180
proposition that religion,
either all of them true,

01:46:58.180 --> 01:47:01.180
or none of them true, or
only one exclusive preachment

01:47:01.180 --> 01:47:02.013
is true.

01:47:02.013 --> 01:47:04.110
And none of these seem, to me, coherent,

01:47:04.110 --> 01:47:07.410
and all of these seem to be
the outcome of a man-made cult.

01:47:07.410 --> 01:47:10.030
Assume that all of them were
discredited at the same time,

01:47:10.030 --> 01:47:13.270
all of our problems would be
exactly what they are now:

01:47:13.270 --> 01:47:14.940
How do we live with one another?

01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:17.850
Where, indeed, do morals
and ethics come from?

01:47:17.850 --> 01:47:19.310
What are our duties to one another?

01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:21.660
How shall we build the just city?

01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:23.830
How shall we practice love?

01:47:23.830 --> 01:47:26.740
How shall we deal with the baser,

01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:29.277
what Darwin called the "Lowly stamp of

01:47:29.277 --> 01:47:31.950
"our original origins," which comes,

01:47:31.950 --> 01:47:35.420
not from a pact with the
devil, or an original sin,

01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:36.930
but from our evolution as well?

01:47:36.930 --> 01:47:38.640
All these questions, ladies and gentlemen,

01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:40.300
would remain exactly the same.

01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:43.450
Emancipate yourself from
the idea of a celestial

01:47:43.450 --> 01:47:45.470
dictatorship and you've
taken the first step

01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:46.370
to becoming free.

01:47:46.370 --> 01:47:47.203
Thank you.

01:47:48.104 --> 01:47:51.104
[audience applause]

01:47:55.230 --> 01:47:57.410
&gt;&gt; Dr. Craig, your closing argument.

01:47:57.410 --> 01:47:58.243
Five minutes.

01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:09.720
&gt;&gt; In my final speech I'd like to try

01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:11.872
to draw together some of
the threads of this debate

01:48:11.872 --> 01:48:15.040
and see if we can come
to some conclusions.

01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:17.770
First, have we seen any
good arguments tonight

01:48:17.770 --> 01:48:20.170
to think that God does not exist?

01:48:20.170 --> 01:48:21.640
No, I don't think we have.

01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:26.640
We've heard attacks upon
religion, Christianity impugned,

01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:29.850
God impugned, Mother Teresa impugned,

01:48:29.850 --> 01:48:33.483
but we haven't heard any
arguments that God does not exist.

01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:37.319
Mr. Hitchens seems to fail
to recognize that atheism is

01:48:37.319 --> 01:48:41.860
itself a world view and
it claims alone to be true

01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:44.650
and all the other religions
of the world false.

01:48:44.650 --> 01:48:47.400
It is no more tolerant than Christianity,

01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:49.110
with respect to these other views.

01:48:49.110 --> 01:48:54.110
He asserts that he alone has
the true world view: atheism.

01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:56.269
The only problem is he
doesn't have any arguments

01:48:56.269 --> 01:48:59.650
for this world view, he just asserts it.

01:48:59.650 --> 01:49:02.680
So it seems to me that
if you're going to have

01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:04.840
a world view and champion
it tonight you've got

01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:07.220
to come to a debate prepared
to give some arguments

01:49:07.220 --> 01:49:08.320
and we haven't heard any.

01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:11.160
He did have an argument
about evolution but when

01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:13.500
I explained that it
actually turned out to be

01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:16.030
supportive of theism,
evolution actually provides

01:49:16.030 --> 01:49:19.260
evidence for the existence of
a designer of the universe,

01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:21.200
so we've not heard any
good arguments to think

01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:22.700
that atheism is true.

01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:25.880
Now, I've presented five
reasons to think that

01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:28.640
theism is true and this is what God,

01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:31.010
or the god hypothesis does give you.

01:49:31.010 --> 01:49:32.760
He asks, "What does it give us?"

01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:36.870
It explains a broad range
of human experience,

01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:40.630
philosophical, ethical, scientific,

01:49:40.630 --> 01:49:42.980
historical, experiential.

01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:45.765
I find the attraction of
the god hypothesis is that

01:49:45.765 --> 01:49:50.765
it is so powerful in making
sense of the way the world is.

01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:54.680
For example, the god
hypothesis explains the origins

01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:56.130
of the universe.

01:49:56.130 --> 01:49:58.610
Mr. Hitchens has completed
dropped this point

01:49:58.610 --> 01:49:59.990
in tonight's debate.

01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:01.920
When we saw that in fact scientific

01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:04.600
and philosophical evidence
points to a beginning

01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:07.010
of the universe out of
nothing and therefore

01:50:07.010 --> 01:50:10.630
to a transcendent, personal
creator of the cosmos.

01:50:10.630 --> 01:50:12.580
The teleological argument.

01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:15.450
The fine tuning that is
established in the initial

01:50:15.450 --> 01:50:16.930
conditions of the universe,

01:50:16.930 --> 01:50:19.590
not to speak of in the
biological complexity

01:50:19.590 --> 01:50:20.470
that then ensued.

01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:23.000
And again, Mr. Hitchens has dropped that

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:24.750
in the course of the debate tonight.

01:50:24.750 --> 01:50:27.310
So we have a creator and
an intelligent designer

01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:28.740
of the cosmos.

01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:29.573
Thirdly, the moral argument.

01:50:29.573 --> 01:50:34.550
We saw that without God there
are no objective moral values.

01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:37.860
And here Mr. Hitchens has
consistently distorted

01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:38.693
the argument.

01:50:38.693 --> 01:50:40.087
He's portrayed the argument as,

01:50:40.087 --> 01:50:44.027
"How would we know moral values
if we didn't believe in God?

01:50:44.027 --> 01:50:46.317
"We don't need to believe
in a tyrant in order

01:50:46.317 --> 01:50:47.757
"to define moral values.

01:50:47.757 --> 01:50:50.390
"Unbelief doesn't produce wickedness."

01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:52.290
That is all irrelevant.

01:50:52.290 --> 01:50:55.810
The point is that there is no foundation

01:50:55.810 --> 01:50:59.020
on a naturalistic world
view for the moral values

01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:01.270
and duties that we both want to affirm

01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:02.370
and he agrees with that.

01:51:02.370 --> 01:51:04.897
This is what he says and I quote, he says,

01:51:04.897 --> 01:51:07.067
"Our innate predisposition to both good

01:51:07.067 --> 01:51:10.017
"and wicked behavior is
precisely what one would

01:51:10.017 --> 01:51:12.917
"expect to find of a
recently evolved species

01:51:12.917 --> 01:51:16.037
"that is half a chromosome
away from chimpanzees.

01:51:16.037 --> 01:51:19.807
"Primate and elephant
and even pig societies

01:51:19.807 --> 01:51:22.657
"show considerable evidence
of care for others,

01:51:22.657 --> 01:51:26.677
"parent-child bonding,
solidarity in the face of danger,

01:51:26.677 --> 01:51:27.510
"and so on.

01:51:27.510 --> 01:51:30.347
"As Darwin put it, any
animal, whatever endowed

01:51:30.347 --> 01:51:32.387
"with well-marked social instincts,

01:51:32.387 --> 01:51:35.627
"would inevitably acquire
a moral censor conscience

01:51:35.627 --> 01:51:37.907
"as soon as its intellectual
powers had become

01:51:37.907 --> 01:51:40.430
"as well developed as in man."

01:51:40.430 --> 01:51:43.550
That is the socio-biological
explanation for morality.

01:51:43.550 --> 01:51:46.510
The problem is that that
moral sense that develops

01:51:46.510 --> 01:51:49.640
in pig societies, chimpanzees, baboons,

01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:53.560
and Homo sapiens is
illusory on atheism because

01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:56.450
there are no objective
moral duties or values

01:51:56.450 --> 01:51:59.490
that we have to fulfill
and that's what the theist

01:51:59.490 --> 01:52:01.030
can offer Mr. Hitchens.

01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:03.360
And so, I want to invite Mr. Hitchens

01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:06.153
to think about becoming
a Christian tonight.

01:52:07.770 --> 01:52:12.720
[audience laughing]
[applause]

01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:16.050
Honestly, if he is a man
of good will who will

01:52:16.050 --> 01:52:17.450
follow the evidence where it leads,

01:52:17.450 --> 01:52:19.810
all of the evidence tonight
has been on one side

01:52:19.810 --> 01:52:22.600
of the scale and he
wants to affirm objective

01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:25.910
moral values so why not adopt theism?

01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:29.020
The resurrection of
Jesus has gone unrefuted.

01:52:29.020 --> 01:52:31.400
The argument is not
that it's too improbable

01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:33.870
to be false, the argument is that you need

01:52:33.870 --> 01:52:37.330
a historically sufficient
explanation to explain

01:52:37.330 --> 01:52:40.230
why the disciples came
to believe this and there

01:52:40.230 --> 01:52:43.100
isn't one apart from the
empty tomb and appearances.

01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:45.520
It's not a matter of rumor
because the empty tomb

01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:48.220
was public knowledge in Jerusalem.

01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:50.030
It would impossible for Christianity

01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:53.990
to flourish in Jerusalem in
the face of an occupied tomb.

01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:56.750
Finally, the immediate experience of God.

01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:58.510
If there's anyone watching or listening

01:52:58.510 --> 01:53:00.930
to the debate tonight who hasn't found God

01:53:00.930 --> 01:53:03.100
in a personal experiential way then I want

01:53:03.100 --> 01:53:06.230
to invite you as well to think
about becoming a Christian.

01:53:06.230 --> 01:53:09.010
I became a Christian as
a junior in high school

01:53:09.010 --> 01:53:11.190
and it changed my entire life

01:53:11.190 --> 01:53:13.430
and I believe that if
you'll look into it honestly

01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:15.620
with an open mind and
an open heart that it

01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:17.793
can change your life as well.

01:53:19.325 --> 01:53:24.325
[audience applause]
[cheering]

01:53:36.890 --> 01:53:38.800
&gt;&gt; Mr. Hitchens has yielded his time

01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:41.240
and therefore we move to questions

01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:43.830
and we are directing those
questions to students tonight.

01:53:43.830 --> 01:53:46.710
I want to repeat something Dr. Hazen said.

01:53:46.710 --> 01:53:50.052
There are stupid questions.
[audience laughing]

01:53:50.052 --> 01:53:52.450
I want to add to it we are
uninterested in your opinions.

01:53:52.450 --> 01:53:55.500
Only your questions matter to us.

01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:57.380
I don't know where the
microphone is can we hear

01:53:57.380 --> 01:53:58.330
the first question?

01:53:58.330 --> 01:54:00.703
Each participant will
answer every question.

01:54:02.850 --> 01:54:04.750
&gt;&gt; Dr. Craig, Mr. Hitchens,
thank you so much.

01:54:04.750 --> 01:54:06.830
It's been great listening to you both.

01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:08.573
My question is for Mr. Hitchens.

01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:13.107
Mr. Hitchens, in your book God
is Not Great, you say that,

01:54:13.107 --> 01:54:14.797
"There are four irreducible objections

01:54:14.797 --> 01:54:16.187
"to religious faith."

01:54:17.140 --> 01:54:18.877
The third being that religious faith

01:54:18.877 --> 01:54:21.307
"Is both the result and the cause

01:54:21.307 --> 01:54:23.527
"of dangerous sexual repression."

01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:26.840
So here's my question for you:

01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:28.444
Is it good that the Bible prohibits humans

01:54:28.444 --> 01:54:30.790
from having sex with animals,

01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:33.563
or is that an example of
dangerous sexual repression?

01:54:35.580 --> 01:54:38.823
&gt;&gt; Um.
[audience laughing]

01:54:41.070 --> 01:54:45.260
The allusion I was making
was not to the man-made,

01:54:45.260 --> 01:54:47.510
in the ordinary sense nature of religion,

01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:50.660
that you can tell from
studying some of its codes

01:54:50.660 --> 01:54:52.600
that it's, humans have invented it.

01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:55.140
That's why so many of the injunctions

01:54:55.140 --> 01:54:57.287
in the Old Testament are
as you quite rightly say,

01:54:57.287 --> 01:55:00.037
concerned with agriculture,
shall we put it delicately?

01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:04.980
But, it's more that it's man-made,

01:55:04.980 --> 01:55:09.530
it's designed to keep
women in subordination.

01:55:09.530 --> 01:55:10.980
&gt;&gt; Man: But could you answer the question?

01:55:10.980 --> 01:55:12.275
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:55:12.275 --> 01:55:13.990
&gt;&gt; Do you think the Bible
is right to prohibit humans

01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:15.440
from having sex with animals?

01:55:16.290 --> 01:55:18.750
&gt;&gt; I don't know of any good advice about

01:55:18.750 --> 01:55:21.050
having sex with animals, in
favor of it, I mean to say.

01:55:21.050 --> 01:55:23.330
Look, there are things that if people do,

01:55:23.330 --> 01:55:26.700
incest is one and cannibalism is another,

01:55:26.700 --> 01:55:28.510
if you do them, you'll die out.

01:55:28.510 --> 01:55:30.740
A society that permitted it would.

01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:31.940
There were societies in New Guinea

01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:35.580
that did practice cannibalism
and there's a terrible

01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:37.500
disease that you get
called Kuru if you do it

01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:40.300
and it seems to me, if you like,

01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:42.550
there are some rules
that are self-enforcing.

01:55:44.530 --> 01:55:46.080
That's not what I, when I was talking

01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:47.597
about sexual repression,
I was talking about

01:55:47.597 --> 01:55:51.140
the enormous number of prohibitions on

01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:53.980
sex between men and women
and on the evident fear

01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:58.270
of female sexuality and
the superstitious dread,

01:55:58.270 --> 01:56:00.380
for example, of female menstrual blood.

01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:01.520
Things of this kind.

01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:04.810
&gt;&gt; Dr. Craig, your assessment
of that question and answer.

01:56:04.810 --> 01:56:07.460
&gt;&gt; Well, I think the
question illustrates that,

01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:11.773
apart from God, whatever
is in nature is right.

01:56:12.780 --> 01:56:16.260
There is no thing barred in nature

01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:19.650
if there is no sort of
objective moral code.

01:56:19.650 --> 01:56:22.790
So, the question is a good one because

01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:25.970
it illustrates that here is a guideline

01:56:25.970 --> 01:56:28.130
for sexual expression that is very good

01:56:28.130 --> 01:56:30.330
for human beings and not something that's

01:56:30.330 --> 01:56:34.130
meant to be repressive or
harmful to human beings.

01:56:34.130 --> 01:56:36.590
In fact, the studies I've seen says that

01:56:36.590 --> 01:56:39.370
religious people have more fun with sex

01:56:39.370 --> 01:56:42.260
than people who are not religious

01:56:42.260 --> 01:56:44.900
and it's actually shows that they are more

01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:47.690
sexually satisfied in
marriage and so forth.

01:56:47.690 --> 01:56:50.610
So I think the question
makes a good point.

01:56:50.610 --> 01:56:52.960
&gt;&gt; I think I have to have
another bite at this--

01:56:54.488 --> 01:56:57.640
[audience laughing]

01:56:57.640 --> 01:56:59.310
This tempting cherry.

01:56:59.310 --> 01:57:03.820
You see, if it's true
that, as I think it is,

01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:06.050
that nature is pretty
indifferent, pretty callous,

01:57:06.050 --> 01:57:08.920
pretty random, then who is the designer?

01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:11.810
Many people say, concerning
the ban on homosexuality,

01:57:11.810 --> 01:57:14.417
for example, in the Old
Testament, they'll say,

01:57:14.417 --> 01:57:16.097
"Well, homosexuality is against God's law

01:57:16.097 --> 01:57:17.970
"and against Nature's law."

01:57:17.970 --> 01:57:20.353
Well, in that case, why
does nature see to it

01:57:20.353 --> 01:57:23.310
that so many people are born homosexual?

01:57:23.310 --> 01:57:24.990
Or, if you want to rephrase it,

01:57:24.990 --> 01:57:26.868
why does God have so many of his children

01:57:26.868 --> 01:57:29.003
preferring sex with their own gender?

01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:32.130
It doesn't help, it doesn't, in clarifying

01:57:32.130 --> 01:57:33.473
and elucidating this.

01:57:33.473 --> 01:57:36.420
It doesn't help to assume
a supernatural authority.

01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:39.940
Whereas, if you look at the reasons given

01:57:39.940 --> 01:57:43.460
by Maimonides and the other sages for the

01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:47.850
practice of circumcision,
it is precisely to dull

01:57:47.850 --> 01:57:50.750
and to blunt the sensation of an organ

01:57:50.750 --> 01:57:52.163
which I don't think even,

01:57:53.570 --> 01:57:56.300
well, I'll leave it there.
[audience laughing]

01:57:56.300 --> 01:57:57.450
&gt;&gt; Hugh: Our next question.

01:57:57.450 --> 01:57:59.030
&gt;&gt; It's explicitly
designed, in other words,

01:57:59.030 --> 01:58:00.740
to reduce sexual pleasure,

01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:03.333
make it more of a painful
duty than a celebration.

01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:08.510
Well you asked for it.

01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:10.670
&gt;&gt; I don't want to misrepresent myself.

01:58:10.670 --> 01:58:13.577
I was a student here and graduated--

01:58:14.557 --> 01:58:17.557
[audience laughing]

01:58:19.470 --> 01:58:21.323
Somewhat by the skin of my teeth.

01:58:22.850 --> 01:58:26.510
Mr. Hitchens you stated that, some of your

01:58:26.510 --> 01:58:30.920
most strongly stated arguments are that

01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:35.920
the results of religion,
violence, death, destruction,

01:58:37.130 --> 01:58:39.413
the motivation being religion,

01:58:40.540 --> 01:58:45.540
discredit those who would
promote a belief in God.

01:58:47.020 --> 01:58:50.200
However, I think there's
an imbalance there

01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:54.840
in that the nuclear bomb
was created by physicists

01:58:54.840 --> 01:58:59.011
and is the most demonstrable violence

01:58:59.011 --> 01:59:01.240
perpetrated on mankind.

01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:04.540
So I wonder how you respond to that.

01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:06.520
&gt;&gt; Well physics isn't an ideology.

01:59:06.520 --> 01:59:08.060
Physics isn't a belief system.

01:59:08.060 --> 01:59:09.700
It's a science.

01:59:09.700 --> 01:59:11.120
&gt;&gt; Well that, I think
that would be subjective.

01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:13.080
&gt;&gt; I mean you could, any more than

01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:19.020
Marie Curie discovering radium makes

01:59:20.010 --> 01:59:22.470
her practice morally different.

01:59:22.470 --> 01:59:25.890
I mean, it's not comparing like with like.

01:59:25.890 --> 01:59:28.530
What I'm talking about
are specific religious

01:59:28.530 --> 01:59:30.140
injunctions to do evil.

01:59:30.140 --> 01:59:33.494
To mutilate the genitalia
of children, for example.

01:59:33.494 --> 01:59:37.370
To take the pastor, Douglas Wilson,

01:59:37.370 --> 01:59:39.340
who Dr. Craig was just mentioning,

01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:41.180
with whom I've crossed swords
several times this year,

01:59:41.180 --> 01:59:42.710
and recently in Dallas.

01:59:42.710 --> 01:59:44.310
I happened to be mentioning to him about

01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:46.910
the commandment to
exterminate the Amalekites

01:59:46.910 --> 01:59:48.540
in one of our debates and
he said that commandment

01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:49.403
is still valid.

01:59:50.690 --> 01:59:51.890
If there were any Amalekites

01:59:51.890 --> 01:59:53.490
it would be his job to
make sure they were all

01:59:53.490 --> 01:59:57.960
put to the sword and some
of the virgins left over

01:59:57.960 --> 02:00:00.220
for slavery, purposes better imagined

02:00:00.220 --> 02:00:02.070
perhaps than described.

02:00:02.070 --> 02:00:03.690
I think this is a very serious problem.

02:00:03.690 --> 02:00:06.380
I'm not taking refuge in the common place

02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:10.010
that sometimes religious
people behave badly

02:00:10.010 --> 02:00:11.430
and that that would discredit religion.

02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:12.930
That would be a very soft option.

02:00:12.930 --> 02:00:15.520
I'm saying that there
are specific biblical,

02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:17.993
scriptural injunctions to do evil.

02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:21.010
&gt;&gt; Dr. Craig in that regards,

02:00:21.010 --> 02:00:23.990
those who are announced
atheists who have done evil

02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:26.730
in the world particularly
in the last 20th century,

02:00:26.730 --> 02:00:29.990
the Marxists, the
Trotskyites, the Stalinists.

02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:31.660
have they done more damage in your view

02:00:31.660 --> 02:00:33.230
and more evil than Christians?

02:00:33.230 --> 02:00:35.220
&gt;&gt; Well, this is a debate, Hugh,

02:00:35.220 --> 02:00:36.970
that I don't want to get into

02:00:36.970 --> 02:00:38.753
because I think it's irrelevant.

02:00:39.805 --> 02:00:41.940
I, as a philosopher, and I mean this,

02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:46.380
am interested in the
truth of these world views

02:00:46.380 --> 02:00:49.550
more than I'm interested
in the social impact.

02:00:49.550 --> 02:00:52.560
And you cannot judge the
truth of a world view

02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:55.660
by its social impact,
that's just irrelevant.

02:00:55.660 --> 02:00:58.650
Bertrand Russell, in his essay
"Why I'm Not a Christian"

02:00:58.650 --> 02:00:59.483
understood this.

02:00:59.483 --> 02:01:03.080
Russell said you cannot assess the truth

02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:05.540
of a world view by
seeing whether it's good

02:01:05.540 --> 02:01:07.000
for society or not.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.410
Now the irony was when
Russell wrote that back

02:01:09.410 --> 02:01:12.870
in the '20s, he was trying to refute those

02:01:12.870 --> 02:01:16.010
who said that you should
be believe in Christianity

02:01:16.010 --> 02:01:19.130
because it's so socially
beneficial to society.

02:01:19.130 --> 02:01:20.450
It was just the mirror image of

02:01:20.450 --> 02:01:22.070
Christopher Hitchens' argument,

02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:24.230
where he's saying you
shouldn't believe in it because

02:01:24.230 --> 02:01:27.860
it's so socially detrimental
to human culture.

02:01:27.860 --> 02:01:30.470
But I think Russell's point cuts both ways

02:01:30.470 --> 02:01:32.120
because it's a valid point.

02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:34.900
You can't assess the truth of a world view

02:01:34.900 --> 02:01:38.240
by arguing about its
cultural and social impact.

02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:42.020
There are true ideas that may have had

02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:45.350
negative social impact and
therefore we have to deal

02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:46.610
with the truth of these,

02:01:46.610 --> 02:01:48.650
the arguments for and against them

02:01:48.650 --> 02:01:50.730
and not get into arguments about has

02:01:50.730 --> 02:01:54.060
Marxism or Chinese
Communism been responsible

02:01:54.060 --> 02:01:57.100
for more deaths than theism
in the twentieth century?

02:01:57.100 --> 02:01:59.720
&gt;&gt; No, I completely concur
with what you say there.

02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:02.370
I mean, I just wanted to say that I think

02:02:02.370 --> 02:02:05.070
those commandments are
injunctions to do evil

02:02:05.070 --> 02:02:08.100
but I would much prefer
to say that the tribe

02:02:08.100 --> 02:02:10.780
that thought it was hearing
these instructions from God,

02:02:10.780 --> 02:02:13.160
to kill all of its rivals,
exterminate all its rivals

02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:16.070
for the Holy Land,
might possibly have had,

02:02:16.070 --> 02:02:19.140
I think it's overwhelmingly
probable it did have,

02:02:19.140 --> 02:02:22.390
the need to seek and claim divine approval

02:02:22.390 --> 02:02:24.860
for the war of greedy extermination,

02:02:24.860 --> 02:02:27.000
annexation, and racist conquests that

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:28.930
it was going to undertake anyway.

02:02:28.930 --> 02:02:30.700
In other words, I don't think there was

02:02:30.700 --> 02:02:32.800
an authority issuing
that commandment whether

02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:35.023
it was morally good or otherwise,

02:02:35.900 --> 02:02:37.180
as a matter of the truth.

02:02:37.180 --> 02:02:39.980
But I would add, and
I think the concession

02:02:39.980 --> 02:02:41.540
is very well worth having,

02:02:41.540 --> 02:02:42.990
that there is absolutely
no proof at all that

02:02:42.990 --> 02:02:45.370
Christianity makes people behave better.

02:02:45.370 --> 02:02:46.710
&gt;&gt; Wait a minute, I didn't concede that.

02:02:46.710 --> 02:02:49.400
I said I wasn't going to argue that,

02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:52.980
because it's irrelevant but by
no means did I concede that.

02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:55.520
And I do appreciate as
well the way you framed

02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:57.140
the issue the about the Canaanites.

02:02:57.140 --> 02:02:59.370
I think you're quite right in saying

02:02:59.370 --> 02:03:02.860
that this is not an issue about
whether or not God exists.

02:03:02.860 --> 02:03:06.110
Rather this is a question
about biblical inerrancy.

02:03:06.110 --> 02:03:09.090
Did these ancient Israelites
get it right in thinking

02:03:09.090 --> 02:03:12.150
that God had commanded them to
do these things or did they,

02:03:12.150 --> 02:03:13.680
in their nationalistic fervor,

02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:16.520
think God is on our side
and do something which,

02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:19.140
in fact, they weren't
commanded to do by God?

02:03:19.140 --> 02:03:23.340
So that this isn't an issue
between atheism and theism.

02:03:23.340 --> 02:03:25.930
This is an issue about
biblical inspiration

02:03:25.930 --> 02:03:28.980
and inerrancy and that's
an important issue,

02:03:28.980 --> 02:03:33.440
but it's not one that
is on the floor tonight.

02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:35.660
&gt;&gt; Our next student question.

02:03:35.660 --> 02:03:38.830
&gt;&gt; Hi, my question is mainly
directed at Mr. Hitchens, but,

02:03:38.830 --> 02:03:41.200
Christian theism, as with all theisms

02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:43.906
that claim a revelation
say that the purpose

02:03:43.906 --> 02:03:47.290
of human existence is to serve God,

02:03:47.290 --> 02:03:51.200
and Dr. Craig might want to
expound on that in some way.

02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:54.100
But Mr. Hitchens, as an atheist with no

02:03:54.100 --> 02:03:57.640
transcendent being giving
you a reason for existence,

02:03:57.640 --> 02:04:00.300
what then is the best way to live life

02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:02.850
or what is motivation for living life

02:04:02.850 --> 02:04:05.680
or what is the purpose of your existence

02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:08.280
without a transcendent being
telling you what to do?

02:04:09.636 --> 02:04:10.890
&gt;&gt; Well I find it, you
see this is where I find

02:04:12.484 --> 02:04:14.070
it hard to accept the
grammar of your question.

02:04:14.070 --> 02:04:16.667
It's as if, if I was
only willing to concede

02:04:16.667 --> 02:04:20.190
the supernatural, you
want to say transcendent,

02:04:20.190 --> 02:04:22.880
I want to say supernatural,
then my life would have purpose.

02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:25.043
I think that's a complete non sequitur.

02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:28.680
To me, at any rate, I'll have
to just make the confession.

02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:30.880
This is as real to me subjectively

02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:34.400
as any William Jamesian
apprehension of the divine.

02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:37.013
I don't get your point at all.

02:04:38.670 --> 02:04:40.750
&gt;&gt; Dr. Craig, one of the
written questions says,

02:04:40.750 --> 02:04:42.530
and I think it is
consistent with the question

02:04:42.530 --> 02:04:43.507
from the audience:

02:04:43.507 --> 02:04:45.913
"You've written that life
without God is absurd,

02:04:47.187 --> 02:04:48.697
"but I know unbelievers who are living

02:04:48.697 --> 02:04:50.077
"fulfilling moral lives.

02:04:50.077 --> 02:04:52.360
"In what way is their life absurd?"

02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:55.410
&gt;&gt; Okay, let me respond to
that and to the question,

02:04:55.410 --> 02:04:56.243
here that was asked.

02:04:56.243 --> 02:04:59.310
I would say that the purpose of life,

02:04:59.310 --> 02:05:00.580
for which God has created us,

02:05:00.580 --> 02:05:02.520
is not to serve God.

02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:05.557
Remember, Jesus said, "I
have not called you servants,

02:05:05.557 --> 02:05:07.500
"I have called you friends."

02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:09.750
And I think the Westminster
Confession gets it right

02:05:09.750 --> 02:05:11.650
when it says the purpose
of human existence

02:05:11.650 --> 02:05:16.160
is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever.

02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:18.640
God is the fulfillment of human existence.

02:05:18.640 --> 02:05:21.130
It is in fellowship eternally with God,

02:05:21.130 --> 02:05:23.710
the source of infinite goodness and love,

02:05:23.710 --> 02:05:26.796
that the true fulfillment
of human existence

02:05:26.796 --> 02:05:29.410
and freedom is to be found.

02:05:29.410 --> 02:05:34.070
Now, when I say that, apart from theism,

02:05:34.070 --> 02:05:38.110
life is meaningless, I mean
objectively meaningless.

02:05:38.110 --> 02:05:40.520
This is the same distinction
that we're talking

02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:42.740
about with regard to moral values.

02:05:42.740 --> 02:05:44.470
I'm saying that on atheism,

02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:49.470
there is there is no objective
purpose for human existence.

02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:51.120
As Mr. Hitchens recognizes,

02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:56.120
eventually the universe will
grow cold, dilute, dark,

02:05:57.550 --> 02:06:01.120
and dead as it runs down
toward maximum entropy

02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:04.380
and heat death and all human existence

02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:09.380
and life will be extinguished
on an atheistic view

02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:10.750
of the future of the universe.

02:06:10.750 --> 02:06:13.320
There is no purpose for
which the universe exists;

02:06:13.320 --> 02:06:16.080
the litter of a dead
universe will just expand

02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:18.090
into the endless darkness forever,

02:06:18.090 --> 02:06:19.860
a universe in ruins.

02:06:19.860 --> 02:06:22.859
Now, of course one can
still live one's life

02:06:22.859 --> 02:06:25.027
as an illusion, thinking,

02:06:25.027 --> 02:06:28.067
"Well, the purpose of life is to, say,

02:06:28.067 --> 02:06:31.107
"hit forty home runs and
steal 40 bases every year,

02:06:31.107 --> 02:06:32.380
"you know, in the major leagues,"

02:06:32.380 --> 02:06:34.630
and you draw the meaning of your existence

02:06:34.630 --> 02:06:36.440
from that but that's
not really the meaning

02:06:36.440 --> 02:06:39.960
of your existence, that's
just a subjective illusion.

02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:42.054
In fact, your existence on atheism

02:06:42.054 --> 02:06:45.250
is objectively meaningless.

02:06:45.250 --> 02:06:47.610
So that's the distinction
that I was making.

02:06:47.610 --> 02:06:51.343
Again, it's between objective
and mere subjective illusion.

02:06:52.940 --> 02:06:57.710
&gt;&gt; Well, I think it has it
exactly the wrong way around.

02:06:57.710 --> 02:07:00.140
You see, as I was
beginning to say earlier,

02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:01.960
we didn't have time in
the question period,

02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:04.670
I wouldn't say that atheism
was morally inferior,

02:07:04.670 --> 02:07:05.970
I wouldn't concede that for a second.

02:07:05.970 --> 02:07:09.530
I don't want to make a claim
for its superiority either,

02:07:09.530 --> 02:07:11.810
but there may be a slight edge here.

02:07:11.810 --> 02:07:14.693
We don't believe anything
that could be called wishful.

02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:18.050
In other words, we don't
particularly welcome

02:07:18.050 --> 02:07:21.540
the idea of the annihilation
either of ourselves,

02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:22.373
as individuals.

02:07:22.373 --> 02:07:24.590
The party will go one, we will have left

02:07:24.590 --> 02:07:26.430
and we're not coming back.

02:07:26.430 --> 02:07:29.273
Or of the entropic heat
death of the universe.

02:07:29.273 --> 02:07:31.270
We don't like the idea,

02:07:31.270 --> 02:07:33.070
but there's a good deal
of evidence to suggest

02:07:33.070 --> 02:07:34.710
that is what's gonna happen.

02:07:34.710 --> 02:07:37.120
And there's very, very
little evidence to suggest

02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:40.673
that I'll see you all
again in some theme park.

02:07:42.690 --> 02:07:45.210
One nice and one nasty experience.

02:07:45.210 --> 02:07:47.170
There's absolutely no
evidence for that at all.

02:07:47.170 --> 02:07:49.960
So I'm willing to accept
on the evidence conclusions

02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:51.920
that may be unwelcome to me.

02:07:51.920 --> 02:07:55.080
I'm sorry if I sound as
if I'm spelling that out,

02:07:55.080 --> 02:07:55.990
but I will.

02:07:55.990 --> 02:07:58.290
Now you want to know what
makes my life meaningful?

02:07:58.290 --> 02:08:01.720
Generally speaking it's
been struggling myself

02:08:01.720 --> 02:08:04.150
to be free and, if I can
say it without immodesty,

02:08:04.150 --> 02:08:06.330
Mr. Hewitt kindly said it for me,

02:08:06.330 --> 02:08:09.190
too flatteringly beforehand,

02:08:09.190 --> 02:08:11.240
but trying to help others to be free too.

02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:15.057
That's what's given a
lot of meaning to my life

02:08:15.057 --> 02:08:16.230
and does still.

02:08:16.230 --> 02:08:21.230
Solidarity with those who
want to be as free as I am,

02:08:22.290 --> 02:08:25.285
partly by luck and partly by my own

02:08:25.285 --> 02:08:26.980
efforts and the efforts of others.

02:08:26.980 --> 02:08:30.010
Well one obstacle to liberty,

02:08:30.010 --> 02:08:32.020
and that's why I mentioned it

02:08:32.020 --> 02:08:33.920
and gave so many examples of it in history

02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:35.430
and in the present day,

02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:38.190
is the poisonous role
played by fellow primates

02:08:38.190 --> 02:08:41.064
of mine who think they
can tell me what to do

02:08:41.064 --> 02:08:43.470
in the name of God because God's told them

02:08:43.470 --> 02:08:45.470
that they have this power.

02:08:45.470 --> 02:08:49.550
So, that's one thing I'd
like to be shot of right here

02:08:49.550 --> 02:08:50.383
in the here in now.

02:08:50.383 --> 02:08:53.050
And my suspicion is, if you
really ask the religious

02:08:53.050 --> 02:08:55.480
whether they want power
and what's the world

02:08:55.480 --> 02:08:58.040
they care about, the next one or this one,

02:08:58.040 --> 02:08:59.940
it'll be this one every time,

02:08:59.940 --> 02:09:02.143
because they too know perfectly well

02:09:02.143 --> 02:09:04.720
that this is the only life we've got.

02:09:04.720 --> 02:09:06.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't think that's true.

02:09:06.020 --> 02:09:07.173
It seems to me that,

02:09:08.820 --> 02:09:11.210
on the basis of the resurrection of Jesus

02:09:11.210 --> 02:09:14.840
that we have grounds for
the hope of immortality.

02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:16.860
This is the foundation upon which the

02:09:16.860 --> 02:09:18.690
Christian hope is predicated.

02:09:18.690 --> 02:09:21.450
So, again, it gets back to whether or not

02:09:21.450 --> 02:09:24.350
one has good grounds for thinking

02:09:24.350 --> 02:09:25.700
that Jesus was who he claimed to be

02:09:25.700 --> 02:09:27.770
and that God raised him from the dead

02:09:27.770 --> 02:09:32.210
because if he did, then
there is hope of immortality.

02:09:32.210 --> 02:09:35.350
&gt;&gt; But then, I return your question to me,

02:09:35.350 --> 02:09:37.540
I return it to you in a different form.

02:09:37.540 --> 02:09:40.840
If there's going to be a resurrection,

02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:42.850
an ingathering, if in the
end all the injustices

02:09:42.850 --> 02:09:45.250
will be canceled, all tears dried,

02:09:45.250 --> 02:09:46.420
all the other promises kept,

02:09:46.420 --> 02:09:48.970
then why do you care what
happens in this brief

02:09:48.970 --> 02:09:49.803
veil of tears?

02:09:49.803 --> 02:09:51.500
Why do the churches want
power in the here and now?

02:09:51.500 --> 02:09:53.850
Why do they want to
legislate for things like

02:09:53.850 --> 02:09:56.360
abortion or sexuality or morality?

02:09:56.360 --> 02:09:57.390
Why bother?

02:09:57.390 --> 02:10:00.100
I mean, isn't it just as much the case,

02:10:00.100 --> 02:10:02.300
as Dostoyevsky says about atheism,

02:10:02.300 --> 02:10:04.940
that without God all things are possible,

02:10:04.940 --> 02:10:07.310
that with God all things
are thinkable too?

02:10:07.310 --> 02:10:08.230
&gt;&gt; Not at all.

02:10:08.230 --> 02:10:11.700
As Dostoyevsky said, if
there is no immortality,

02:10:11.700 --> 02:10:13.810
all things are permitted, he said,

02:10:13.810 --> 02:10:15.430
because it all ends up the same,

02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:17.650
it all comes out in the wash the same.

02:10:17.650 --> 02:10:19.920
But, if there is a God who exists,

02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:22.140
who loves human beings
and has created them

02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:25.830
in his image and endowed them
with intrinsic moral value

02:10:25.830 --> 02:10:27.840
and unalienable rights,

02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:32.010
then you have every reason
to treasure other persons

02:10:32.010 --> 02:10:33.720
as ends in themselves.

02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:36.937
And the desire of pro-life

02:10:38.710 --> 02:10:41.820
persons to champion
the lives of the unborn

02:10:41.820 --> 02:10:45.750
or the lives of the
dying isn't a power grab,

02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:48.180
Mr. Hitchens, it's because they genuinely

02:10:48.180 --> 02:10:51.870
care about the lives of
innocent human beings

02:10:51.870 --> 02:10:55.203
that they believe are
being wantonly destroyed.

02:10:56.498 --> 02:10:57.598
[audience applause]

02:10:57.598 --> 02:10:59.483
So it's a very positive motivation.

02:11:03.590 --> 02:11:05.019
&gt;&gt; Agreed, agreed, but there are perfectly

02:11:05.019 --> 02:11:07.967
good humanist motives for
doing all those things

02:11:07.967 --> 02:11:10.200
and if you want to have
a reason for caring

02:11:10.200 --> 02:11:12.510
about the survival and health
and well being of others,

02:11:12.510 --> 02:11:14.150
the idea that you might depend on them

02:11:14.150 --> 02:11:15.620
for the only life you've got,

02:11:15.620 --> 02:11:17.550
and they on you for solidarity,

02:11:17.550 --> 02:11:20.790
is just as good an
explanation for right action.

02:11:20.790 --> 02:11:21.641
&gt;&gt; William: Now don't you--

02:11:21.641 --> 02:11:25.510
&gt;&gt; Par contre, if people
think God is telling

02:11:25.510 --> 02:11:29.250
them what to do, or they
have God on their side,

02:11:29.250 --> 02:11:30.910
what will they not do?

02:11:30.910 --> 02:11:32.380
That's what I meant by the reverse of

02:11:32.380 --> 02:11:33.500
the Dostoyevsky question.

02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:35.500
What crime will not be committed?

02:11:35.500 --> 02:11:39.500
What offense to justice
and to reason will not be,

02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:42.310
is not regularly committed
by people who are convinced

02:11:42.310 --> 02:11:44.689
that it is God's will that they do that?

02:11:44.689 --> 02:11:45.663
It's with God that all is possible.

02:11:45.663 --> 02:11:46.500
&gt;&gt; If they commit such
atrocities it is only

02:11:46.500 --> 02:11:48.480
because they only act inconsistently

02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:50.690
with their world view
rather than in line with it.

02:11:50.690 --> 02:11:53.880
Jesus would not have
been a guard at Auschwitz

02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:58.010
or someone who would take
away the human rights

02:11:58.010 --> 02:11:58.930
of another person.

02:11:58.930 --> 02:12:02.900
You need to ask what kinds of actions

02:12:02.900 --> 02:12:05.230
are sanctioned by a world view?

02:12:05.230 --> 02:12:07.710
And on atheism, as Dostoyevsky said,

02:12:07.710 --> 02:12:09.570
it seems everything is permitted.

02:12:09.570 --> 02:12:13.090
Humanism, without God
as a basis for humanism,

02:12:13.090 --> 02:12:15.950
is just a form of speciesism,

02:12:15.950 --> 02:12:18.370
a bias in favor of your own species.

02:12:18.370 --> 02:12:23.370
I think Christianity affirms
the real basis for humanism.

02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:27.160
&gt;&gt; Auschwitz is the outcome of centuries

02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:31.470
in which the Christian
Church announced, believed,

02:12:31.470 --> 02:12:33.220
that the Jewish people
had called for the blood

02:12:33.220 --> 02:12:35.810
of Jesus of Nazareth to be on their head

02:12:35.810 --> 02:12:38.020
for every generation.

02:12:38.020 --> 02:12:39.380
It's only in one verse in the Bible,

02:12:39.380 --> 02:12:40.540
I know, but it happens to be the verse

02:12:40.540 --> 02:12:42.240
the Church picked up on.

02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:43.980
I don't say Jesus would
have been a guard there,

02:12:43.980 --> 02:12:45.730
that's not the point,
the point is that this

02:12:45.730 --> 02:12:47.950
is not an aberration of religion,

02:12:47.950 --> 02:12:50.210
it is a scriptural injunction

02:12:50.210 --> 02:12:52.130
as is the one to kill the Amalekites--

02:12:52.130 --> 02:12:53.410
&gt;&gt; No, there's no scriptural--

02:12:53.410 --> 02:12:54.450
&gt;&gt; Christopher: As is the one to mutilate

02:12:54.450 --> 02:12:56.630
the genitals of children.

02:12:56.630 --> 02:12:57.463
&gt;&gt; It is.

02:12:57.463 --> 02:12:59.050
The issue is would Jesus have been

02:12:59.050 --> 02:13:01.860
a guard at Auschwitz
because insofar as people

02:13:01.860 --> 02:13:05.960
who claim to be his followers
were guards at Auschwitz,

02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:07.900
they were acting inconsistently

02:13:07.900 --> 02:13:10.717
and in defiance of the
ethic of Jesus of Nazareth.

02:13:10.717 --> 02:13:11.920
&gt;&gt; Well you should tell
that to the Vatican.

02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:14.160
I mean we know, Paul Johnson and his

02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:19.160
very friendly history of
Christianity says that,

02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:24.240
up to 50 to 60% of the
Waffen-SS were practicing,

02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:27.260
confessing Catholics in good standing.

02:13:27.260 --> 02:13:29.490
No one was ever threatened with discipline

02:13:29.490 --> 02:13:31.670
by the church with
excommunication, for example,

02:13:31.670 --> 02:13:33.710
for taking part in the Final Solution.

02:13:33.710 --> 02:13:36.290
The only Nazi ever
excommunicated by the church

02:13:36.290 --> 02:13:39.090
was Joseph Goebbels and, if
you like, I'll tell you why.

02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:41.073
&gt;&gt; Hugh: To the student.

02:13:41.073 --> 02:13:43.523
&gt;&gt; His wife was a divorced Protestant.

02:13:45.230 --> 02:13:46.063
&gt;&gt; Hugh: He was going to tell us anyway.

02:13:46.063 --> 02:13:49.090
&gt;&gt; Excuse, excuse me, Christianity
does have some standards.

02:13:49.090 --> 02:13:49.923
&gt;&gt; Next student.

02:13:52.638 --> 02:13:53.640
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'd just like
to thank both you guys

02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:55.320
for being here and in
the interest of fairness,

02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:56.600
I know I'm playing devil's advocate here,

02:13:56.600 --> 02:14:00.040
pun intended, but I think
since almost all of the

02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:04.030
questions are going to be
directed towards Mr. Hitchens

02:14:04.030 --> 02:14:05.790
I think we should have on for Dr. Craig.

02:14:05.790 --> 02:14:08.000
&gt;&gt; Christopher: They're
all for both of us.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:09.960
&gt;&gt; For Dr. Craig, what do you think about

02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:12.630
Epicurus' argument that
if God is omnibenevolent,

02:14:12.630 --> 02:14:15.380
omniscient, and omnipotent,
if He knows about kids

02:14:15.380 --> 02:14:18.790
in Africa that are born with AIDS,

02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:20.270
what do you think about Him suggesting,

02:14:20.270 --> 02:14:23.230
like Him not intervening and
Him not changing that fact?

02:14:23.230 --> 02:14:25.560
That's a question that
I've always struggled with

02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:26.660
so I'm just wondering,

02:14:27.570 --> 02:14:29.070
could you expand on that and
I'd also like your input on it.

02:14:29.070 --> 02:14:29.903
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

02:14:29.903 --> 02:14:31.760
The Problem of Evil and Suffering

02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:34.900
has been greatly discussed by philosophers

02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:36.860
and I think there's been genuine progress

02:14:36.860 --> 02:14:40.810
made in this century on this problem.

02:14:40.810 --> 02:14:42.880
I think it's important to
distinguish between the

02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:45.760
intellectual problem of suffering

02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:48.087
and the emotional problem of suffering

02:14:48.087 --> 02:14:51.160
because these are quite
different from each other.

02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:53.500
In terms of the intellectual
problem of suffering,

02:14:53.500 --> 02:14:57.030
I think that there you
need to ask yourself

02:14:57.030 --> 02:15:01.230
is the atheist claiming, as Epicurus did,

02:15:01.230 --> 02:15:05.790
that the existence of God
is logically incompatible

02:15:05.790 --> 02:15:08.080
with the evil and suffering in the world?

02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:09.970
If that's what the
atheist is claiming then

02:15:09.970 --> 02:15:12.100
he's got to be presupposing some kind

02:15:12.100 --> 02:15:14.530
of hidden assumptions that would bring out

02:15:14.530 --> 02:15:16.660
that contradiction and make it explicit

02:15:16.660 --> 02:15:20.690
because these statements are
not explicitly contradictory.

02:15:20.690 --> 02:15:22.950
The problem is no
philosopher in the history

02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:24.760
of the world has ever
been able to identify

02:15:24.760 --> 02:15:27.130
what those hidden
assumptions would be that

02:15:27.130 --> 02:15:29.650
would bring out the contradiction
and make it explicit.

02:15:29.650 --> 02:15:32.350
On the contrary, you can actually prove

02:15:32.350 --> 02:15:35.230
that these are logically
compatible with each other

02:15:35.230 --> 02:15:37.790
by adding a third proposition, namely,

02:15:37.790 --> 02:15:40.320
that God has morally sufficient reasons

02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:43.010
for permitting the evil in the world.

02:15:43.010 --> 02:15:46.700
As long as that statement
is even possibly true,

02:15:46.700 --> 02:15:49.540
it proves that there's no
logical incompatibility

02:15:49.540 --> 02:15:51.790
between God and the
suffering in the world.

02:15:51.790 --> 02:15:54.340
So the atheist would have to show that

02:15:54.340 --> 02:15:57.840
it is logically impossible
for God to have morally

02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:00.380
sufficient reasons for
permitting the evil and suffering

02:16:00.380 --> 02:16:03.360
in the world and no atheist
has ever been able to do that.

02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:06.270
So, that the logical
version of this problem,

02:16:06.270 --> 02:16:09.190
I think, is widely
recognized to have failed.

02:16:09.190 --> 02:16:11.230
Those atheists who still press the problem

02:16:11.230 --> 02:16:13.780
therefore press it as a
probabilistic argument.

02:16:13.780 --> 02:16:17.130
They try to say that, given
the evil in the world,

02:16:17.130 --> 02:16:19.250
it's improbable that God exists,

02:16:19.250 --> 02:16:21.860
not impossible but improbable.

02:16:21.860 --> 02:16:25.320
Well, again, the difficulty
there is that the atheist

02:16:25.320 --> 02:16:29.460
has to claim that if
God did exist then it is

02:16:29.460 --> 02:16:32.500
improbable that he would permit the evil

02:16:32.500 --> 02:16:34.270
and suffering in the world.

02:16:34.270 --> 02:16:37.140
And how could the atheist
possibly know that?

02:16:37.140 --> 02:16:41.510
How could the atheist
know that God would not,

02:16:41.510 --> 02:16:43.960
if He existed, permit the evil
and suffering in the world.

02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:46.440
Maybe He's got good reasons for it.

02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:49.070
Maybe, like in Christian theism,

02:16:49.070 --> 02:16:51.414
God's purpose for human
history is to bring

02:16:51.414 --> 02:16:54.550
the maximum number of people freely

02:16:54.550 --> 02:16:58.440
into his kingdom to find
salvation and eternal life

02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:00.770
and how do we know that
that wouldn't require

02:17:00.770 --> 02:17:04.350
a world that is simply
suffused with natural

02:17:04.350 --> 02:17:06.150
and moral suffering.

02:17:06.150 --> 02:17:08.270
It might be that only in a world like that

02:17:08.270 --> 02:17:10.510
the maximum number of
people would freely come

02:17:10.510 --> 02:17:12.900
to know God and find salvation.

02:17:12.900 --> 02:17:16.070
So the atheist would
have to show that there

02:17:16.070 --> 02:17:19.350
is a possible world
that's feasible for God

02:17:19.350 --> 02:17:21.330
which God could've created that would have

02:17:21.330 --> 02:17:24.450
just as much salvation and eternal life

02:17:24.450 --> 02:17:26.760
and knowledge of God as the actual world

02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:28.580
but with less suffering.

02:17:28.580 --> 02:17:30.430
And how could the atheist
prove such a thing?

02:17:30.430 --> 02:17:32.700
It's sheer speculation.

02:17:32.700 --> 02:17:36.170
So the problem is that, as an argument,

02:17:36.170 --> 02:17:41.170
the Problem of Evil makes
probability judgements

02:17:42.430 --> 02:17:45.810
which are very, very
ambitious and which we

02:17:45.810 --> 02:17:47.780
are simply not in a position to make

02:17:47.780 --> 02:17:49.620
with any kind of confidence.

02:17:49.620 --> 02:17:54.620
Now, I recognize that that
philosophical response

02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:57.470
to the question doesn't deal
with the emotional problem

02:17:57.470 --> 02:17:59.660
of evil and I think that for most people,

02:17:59.660 --> 02:18:01.610
this isn't really a philosophical problem,

02:18:01.610 --> 02:18:03.560
it's an emotional problem.

02:18:03.560 --> 02:18:06.665
They just don't like a god
who would permit suffering

02:18:06.665 --> 02:18:11.254
and pain in the world so
they turn their backs on him.

02:18:11.254 --> 02:18:13.950
What does Christianity have
to say to this problem?

02:18:13.950 --> 02:18:15.990
Well, I think it has a lot to say.

02:18:15.990 --> 02:18:17.980
It tells us that God is not some sort

02:18:17.980 --> 02:18:21.270
of an impersonal ground
of being or an indifferent

02:18:21.270 --> 02:18:25.058
tyrant who folds his arms
and watches the world suffer.

02:18:25.058 --> 02:18:28.720
Rather, He is a god who
enters into human history

02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:32.030
in the person of Jesus
Christ and what does He do?

02:18:32.030 --> 02:18:33.720
He suffers.

02:18:33.720 --> 02:18:37.490
On the cross, Christ
bore a suffering of which

02:18:37.490 --> 02:18:39.540
we can form no conception.

02:18:39.540 --> 02:18:42.880
Even though He was innocent,
He bore the penalty

02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:44.210
of the sins of the whole world.

02:18:44.210 --> 02:18:47.430
None of us can comprehend
what He suffered.

02:18:47.430 --> 02:18:51.630
And I think when we
contemplate the cross of Christ

02:18:51.630 --> 02:18:53.850
and His love for us
and what He was willing

02:18:53.850 --> 02:18:56.060
to undergo for us, it puts the problem

02:18:56.060 --> 02:18:58.940
of suffering in an entirely
different perspective.

02:18:58.940 --> 02:19:02.980
It means, I think, that
we can bear the suffering

02:19:02.980 --> 02:19:05.940
that God calls upon us
to endure in this life

02:19:05.940 --> 02:19:10.370
with courage and with
optimism for an eternal life

02:19:10.370 --> 02:19:13.900
of unending joy beyond the grave because

02:19:13.900 --> 02:19:16.450
of what Christ has done
for us and He will give us,

02:19:16.450 --> 02:19:19.660
I think, the courage and
the strength to get through

02:19:19.660 --> 02:19:22.700
the suffering that God calls
upon us to bear in this life.

02:19:22.700 --> 02:19:25.288
So, whether it's an emotional issue

02:19:25.288 --> 02:19:29.250
or intellectual issue I think ultimately

02:19:29.250 --> 02:19:31.120
Christian theism can make sense out of

02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:33.070
the suffering and evil in the world.

02:19:33.070 --> 02:19:34.880
&gt;&gt; As the clock winds down I reserve the

02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:36.970
last question for myself, Mr. Hitchens.

02:19:36.970 --> 02:19:38.240
&gt;&gt; Just on the devil's advocate point,

02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:41.470
when the Vatican asked me to
testify against Mother Teresa,

02:19:41.470 --> 02:19:43.210
I discovered, which I
did, I discovered that

02:19:43.210 --> 02:19:45.910
the office of devil's advocate
has been abolished now.

02:19:47.080 --> 02:19:48.970
So, I come before you as the only person

02:19:48.970 --> 02:19:51.170
ever to have represented
the devil pro bono.

02:19:52.607 --> 02:19:53.710
[audience laughing]

02:19:53.710 --> 02:19:54.620
&gt;&gt; Hugh: Last question.

02:19:54.620 --> 02:19:58.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah, now, I'm not one
of, I was very intrigued

02:19:58.020 --> 02:20:00.960
by that reply and largely agree with it.

02:20:00.960 --> 02:20:03.430
If I was a believer, I would not feel God

02:20:03.430 --> 02:20:04.780
owed me an explanation.

02:20:04.780 --> 02:20:06.340
I'm not one of those atheists who thinks

02:20:06.340 --> 02:20:08.660
you can go around saying, complaining,

02:20:08.660 --> 02:20:10.690
if you make the assumption
that there is a deity

02:20:10.690 --> 02:20:13.540
then all things are possible.

02:20:13.540 --> 02:20:16.008
You just have to be able
to make that assumption.

02:20:16.008 --> 02:20:17.770
At our debate in Dallas the other day

02:20:17.770 --> 02:20:21.030
I mentioned the case of Fräulein Fritzl,

02:20:21.030 --> 02:20:23.180
the Austrian woman who was imprisoned

02:20:23.180 --> 02:20:24.830
in a dungeon by her father for quarter

02:20:24.830 --> 02:20:28.600
of a century and incestuously
raped and tortured

02:20:28.600 --> 02:20:31.437
and kept in the dark with
her children for 25 years

02:20:31.437 --> 02:20:33.670
and I thought, I asked
people to imagine how

02:20:33.670 --> 02:20:35.370
she must have beseeched him,

02:20:35.370 --> 02:20:36.840
how she must have begged him,

02:20:36.840 --> 02:20:38.350
and how the children must have,

02:20:38.350 --> 02:20:39.750
and how they must have prayed,

02:20:39.750 --> 02:20:42.030
and how those prayers went unanswered,

02:20:42.030 --> 02:20:44.007
and those beggings and
beseechments went unanswered

02:20:44.007 --> 02:20:46.993
for 25 years and, um,

02:20:48.220 --> 02:20:49.967
Douglas Wilson's reply to me was,

02:20:49.967 --> 02:20:51.420
"God will cancel all that

02:20:52.467 --> 02:20:53.920
"and all those tears will be dried,"

02:20:53.920 --> 02:20:56.290
and I said well if you're
capable of believing that

02:20:56.290 --> 02:20:59.240
then obviously what
that woman went through

02:20:59.240 --> 02:21:02.900
and what her children went
through was perfectly worth while

02:21:02.900 --> 02:21:05.930
and her father was all that
time, without knowing it,

02:21:05.930 --> 02:21:08.890
and apparently not
particularly wishing it,

02:21:08.890 --> 02:21:10.400
an instrument of the divine will

02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:12.780
and as I have said to
you before this evening,

02:21:12.780 --> 02:21:15.060
had occasion to say, you're perfectly free

02:21:15.060 --> 02:21:16.860
to believe that if you wish.

02:21:16.860 --> 02:21:18.000
&gt;&gt; Hugh: To conclude--

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:18.833
&gt;&gt; I do.

02:21:18.833 --> 02:21:21.352
&gt;&gt; You could, Mr. Hitchens,

02:21:21.352 --> 02:21:22.740
you've got 4,000 people here,

02:21:22.740 --> 02:21:24.160
tens of thousands more watching.

02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:27.640
You could do the same exchange at Wheaton,

02:21:27.640 --> 02:21:31.220
at Westmont, at Azusa
Pacific, at Point Loma,

02:21:31.220 --> 02:21:33.230
at Notre Dame, at every
great Christian university

02:21:33.230 --> 02:21:34.760
in the United States, why do you think

02:21:34.760 --> 02:21:38.060
so many people come out to see debates

02:21:38.060 --> 02:21:40.663
with accomplished people
like Dr. Craig and you?

02:21:43.930 --> 02:21:48.430
&gt;&gt; It's a time for this great
question to come up again.

02:21:48.430 --> 02:21:50.343
I think there are two reasons for it.

02:21:51.300 --> 02:21:56.300
One is the emergence of a very aggressive

02:21:56.530 --> 02:21:59.983
theocratic challenge in
various parts of the world.

02:22:01.050 --> 02:22:05.730
We are about to see a
long-feared nightmare come true.

02:22:05.730 --> 02:22:08.900
The acquisition of apocalyptic weaponry

02:22:08.900 --> 02:22:12.720
by a Messianic regime in Tehran which

02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:14.880
is already enslaving and ruining

02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:16.763
a formerly great civilization.

02:22:17.880 --> 02:22:22.880
We see the forces of Al
Qaeda and related jihadists

02:22:23.180 --> 02:22:28.180
ruining the societies of Iraq,
of Afghanistan, Pakistan.

02:22:29.970 --> 02:22:34.090
We see Jewish settlers
stealing other people's land

02:22:34.090 --> 02:22:35.320
in the name of God in the hope that

02:22:35.320 --> 02:22:38.120
this will bring on a Messianic combat

02:22:38.120 --> 02:22:40.350
and of the return of the Messiah.

02:22:40.350 --> 02:22:42.490
And even in our own country we're not free

02:22:42.490 --> 02:22:45.170
from people who want to have stultifying

02:22:45.170 --> 02:22:47.180
nonsense taught to our children in school

02:22:47.180 --> 02:22:49.030
and in science class.

02:22:49.030 --> 02:22:52.210
So, there's that, it's
in the news all the time.

02:22:52.210 --> 02:22:54.120
And then there's the existence
of a very small group,

02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:56.050
of which I'm very proud to be a part,

02:22:56.050 --> 02:22:57.940
that says it's time to
take a stand against

02:22:57.940 --> 02:23:01.520
theocratic bullying and
is willing to go anywhere

02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:05.150
to debate these matters and
put these great questions

02:23:05.150 --> 02:23:06.990
to the proof, so.

02:23:06.990 --> 02:23:08.940
And thank you for giving me the chance.

02:23:10.716 --> 02:23:13.716
[audience applause]

02:23:18.980 --> 02:23:21.400
&gt;&gt; I would answer the
question somewhat differently.

02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:25.783
I think that what we're seeing
is the fruit of modernity.

02:23:26.810 --> 02:23:29.930
In the Enlightenment, the
Church and the Monarchy

02:23:29.930 --> 02:23:32.690
were thrown off in the
name of free thought

02:23:32.690 --> 02:23:35.470
and unshackled human inquiry.

02:23:35.470 --> 02:23:37.840
And the thought was that once mankind

02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:40.600
was freed from the shackles and bondage

02:23:40.600 --> 02:23:43.510
of religion that this would produce

02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:46.961
a sort of humanistic utopia.

02:23:46.961 --> 02:23:49.640
And instead I think what we've come to see

02:23:49.640 --> 02:23:53.330
is the fruit of the
naturalistic world view

02:23:53.330 --> 02:23:58.190
is that mankind is reduced
to meaninglessness,

02:23:58.190 --> 02:24:01.500
valuelessness, and
purposelessness and that

02:24:01.500 --> 02:24:03.670
therefore the question of God's existence

02:24:03.670 --> 02:24:06.660
has become all the more
poignant in our age

02:24:06.660 --> 02:24:09.250
because we're beginning
to question, I think,

02:24:09.250 --> 02:24:11.570
the fruit of modernity

02:24:11.570 --> 02:24:14.310
and questioning scientific naturalism.

02:24:14.310 --> 02:24:18.120
I'm privileged to be part of a revolution

02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:20.570
in Christian philosophy
that has been going on

02:24:20.570 --> 02:24:23.280
over the last half
century that has literally

02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:26.790
transformed the face of
Anglo-American philosophy.

02:24:26.790 --> 02:24:30.460
As the scientific, naturalistic,
atheistic world view

02:24:30.460 --> 02:24:34.750
has been challenged, in the
name of reason and philosophy,

02:24:34.750 --> 02:24:39.550
and the theistic world view reasserted,

02:24:39.550 --> 02:24:43.290
and I believe that we're
seeing a tremendous groundswell

02:24:43.290 --> 02:24:46.430
of interest among laypeople
as this revolution

02:24:46.430 --> 02:24:49.870
is beginning to filter down
to the man in the street.

02:24:49.870 --> 02:24:51.020
So I would see us

02:24:51.020 --> 02:24:56.020
as beginning to question the assumptions

02:24:57.230 --> 02:25:00.660
of modernity and the
bitter fruits of modernity

02:25:00.660 --> 02:25:04.260
that have been so evident
in the 20th century

02:25:04.260 --> 02:25:07.190
and I'm hoping that this will lead to

02:25:07.190 --> 02:25:09.990
a tremendous renaissance
in Christian thinking

02:25:09.990 --> 02:25:11.750
and Christian faith.

02:25:11.750 --> 02:25:15.427
&gt;&gt; To wrap up then--
[audience applause]

02:25:22.420 --> 02:25:25.120
Five quick observations
and some instructions.

02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:27.610
Number one, no good society prohibits

02:25:27.610 --> 02:25:29.660
debates such as this one.

02:25:29.660 --> 02:25:32.453
Number two, only confident
faith welcomes them.

02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:36.583
Only extraordinary
universities stage them,

02:25:38.450 --> 02:25:41.640
and only--
[audience applause]

02:25:41.640 --> 02:25:45.010
Only very accomplished
scholars and intellectuals

02:25:45.010 --> 02:25:46.790
can make them interesting
and entertaining.

02:25:46.790 --> 02:25:49.803
Please join me in welcoming
and thanking our panelists.

02:25:51.782 --> 02:25:54.782
[audience applause]

02:26:04.150 --> 02:26:08.338
Both men,
[audience applause]

02:26:08.338 --> 02:26:12.190
both men,
[audience applause]

02:26:12.190 --> 02:26:14.110
they did agree on one thing,

02:26:14.110 --> 02:26:18.350
which is that N.T. Wright
is a very impressive man,

02:26:18.350 --> 02:26:20.160
I think Christopher Hitchens said,

02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:21.610
and therefore to the viewing audience

02:26:21.610 --> 02:26:23.000
who might not know who N.T. Wright is,

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:26.290
I would recommend, on Mr.
Hitchens' strong recommendation,

02:26:26.290 --> 02:26:27.890
that you get and read his books.

02:26:27.890 --> 02:26:32.130
I also want to tell you that
I'm going to ask you to stay

02:26:32.130 --> 02:26:34.800
in your seats as our
panelists exit stage right.

02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:36.270
There's a book signing

02:26:36.270 --> 02:26:38.750
and I want to ask you if you
have book to stand in line.

02:26:38.750 --> 02:26:40.640
If you don't, please
don't, and to recognize,

02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:43.410
Mr. Hitchens has a five
o'clock flight in the morning.

02:26:43.410 --> 02:26:46.500
So, get your book signed,
he loves to do that,

02:26:46.500 --> 02:26:49.210
but please don't ask him
about his third cousin

02:26:49.210 --> 02:26:50.660
that you once met in Melbourne.

02:26:50.660 --> 02:26:52.330
Just let them get to
talking about the book,

02:26:52.330 --> 02:26:54.830
so gentlemen I'm going to
let you enter stage left here

02:26:54.830 --> 02:26:55.840
and I'll hold them for a second.

02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:56.750
Thank you very much.

02:26:56.750 --> 02:26:58.700
Stay there so they can get around back.

02:27:00.937 --> 02:27:03.937
[audience applause]

02:27:08.405 --> 02:27:09.322
Finally, I,

02:27:13.160 --> 02:27:16.220
I want to thank Dr. Craig Hazen,

02:27:16.220 --> 02:27:18.380
Torrey Honors Institute,
and everyone at Biola

02:27:18.380 --> 02:27:19.213
for coming out this evening.

02:27:19.213 --> 02:27:22.100
Have a safe, productive trip home.

02:27:22.100 --> 02:27:26.163
Good night.
