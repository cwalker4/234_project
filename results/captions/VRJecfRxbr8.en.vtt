MOVING TESTIMONY FROM DR. FORD.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:51.084
I LISTENED TO HER AND I KEPT A

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:55.021
ALREADY VOTED YES FOR KAVANAUGH
BEFORE SHE EVEN SAID A WORD.

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:58.358

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:50.143
TO START AT AN 11, I'M GOING TO
TAKE IT TO A 15 REAL QUICK.

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:52.178
FIRST OF ALL I SHOWED THIS
SPEECH TO ALMOST NO ONE.

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:58.485
NOT MY FAMILY, NOT MY FRIENDS,
NOT EVEN P.J. OR TOBIN OR SQUEE.

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:02.655
THIS IS MY SPEECH.
THERE ARE OTHERS LIKE IT BUT IT

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.991 align:start size:94% position:6%
IS MINE.
I WROTE IT MYSELF LAST NIGHT

00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:13.700 align:start size:94% position:6%
WHILE SCREAMING INTO AN EMPTY
BAG OF DORITOS.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:22.242 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'M HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE OF A
SHAM.

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:28.581
POLITICAL CON JOB ORCHESTRATED
BY THE CLINTONS, GEORGE SOROS,

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:29.816
CATHY GRIFFON, THE GAY MAFIA AND
MR. RONAN SINATRA.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:39.192
NOW I'M USUALLY AN OPTIMIST, I'M
A KEG IS HALF FULL KIND OF GUY.

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:42.896
BUT WHAT I'VE SEEN FROM THE
MONSTERS ON THIS COMMITTEE MAKES

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:47.167 align:start size:94% position:6%
ME WANT TO PUKE AND NOT FROM
BEER.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:55.775
DR. FORD HAS NO EVIDENCE, NONE.
MEANWHILE, I'VE GOT THESE.

00:02:55.775 --> 00:03:02.415
I'VE GOT THESE CALENDARS.
THESE BEAUTIFUL, CREEPY

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:07.854
CALENDARS.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:13.193 align:start size:94% position:6%
AND SQUEE AND DONKEY DONALD
DOUG.

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:16.095 align:start size:94% position:6%
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT SQUEE OR
DONKEY DONG DOUG, DO YOU?

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:18.731
YOU JUST WANT TO HUMILIATE ME IN
FRONT OF MY WIFE.

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:24.971
MY PARENTS, AND ALYSSA FREAKING
MILANO.

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:30.043
WELL GUESS WHAT?
I'M NOT BACKING DOWN YOU SONS OF

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:33.413
BITCHES.
I DON'T KNOW THE MEANING OF THE

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:41.554 align:start size:94% position:6%
WORD STOP.
TO QUOTE MY HERO,

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:45.925
CLINT EASTWOODS CHARACTER IN
"GRAND TORINO," GET THE HELL OFF

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:51.030 align:start size:94% position:6%

&gt;&gt; OKAY.
WELL, I'M HARD AS HELL.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.240 align:start size:94% position:6%
SENATOR FEINSTEIN, YOU WANT TO
FIGHT THIS MONKEY FIRST.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:09.983
&gt;&gt; JUDGE KAVANAUGH, ARE SAYING
THAT ALL THE CLAIMS OF DR. FORD,

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:17.290 align:start size:94% position:6%

ARE FALSE?

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.425 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; DOY.
&gt;&gt; THEN IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:21.294
HIDE, WOULD YOU AGREE TO AN
INDEPENDENT FBI INVESTIGATION

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:22.895 size:81% position:41%
INTO THE ALLEGATION?
&gt;&gt; ASKED AND ANSWERED.

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:25.832
I WANTED A HEARING THE NEXT DAY.
THE NEXT DAY.

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:28.001
&gt;&gt; OKAY, THAT IN NO WAY ANSWERS
MY QUESTION.

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:31.037 align:start size:94% position:6%
WOULD YOU AGREE TO AN FBI
INVESTIGATION?

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:33.806
&gt;&gt; YOU WANT A REAL
INVESTIGATION, THEN JUST LOOK AT

00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:38.144 align:start size:94% position:6%

LOOK AT MY CALENDARS.

00:04:38.144 --> 00:04:44.083 align:start size:94% position:6%

EVERY NIGHT I WAS LIFTING

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:51.791
WEIGHTS WITH PJ AND SQUEE AND
HANDSY HANK AND GANG BANG GREG.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.760
BUT YOU KNOW THE LIBERAL MEDIA
IS GOING TO FIND SOME WAY TO

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.796 align:start size:94% position:6%
SPIN.
&gt;&gt; OKAY, CAN WE VOTE NOW?

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:57.497 align:start size:94% position:6%

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:12.338
SAY THAT IN HIGH SCHOOL YOU WERE
A FREQUENT DRINKER?

00:06:12.338 --> 00:06:18.611 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; LOOK, I LIKE BEER.
OKAY.

00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:25.351

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:41.547
JUST GOOGLED ALL THESE TERMS AND
THEY CLEARLY REFER TO SEX.

00:09:41.547 --> 00:09:44.884 align:start size:94% position:6%
&gt;&gt; WELL THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE
BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE SEX FOR

00:09:44.884 --> 00:09:51.057 align:start size:94% position:6%
MANY, MANY, MANY YEARS.
ALL I DID WAS DRINK A LOT AND

NOT THINK ABOUT HAVING SEX AT
ALL.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:10:03.636 align:start size:94% position:6%
I WAS THE PROUDEST, DRUNKEST
