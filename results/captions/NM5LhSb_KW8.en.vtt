18 Secrets That Casinos Don’t Want You To
Know

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:28.359
When used recreationally, casinos can be a
lot of fun for adults everywhere.

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.970
Many people who choose to gamble, often wonder
what kind of casino secrets the owners might

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.760
be keeping from their patrons.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.570
So, what kind of secrets are casinos hiding
and more importantly, which ones can you learn

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.570
in order to stop losing so much money?

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.670

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.530
Alright so, what about casinos is so secretive
and sinister?

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.700
Well, when you stop and think about it, what
actually makes going to the casino so exciting?

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.009
It isn’t just the allure of a potential
big win that brings us inside, there are a

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.229
few different factors that casino owners don’t
necessarily want to advertise to you.

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.049
The following 18 casino secrets will help
you understand a little more about our favorite

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.490
places to gamble, and hopefully give us a
different perspective on the high roller life.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.909
1) Ambiance Is Down To A Science.

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.950
Blinking lights, fast music, flashy interiors,
these are all factors that influence the speed

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.829
in which you gamble.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.720
Faster gambling will usually mean that you
spend more money.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.729
The music of every slot machine is also tuned
to the exact same key, to avoid obnoxious

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.009
noise and create a more harmonious experience.

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.829
And who wouldn't want to stay in a harmonious
casino in order to win that big jackpot?

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.579
2) No Clocks.

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.329
Most casinos in the world do not contain clocks.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.670
They want you to quickly lose track of time
while entering their building so that you

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.970
can enjoy the atmosphere without worrying
about time, therefore you spend more money.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.620
The only thing casinos want you to think about
is that huge win.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.140
3) Busier Poker Tables = Slower Game.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.010
The more people who are seated at a poker
table, the slower a game goes, and more thinking

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.750
goes into each decision.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.950
You might see some casinos with tables aplenty
to speed up the games, hoping that you might

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.220
spend more money.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.780
Try to find tables that are busier.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.900
4) No windows.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.940
Very similar to not having any clocks located
in your casino, many casinos also do not contain

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.340
any windows.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.630
This is to help you not remember what time
of day it is, hoping that you stay at the

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.500
casino for longer.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.251
It may also be a safety measure in terms of
break-ins, but for the most part, it’s to

00:02:56.251 --> 00:02:58.810
make the casino a self-contained experience.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.850
Again, they just want you to look for that
big casino jackpot.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.730
5) Interiors Designed To Make You Lose Money.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.270
Have you ever noticed that it’s difficult
to locate the cashiers, bathrooms, or exits

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.020
at Casinos, but never the bar or slot machines?

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.120
That’s because many casinos are designed
to make you walk through seas of slot machines

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.690
in order to get to your destination.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.280
They don't want you to cash out, they just
want you to look for that next casino jackpot.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.340
Or rather, for you to lose trying to get to
that next casino jackpot.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.380
6) Don’t Play Keno.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.700
The odds of not winning at Keno are so ridiculously
large, you’re better off donating or burning

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.930
your money than you are spending at this game.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.440
Similar to Roulette, the odds are stacked
against you with these kinds of games.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.050
You’re better off trying to place a large
bet at a slot machine.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.400
There isn't really a gambling game where you're
guaranteed to win at a casino, but there are

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.260
a lot of gambling games you're more than likely
to lose.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.240
7) There’s Security Everywhere.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.650
Think you can get away with counting cards
or hacking a slot machine like you see in

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.150
heist movies?

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.180
Think again.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.209
There are security cameras and guards placed
everywhere.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.120
There are even secret and covert security
guards hiding on in the casino while you’re

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.120
gambling.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.600
These are the facts: the people who run these
gambling sites take their money very seriously.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.160
If you want to get a huge win, then you better
do it with luck.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.240
8) The Occasional Win.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.400
The promise of an occasional huge win or casino
jackpot will really keep you coming back again

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.400
and again.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.350
The key, however, is machines that let you
“win” without really winning much money

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.510
at all.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.950
Very rarely, you can make a huge win at one
of these places, and if this happens to you,

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:52.950
bravo!

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.850
However, take this as a reminder to please
gamble responsibly, and if you have an addiction

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.460
to it seek help immediately.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.760
9) More Games You Shouldn't Play.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.400
Turns out, keno isn't the only game you should
avoid if you're looking to win.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.940
The gambling experts at LIST25 tell us that
Three-Card Poker, Caribbean Stud, and Double

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.590
Exposure Blackjack all have big payouts, but
the people who are gambling have much less

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.410
of a chance at winning.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:29.030
Our advice– stick to the games you know
really well and that are mostly up to chance.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.820
10) They're Watching You.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.610
Similar to our point about the immense amounts
of security, it's helpful to know that when

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.780
you're in a casino it isn't just live people
with their eyes on you.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.130
Cameras are also tracking your every move
and are so advanced they can see the hand

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.310
that you're holding.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.730
LIST25 reports that "it's for your safety"
but we're betting it's more for the safety

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.000
of the casino's money.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.940
11) Casinos Will Recognize Tells.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.110
If you think you can get past human security
or the cameras with your cheating ways, think

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.110
again.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.770
There is an ungodly amount of anti-cheating
training for all casino staff, especially

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.169
security and the people manning the cameras.

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:18.130
Apparently, just like regular gambling enthusiasts,
cheaters have tells.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.130
And .

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.910
12) The Process.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:28.630
What is done with cheaters, we hear you ask?

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.100
Are you taken to a back room where you're
beaten up?

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.600
Well, it's not as brutal as the movies might
have you think– one QUORA user tells us

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.330
that they pretty much just kick you from the
premises.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.300
If you return you'll be charged with trespassing,
then the security has to do a lot of paperwork.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.520
You'll even get to keep all your winnings.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.180
Much less cinematic, but a lot less scary
too.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.389
13) The Chips Are Disgusting.

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:57.850
This one may seem obvious, but if you were
a betting person you would win if you bet

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.770
that the chips at casinos are covered in germs.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.550
This is most likely because they're constantly
handled by all sorts of different people.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.310
Different people, different germs, that's
the way it works.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:15.520
Our advice– wash your hands after the casino
and don't eat any finger foods while you're

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.760
there.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.240
14) Baccarat.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.640
We've talked a lot about games you're probably
going to lose, but what about games that you

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.290
might actually win?

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:30.919
One of the best kept casino secrets is that
Baccarat is one of the easiest games to play.

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:37.060
LIST25 tells us that this is because the game
requires zero skill, often has a low buy in

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.220
and for once, the odds are stacked AGAINST
the house!

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:45.850
Apparently, you just place a bet on either
the player or the banker, then the dealer

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:46.850
deals.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.010
The hand with the closest total to 9 wins.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:55.320
There are obviously a couple more rules, but
it really doesn't get much more complicated.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.389
15) Suicide.

00:07:57.389 --> 00:08:03.630
A tragic tale of what happens when betting
and gambling go wrong, but it's a fact that

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.009
some people commit suicide at casinos.

00:08:06.009 --> 00:08:10.889
We're not sure about numbers because owners
tend to keep suicide on the hush hush, but

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:15.610
we can share with you the harrowing tale of
a man who jumped off a casino parking garage.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:22.610
Apparently, THEDAY reports that at the moment
of his death he had a credit balance of $47,000

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:28.550
and had already spent $200,000 of his retirement
money.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:33.900
His final words are all we have left to say
on this horrible incident: "Sorry.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.990
"I couldn't handle everyone seeming to be
unhappy.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.240
I'll let you know if there's anything on the
other side.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.070
Love you all, Pop."

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.460
16) Dealers.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.250
Let's talk about the dealers at gambling establishments.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.510
They have to wear uniforms, but do you know
why?

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.500
Not because everyone has to wear a uniform
at their job smarty pants, but because casino

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.210
uniforms are specifically designed not to
have pockets.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:04.130
LIST25 shares the fact that the uniforms dealers
are ordered to wear have no places to put

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:09.610
stolen goods, including an apron worn above
the waist so nothing can be tucked into the

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:10.610
waistband.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.310
Well, there goes Danny Ocean's next plan.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.310
17) Distractions.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:19.300
What's a better way to make money as a casino
owner than by distracting your patrons?

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:24.110
In Vegas especially, you'll find what some
call "Party Pits", places full of strippers

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:28.730
and booze that attempt to distract you from
all the money you're spending.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:33.680
Remember dear viewers– when spending money
at LEAST pay attention!

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.430
18) Addicts.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:40.260
This is probably the most important point
on the list, especially if you find yourself

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.810
gambling a lot.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:47.300
The average gambling addict won't look for
help until they are about $40,000 in debt.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.660
Remember everyone listening– gambling is
supposed to be for fun, not as a way to make

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.820
a living or to solve your money problems.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.580
If you think you're slipping into gambling
addiction, you can call the National Problem

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:02.779
Gambling Helpline Network or look online for
some free gambling addiction help.

00:10:02.779 --> 00:10:04.190
And that's it!

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.080
Did you enjoy our list of casino secrets?

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.940
Did we miss any?

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.500
Why don't you card sharks let us know in the
comment section below which casino tricks

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:41.100
and tips we may have forgotten?
