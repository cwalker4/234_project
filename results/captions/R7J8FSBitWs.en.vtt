00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.300
SHANE SMITH: We'd finally found
our North Koreans deep

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.810
in the bush and were busy
talking to them when things

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.370
started to get a bit hairy.

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:21.940
Now these guys are
coming back here.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.912
The dude with the crowbar
is coming back.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.474
MALE SPEAKER 1:
[SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:00:28.474 --> 00:00:31.680
KIM YUN ZUN: [SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.190
IGOR "THE FISH" RYBAKOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.220
SHANE SMITH: He says, what
is that, your off switch?

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.470
MALE SPEAKER 1:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.190
SIMON OSTROVSKY: He says I use
it for fixing tractors.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.480
SHANE SMITH: I like the
Fish more and more.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.600
He took the crowbar from him and
said, what is that, your

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.391
off switch?

00:00:47.391 --> 00:00:49.370
And two North Koreans
came back.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.150
Now they're giving
Mr. Kim shit.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.190
And they're quite angry.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.050
So we're probably going to
have to get out of here.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.300
MALE SPEAKER 1:
[SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.030
SHANE SMITH: And so, oh shit,
here comes another truck.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.190
Now we're surrounded.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.260
They're got a truck up there.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.050
They've got a truck
behind here.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.850
What'd he say?

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.505
SIMON OSTROVSKY: He said he
came to tell us that he

00:01:14.505 --> 00:01:17.070
doesn't want us filming anymore,
and he's come to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.550
block the road.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.800
SHANE SMITH: Really?

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.100
All right.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.800
Well, let's go find
another crew.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.290
Let's go.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.675
The Fish is the boss.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.030
As the Fish took us further
into the forest on these

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.570
rutted dirt tracks, the
atmosphere in the truck got a

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.430
little bit goofy because of
the lunacy that was being

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.580
played out in the oddest game
of low-grade cat and mouse

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.490
I've ever seen.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.950
Ask about how we get home.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.400
We're in a high-speed car chase
at five miles an hour

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.566
through the wilds of Siberia.

00:01:57.566 --> 00:01:59.990
They're stopping, we go to
try to pass them, and

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.950
then they speed up.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.320
We sort of go on a side road,
and then they head

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.520
us off at the pass.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.870
It's a game of chicken out
in the middle of nowhere.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.120
IGOR "THE FISH" RYBAKOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:02:15.742 --> 00:02:16.734
SIMON OSTROVSKY: He was
just telling us.

00:02:16.734 --> 00:02:17.726
KIM YUN ZUN: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:02:17.726 --> 00:02:18.718
IGOR "THE FISH" RYBAKOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:02:18.718 --> 00:02:20.450
SIMON OSTROVSKY: He says he's
on their blacklist.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.850
SHANE SMITH: The Fish seemed
tired of this game and

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.760
suggested we pull over for some
lunch, which consisted of

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.240
paprika chips, bread, vodka,
and a shotgun.

00:02:31.915 --> 00:02:32.860
IGOR "THE FISH" RYBAKOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN], cowboy.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.435
SHANE SMITH: Cowboy.

00:02:33.435 --> 00:02:34.685
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Cowboy.

00:02:42.227 --> 00:02:44.470
SHANE SMITH: The North Koreans
are going-- what the fuck kind

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.530
of journalists are these?

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.820
Well, we found our
North Koreans.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.200
Now let's get wasted and shoot
off guns with the mafia.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.860
I hit it, but I didn't
break it.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.710
SHANE SMITH: It turned
out there was method

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.940
in the Fish's madness.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.410
Because our lunchtime shooting
party seemed to have cowed the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.020
North Koreans just enough to get
us out of the wilderness,

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.030
which was very good because
the all-menacing Siberian

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.570
darkness was fast approaching.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.220
When we finally got to town,
they, of course,

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.190
were waiting for us.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.740
And the North Korean security
dude just showed up.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.020
And he won't leave us alone.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.150
And he's just standing
there trying

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.710
to look at our passports.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.250
And trying to see all
of our stuff.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.360
He's trying to be scary.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.704
SIMON OSTROVSKY:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:03:25.704 --> 00:03:28.690
MALE SPEAKER 2:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.050
SHANE SMITH: And when we got
on the train and said our

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.710
teary goodbyes to the Fish, we
realized that half the one-car

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.390
train was our crew, and the
other half were North Koreans.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.540
[SPEAKING KOREAN]

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.120
SIMON OSTROVSKY: That was
the captain of the camp.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.930
SHANE SMITH: Great.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.740
So we locked ourselves into our
compartment and spent the

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.130
night backing up our hard drives
and hiding all of our

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.390
footage, which turned out be
wise because we were met back

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.830
in Tynda by the FSB, the local
militia, the North Koreans,

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.030
and some plainclothes detectives
who promptly

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.980
detained us.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.510
So they asked us a
lot of questions.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.910
And they kept asking us
about the pipeline.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.185
Are you here to shoot
the pipeline?

00:04:00.185 --> 00:04:01.340
Are you here to shoot
the pipeline?

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.500
We were like, we don't know
anything about a pipeline.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.440
We're here to shoot
North Koreans.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.010
They knew about the Russian cop
who had taken us to the

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.700
North Korean camp.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.620
They knew about the chief
of police in the north.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.550
Simon refused to be intimidated,
and he said, if

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.430
you want to ask any questions,
ask me here.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.339
I'm not going with you.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.690
I'm not going away with you.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.850
They finally let us go.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.600
We freaked out a little
bit, grabbed our

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.089
stuff, and took off.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.320
We quickly hired a car
and made a break

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.480
for the Chinese border.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.110
When we finally got to the
border, we realized that part

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.080
of the reason for all this panic
and fear on the North

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.260
Korean and Russian side was that
Kim Jong-Il, who almost

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.910
never leaves North Korea, had
secretly come to the same

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.400
place we were, the Amur region
of Russia, coincidentally at

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.200
the exact same time we were
there to hold talks with

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.210
President Medvedev about more
trade and labor agreements

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.660
between the two countries.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.770
So this means that, while we
were there, the Great Leader

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.780
was selling even more of his
people off, so he could make

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.680
even more money, so you could
make more weapons, so he could

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.110
extort more food and aid and
supplies from America and

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.020
Japan, who he's technically
still at war with.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.130
And this, better than almost
anything I could think of,

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.080
sums up the lunacy of
the modern world.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.520
Thank you and goodnight.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.790
