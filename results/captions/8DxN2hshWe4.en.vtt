00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.650
JUDY WOODRUFF: Democratic presidential hopefuls
fanned out this weekend, courting voters from

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.350
Iowa to Austin.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.740
John Yang has the story.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.830
JOHN YANG: In Keene, New Hampshire, Vermont
Senator Bernie Sanders made the case for his

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:13.929
presidential candidacy.

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:14.929
SEN.

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.420
BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), Presidential Candidate:
I don't have to tell anyone in this room we're

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.840
living in an unprecedented moment in American
history.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.690
And when you live in an unprecedented moment,
you need to have an unprecedented response,

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.200
which is what this campaign is about.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.200
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.659
JOHN YANG: A self-proclaimed Democratic socialist,
Sanders' positions were labeled impractical

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:40.940
in the 2016 campaign.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.819
Now he seems to be setting the standard his
Democratic competitors are measured against.

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:52.100
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a
progressive, on CBS News' "Face the Nation."

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.579
QUESTION: Do we describe you as a capitalist?

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.710
What's the best...

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.710
SEN.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.710
ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), Presidential Candidate:
Yes.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.710
QUESTION: ... way to describe you?

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.710
SEN.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.710
ELIZABETH WARREN: I believe in markets, markets
that work.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.710
QUESTION: So if you get labeled as a socialist?

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.710
SEN.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.710
ELIZABETH WARREN: Well, it's just wrong.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.710
JOHN YANG: And former Colorado Governor John
Hickenlooper, a moderate.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.049
JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D), Presidential Candidate:
I'm happy to say I'm a capitalist, but I think

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.450
at a certain point the labels do nothing but
divide us.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.880
JOHN YANG: A new Des Moines Register/CNN poll
finds 56 percent of likely Iowa Democratic

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.320
caucus-goers say they would be satisfied with
a nominee who wants the country to be more

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:29.230
socialist; 49 percent back Medicare-for-all;
36 percent support tuition-free college.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.320
This weekend, some candidates shed the winter
coats of Iowa and New Hampshire for sunglasses

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.799
to appear at the South by Southwest conference
in Austin, Texas.

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.390
Thirty-seven-year-old South Bend, Indiana,
Mayor Pete Buttigieg took a swipe at Vice

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.329
President Mike Pence for his steadfast support
of President Trump.

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.890
PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), Mayor of South Bend, Indiana:
How would he allow himself to become the cheerleader

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.579
for the porn star presidency?

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.670
Is it that he stopped believing in Scripture
when he started believing in Donald Trump?

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.409
JOHN YANG: A Republican presidential long
shot, former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld,

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.820
also made the rounds in Austin.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.039
He's exploring a primary challenge to the
president.
