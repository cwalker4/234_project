Have you ever worn a
disguise in public?

00:06:47.273 --> 00:06:49.574
Yes I once spent two hours
putting on a wig in New York,

00:06:49.675 --> 00:06:51.844
and I walked outside in
the very first man I saw

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:53.045
said nice wig, Pink.

00:06:53.145 --> 00:06:55.214
And I went back upstairs
and took that [bleep] off.

00:06:55.314 --> 00:06:56.915
I was terribly embarrassed.

00:06:57.015 --> 00:06:59.118
What Olympic sport do you
think you would be best at?

00:06:59.218 --> 00:07:00.552
Hot dog eating.

00:07:00.652 --> 00:07:02.288
As long as they
were veggie dogs.

00:07:02.388 --> 00:07:04.456
If you weren't a performer,
what would you be doing?

00:07:04.556 --> 00:07:06.626
I would either be
living or working

00:07:06.726 --> 00:07:07.759
at a mental institution.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.097
If you had a perfume,
what would it be called.

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:12.531
Musk.

00:07:12.631 --> 00:07:14.867
Or The Everything Bagel.

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:17.003
Your superhero power
of choice would be?

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.238
To read people's minds.

00:07:19.338 --> 00:07:20.772
'Cause they're
wussies and they never

00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:22.140
say what they're
really thinking.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.043
The funniest fail
you've had on stage?

00:07:24.143 --> 00:07:27.212
I once fell off stage into--

00:07:27.312 --> 00:07:29.448
there was a moat
around the stage.

00:07:29.548 --> 00:07:31.417
And a man had lit up nipples.

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:34.520
And I saw it, and I got excited,
and I walked towards him.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.887
I went straight into the water.

00:07:35.987 --> 00:07:38.357
You're guilty binge food?

00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:39.558
Oh god.

00:07:39.658 --> 00:07:40.559
Everything.

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:44.062
Crumb donuts, or
anything with cheese.

00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:47.399
Or carbs.

00:07:47.499 --> 00:07:49.402
Like pasta.

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:50.435
Hungry.

00:07:50.535 --> 00:07:52.438
Now, Ellen, I have
a question for you.

00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:55.607
What's your least favorite
question to be asked?

00:07:55.707 --> 00:07:58.911
And then I'll have a
question for you next time.

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:00.712
Bye, I love you!

00:08:00.812 --> 00:08:02.849
