00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.620
We last see Asajj Ventress in the Season 5
final of The Clone Wars.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.760
So what happened to her afterwards?

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.330
Her story continues in the book ‘Dark Disciple’.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.301
After helping Ahsoka Tano prove her innocence
over the bombing of the Jedi Temple, Ventress

00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:29.880
left Coruscant and went on to live in a modified
gunship and continued her bounty hunting business.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.480
During this time, she grew out her hair and
obtained a yellow lightsaber from the black

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.290
market to replace the two red lightsabers
she lost on Coruscant.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.230
As a Bounty Hunter, she made a name for herself
and became familiar with many of the galaxy’s

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.610
famous underworld figures.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.300
She befriended a pirate named Lassa Rhayme,
after helping her steal precious cargo from

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.620
Hondo’s gang.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.190
Rhyme offered Ventress to be in her pirate
crew, but Ventress refused, saying to her

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.999
that she prefered to live and work alone.

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:08.540
She later took up a bounty that required her
to capture a Volpai by the name of Moregi.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.730
As she was tracking him down, she bumped into
Quinlan Vos who was disguised as a bounty

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.160
hunter.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.110
Unknown to Ventress, Vos was in fact a Jedi
Master who had been assigned by the Jedi Council

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.680
to go undercover as a bounty hunter and gain
Ventress's trust.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.970
His ultimate goal was to assassinate Count
Dooku, and he believed that partnering up

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.670
with Ventress would help him because she was
familiar with Count Dooku due to her previous

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.230
service to him.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.030
She initially disliked him, but let him help
her hunt her bounty.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.880
The two of them eventually captured Moregi
and split the money.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.680
Afterwards, Vos insisted a partnership with
Ventress.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.060
She reluctantly accepted the offer, due to
his impressive skills and also because she

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.360
was attracted to him.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.670
The two of them took on many bounty hunter
jobs, including jobs from Rhyme and the Pyke

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.240
Syndicate.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.200
Overtime they grew feelings for each other,
but kept their affections to themselves.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.650
Vos, overcome with his feelings for ventress,
eventually told Ventress that he was indeed

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.470
a Jedi and that he was on a mission to assassinate
Count Dooku.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.780
To his surprise, Ventress already knew, citing
his unnatural agility and combat abilities.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.890
She agreed to help him by training him in
the darker aspects of the Force so that the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.280
two of them could stand a better chance against
Count Dooku.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.030
She took him to Dathomir, her homeworld and
a planet filled in the energies of the dark

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.459
side.

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.670
Upon arrival, they witnessed the skeletal
remains of the Nightsister massacre carried

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.640
out by General Grievous about a year before.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.230
There, the two of them exchanged their life
stories.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.670
She told him about her enslavement and the
loss of her Jedi Master Ky Narek, and how

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.960
they lead her to the path of the darkside.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.990
He told her how he too lost his Master who
went by the name of Tholme.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.240
Even though Ventress was the one who killed
Tholme, she told him that it was Count Dooku

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.080
who killed him.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.980
During the training, Ventress trained Vos
in the teachings and culture of the Nightsisters

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.620
use of the dark side of the force.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.740
She had him kill innocent animals with the
force, use the dark side to control beasts,

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.459
train in aggressive lightsaber combat, and
to use his hatred when performing the force.

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.160
As the training went on, they revealed their
feelings for one another and fell in love.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.630
Vos declared that after the assassination
was done, he would not return to the Jedi

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.020
and would instead commit himself to Ventress.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.849
Ventress eventually received information on
Dooku’s whereabouts from her contact who

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.819
was still apart of the Confederacy of Independent
Systems.

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.330
She told Ventress that Count Dooku was going
to soon visit the Separatist capital world

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.580
of Raxus to attend a ceremony.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.800
The two of them made their way to Raxus, where
they disguised themselves and were able to

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.080
get close enough to Count Dooku to confront
him.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.640
They confronted him in a 2 to 1 duel.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.300
However, Grievous joined in and tipped the
fight in favor of Dooku.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.519
Ventress and Vos were overwhelmed by both
foes and the incoming droid forces.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.810
Ventress was forced to escape, leaving Vos
to being captured by Count Dooku.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.770
Ventress swore to herself that she would rescue
him.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.840
Meanwhile, Vos embraced the full power of
the dark side, believing Ventress set him

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.380
up to fail the whole time.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.410
Ventress knew that Dooku would take Vos to
his palace on Serenno for imprisonment, and

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.090
that she needed help rescuing him.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:54.600
She got the help of Boba Fett, Bossk, Razzi,
C-21 Highsinger, and Embo, after negotiating

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.100
to pay them 250,000 credits for the rescue
mission.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.020
They arrived to Serenno on Boba Fett’s ship,
Slave 1.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.910
There, the bounty hunters acted as a distraction
for the palace’s droid security forces while

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.310
Ventress snuck inside the palace to find Vos.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.430
She eventually found him broken, from being
tortured by Dooku.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.530
When Vos sensed her, he attacked her, calling
her a liar and manipulator.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.220
He found out that it was her who killed his
Master Thomle, not Dooku.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.401
As they fought each other, they made their
way out of the palace, where they would see

00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:32.680
the bounty hunters fighting Dooku.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.530
Vos attempted to aid Dooku in his fight, and
that was when Ventress knew that Vos not only

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.930
embraced to dark side, but he joined the Sith
Order itself.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.930
Ventress and the bounty hunters barely escaped
the failed rescue mission.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.030
Still wishing to rescue Vos and having no
other options left, Ventress decided to reach

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.560
out to the Jedi.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.270
She contacted Obi Wan and met him in a bar
on Coruscant.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.500
There she told him what happened to Vos.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.150
Afterwards, the two parted ways, and Ventress
went back to work as a bounty hunter.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.900
She returned to live on Coruscant on Level
1313.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:18.229
There she fell into a deep depression worsened
by alcoholism and severe insomnia.

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:23.930
She was haunted by thoughts of Vos, who had
became Count Dooku’s new right hand man

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.540
with the new name "Admiral Enigma".

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:34.669
She later met Akar-Deshu, a Jedi Knight and
a close friend of Vos, who seeked Ventress

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:37.580
in order to have her help get Vos back.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.540
She agreed, and followed the Jedi knight back
to the Jedi Temple.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.570
There she went before the Jedi Council, where
Yoda gave her a mission to help Anakin and

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.009
Obi Wan capture and redeem Vos.

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:55.010
She accepted, wanting to get her lover back
and also because Yoda promised to officially

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.230
pardon her of all her past crimes.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:04.400
Ventress and the 2 Jedi would eventually land
in Dooku’s Providence-class dreadnought,

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.050
where they believed they would find Vos.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.082
There they confronted Dooku and discovered
that Vos was still a prisoner and that he

00:07:11.082 --> 00:07:13.550
never actually joined Dooku.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.080
They rescued Vos and escaped Dooku’s dreadnought.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.289
They made it back to the Jedi Temple where
Ventress was pardoned for her past crimes

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:24.509
and Vos rejoined the Jedi.

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:28.759
Unknown to the Jedi, Vos was still under the
influence of the dark side.

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:34.449
However, Yoda suspected this and decided to
test Vos’ allegiance by sending him once

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:38.669
again on a mission to assassinate Count Dooku.

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:44.410
Vos was able to convince Ventress to join
him on this mission and she accepted.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:49.509
He gave her forgiveness over killing his master
and told her he still loves her.

00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:53.919
During the mission, they tracked Dooku to
Christophsis, where they confronted him once

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:55.669
more.

00:07:55.669 --> 00:08:01.090
They got overwhelmed and Ventress sacrificed
herself to save Vos from a lethal blast of

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.860
force lighting from Dooku.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.360
Seeing his lover being killed, Vos defeated
Dooku.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.199
As he did, he felt a sense of clarity and
spared Dooku’s life.

00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:16.180
Vos then attended to Ventress who died in
his arms.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:21.539
Dooku escaped and Vos was brought back into
the Jedi Order after attending a hearing with

00:08:21.539 --> 00:08:23.520
the Jedi Council.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:28.430
They let him back in after admitting that
sending him on a mission to assassinate Dooku

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:33.260
was not the Jedi way in the first place and
felt some of the blame for Vos turning to

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.010
the dark side was on them.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:42.479
Both Vos and Obi Wan attended Ventress's funeral
on Dathomir, where she was buried in the traditional

00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:52.189
way of her people.
