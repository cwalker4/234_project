00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.670
Whether you're an entrepreneur or just an
independent contractor, guess what we all

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.670
are.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:07.670
We're all sales people.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.550
So when somebody says, "I'm not a salesperson,
I'm an entrepreneur, they don't really understand

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.550
the meaning of an entrepreneur.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.580
Every entrepreneur is a salesperson.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:21.320
So, I want you to today look at this from
the process of asking yourself which part

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.640
of the sales process do I make a mistake in.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.340
Where is your leak in the sales process of
whatever your business may be, where is the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.340
leak that you have?

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.280
Because for me, over the years, every single
time my sales would drop or I would see someone

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.800
outdoing me, I would always ask myself where
in the process do I have a problem with.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.930
Where in the process is a challenge I have
that I have to figure out how to improve.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.679
Because in reality, improving in sales, sales
is really about discipline, and it's about

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:53.679
details.

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:56.829
If you are not disciplined, which means work
ethic, diligence, follow through, all that

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.249
stuff, or you're not paying attention to the
details that we're about to get into right

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:01.601
now, you're simply winging it.

00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:05.320
And you don't want to wing sales.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.810
A lot of people may disagree, sales is guaranteed
to work.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.810
Listen.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.800
When people tell me I didn't make it in sales,
I guarantee you lacked discipline, or you

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.670
didn't pay attention to details and you don't
want to work that hard.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.110
Sales will work for anybody.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.730
I firmly believe that.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.910
Anybody, it will work.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.450
It's just that most people don't want to be
disciplined and most people don't pay attention

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.450
to details.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.350
So let's get right into the sales process.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.630
So in sales, you'll typically hear no matter
what business you're in, you'll go through

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.690
the flow of sales.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.100
Some say there's five steps, some say there's
six steps, seven steps, 10 steps, three steps.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.620
I'm explaining six steps here to you right
now.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.920
Step #1 is prospecting.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.990
#2 is approach and contact, three is presentation,
four is follow up, then it's referral, then

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.260
it's maintaining your customer relationships.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.170
So let's get right through it, and you need
to ask yourself which of these areas you struggle

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.170
with.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.170
So let's start off with the first one.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.170
The first one is what?

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.170
Prospecting.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.170
So what is prospecting?

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.830
So prospecting a lot of times, people will
think prospecting is going out there in the

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.659
cold market and trying to get somebody to
buy a house from you and I'm going to meet

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:13.930
them at a mall.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.629
Or prospecting is me going out there in the
cold market and trying to get somebody to

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.579
buy my technology from me for their company.

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:24.829
That's prospecting.

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:25.829
No.

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.359
Prospecting is multiple different ways of
prospecting.

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:34.180
And I'm going to explain every single one
of these prospecting to you, extremely in

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.329
depth.

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:37.859
So you ask yourself which one you're very
good at.

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:38.859
So think about it.

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:43.159
First of all, there's really three different
types of people in the world of prospecting

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.159
that you know.

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:52.599
One is people you don't know, two is people
you do know, and three is people your people

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:53.599
know.

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:59.700
Again, people you don't know - cold market,
people you know, this is your warm market,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.489
three, people your people know, which for
me it's my favorite market because there's

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:05.989
nothing like getting into this market.

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:12.609
Now from the lowest to the highest, the lowest
percentage of conversion is people you don't

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:18.299
know, then it's people your people know, then
it's people you know.

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.879
Sometimes this is harder than this one by
the way, but stay with me here.

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.760
So Pat, great, now I know what my market is.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.760
Excellent.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.760
So how do I now get a market.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.760
No problem.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.279
You've got to look at prospecting as a multiple
different ways of catching a fish.

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:35.779
So you can't just have one way of doing it.

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:40.159
You need to have multiple different nets out
there and one of them is generally going to

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.209
work with you.

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.209
Pick any product.

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.939
I don't care what product it is.

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.610
Pick any product you're selling.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.180
You can figure out ways to get into other
markets.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.180
How can you do that?

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.040
One is social media, one outlet is social
media, and there's a lot of people doing that,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.260
you can do it on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter,
you can do sponsored posts, boost them, you

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.010
can do Instagram posts and boost it, you can
do YouTube, Google Adwords, there's so many

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.340
things you can do on social media.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.750
The other one on people you don't know is
networking events.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.099
You can go to networking events, especially
the area of networking events that's predicated

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.629
to the market that you're mainly marketing.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.940
So whatever your networking event you want
to go to that people are there, I did a video

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.421
on it last week -- what was the video called
that we did last week?

00:04:20.421 --> 00:04:23.040
It was called how to Charm Like Casanova.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.820
In that video how to charm like Casanova,
I talk about 18 different ways to master the

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.820
art of networking.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.040
If you haven't watched that video, go watch
the video.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.890
It's one of the previous episodes.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.250
So how to become a better networker.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.300
One is networking events.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.720
Another one is going into cold market prospecting.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.250
You just meet people randomly and you approach
them and you have a script.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.250
Prospecting.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.650
Another one may be friendship farming; you're
turning strangers into friends.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.160
So I don't know John, but I keep going to
this restaurant and eventually John and I

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.080
become best friends because we have lunch
at 12:00 and every day we talk sports.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.600
Six weeks from now we had four beers together
and I already know his life's story, his family,

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.640
I just told him hey, what kind of business
are you in.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.890
That relationship went from being a cold relationship
to now warm, to now we went golfing together,

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:10.890
we have a friendship now.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.530
Our wives have met each other, whatever.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.090
I know his kids, I've met his parents, I've
met his girlfriend, I met her boyfriend, we're

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.200
good, we get along.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.380
There's a relationship there.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.620
So strangers into friends.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.850
That's a whole different video by itself.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:30.370
Then there is friendship, where people that
your people know.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:36.400
I love this part with referrals on prospecting
because I'm going to get back to referrals

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.310
but on the prospecting side, on who my people
know, they make for the best prospects, on

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.770
when I ask them specifically what kind of
clients I'm looking at.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.860
So then there's center of influence.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:46.860
What's center of influence?

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.950
Center of influence for me in prospecting
is you taking the top 20 people you respect

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.310
the most in your community.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.310
Make a list of it.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.870
Top 20 people you respect in your community,
make a list of it.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.360
Then you know what I want you to do?

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.790
I want you to contact these 20 people and
ask them to go have a cup of coffee with you.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.030
What's the script sound like?

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:09.280
Like this, hey, I really value the fact that
you're a successful entrepreneur and one day

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.210
I'm planning on being someone like you.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.640
I would love to treat you to coffee one of
these days or lunch, when is a good time for

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.640
us to go out?

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.290
It's on me, I just want 30 minutes of your
time.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.290
No problem.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.990
Then you go, and you're simply building a
relationship.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.220
Eventually, three, six, 12 months later, you
give whatever you can to them, they're going

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.410
to give back to you.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.410
How can I help you?

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.580
They'll give you the contacts or relationship
that they have that could help you, right?

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.720
And so then that needs to be maintained constantly.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.760
So there's many different ways to improve
in the prospecting side.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.330
Now let's continue because I'm going to come
back to prospecting.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.170
Approach and Contact -- what's approach and
contact?

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:48.810
Well, one could be how you send your formal
email to somebody to follow up with them once

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.060
you've got the info.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.851
So I've got the number, I got the phone number,
I got the email address, I got first name,

00:06:54.851 --> 00:06:56.260
last name, then what do I do?

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.410
Step #2, I befriend them on LinkedIn.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.700
Then on LinkedIn I send them a message or
if I already have their email, I send them

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:06.990
an email and I say, "hey, it was a pleasure
meeting you earlier today.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.020
I was impressed with . . . and I'd love for
us to schedule a time to visit and talk about

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.360
. . . I think there's ways we can create a
synergistic relationship."

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.680
Great.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.590
So that's the approach and contact, what is
that script that you have with this.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.620
Then there's a phone call script.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.620
What script do you have.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:30.850
I mean, I can tell you, I sold Bally's memberships
back in 1999, that was what, 17 years ago

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.020
we're talking about.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.470
I know the script till today.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.090
Here's what the script sounded like.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.570
So somebody calls in and we'd call it a telephone
inquiry.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.830
They're put on hold and they would say line
one.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:41.830
You would pick up.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.440
Thank you for holding, how may I help you?

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.070
Yes, I'm calling to get more information about
a gym.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.070
No problem.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.070
You called at a great time.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.670
By coming in today you can get started as
low as $5 down, and a monthly membership would

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.980
only break down to be a six to eight dollars
a week.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.180
By the way, what are some of your fitness
goals?

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.050
Are you trying to lose weight, tone up, or
increase energy?

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.450
I want to increase energy.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:02.670
Are you currently working out at a gym?

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:03.670
I'm not.

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:04.670
What is your current routine?

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:05.670
How far do you live from here?

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:06.670
etc. etc.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.320
Let me give you a virtual tour of what our
gym looks like.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.330
That's exactly the script.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.770
And then we'd go into scheduling a time for
you to come in.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:12.770
It was a script.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:13.770
It worked.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.960
Now obviously most people say, I don't like
scripts.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.960
Look.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.080
My body and your body is made up of skeletons
that's generally the same.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.080
Okay.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.160
.You may have longer legs.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.190
You may have shorter legs.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.760
You may have bigger feet, smaller feet, you
may have bigger hands, smaller hands.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.539
Bigger torso, wider shoulders, smaller head,
bigger head, skinny, it doesn't matter.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:36.039
The skeleton is generally the same.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:40.310
It's the body and the skin outside that may
be a little bit different.

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:44.330
You need a script and then from there you
can add your personality to it.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.390
But there needs to be a script.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:49.810
So do you have a script for your approach
and contact once you get this [the prospect].

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.050
Email, Facebook, LinkedIn, call.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.050
Do you have that?

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.240
If you don't, that is a leak.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.270
You need to have that.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:55.620
#3: Presentation.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.570
So a lot of times believe it or not, out of
all these things, you know what's the one

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.810
thing most people are very, very good at?

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:02.810
Presentation.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:03.810
Why?

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.270
It's the easiest one.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:06.270
Anybody can present.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.650
It's so easy to present.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:11.860
Oh, I know everything about our presentation,
but how come I'm not making a lot of money?

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.560
Because this [presentation] doesn't make you
a lot of money.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.560
This doesn't make you money.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.560
This is very easy to do.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.560
This doesn't mean you don't need to be good
at this.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.710
This is very important, but it's the easiest
one to do.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.870
It ain't that hard to learn how to give the
presentation.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:29.020
So what are some leaks on presentations that
you'll generally see?

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.390
Oh my gosh.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:35.200
If you catch yourself in a presentation, it's
a sit down with a business owner.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.070
It's a sit down with a client at the kitchen
table.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.510
It's a sit down with them coming to your office.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:45.240
It's a sit down with a product you're selling,
it's furniture, and they want to furnish their

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.240
house.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.240
Whatever it is.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.200
If it's a lot of talk talk talk talk talk,
no one cares.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.260
You've lost them.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.260
Okay?

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.930
I would watch people's presentations, carriers
would come and they would say, hey let me

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.330
tell you about the history of our company.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:01.360
And I specifically said, look, I just want
you to know, you've been around since 1886,

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.010
I'm very impressed, what are we going to do
here?

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:05.170
Here's what we're looking for.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:06.170
No problem.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.180
So don't be the person that goes for 17 minutes
- you know, the history of our company..

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.080
. . 30 seconds?

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.080
Maybe.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.080
Seven minutes?

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.080
Too long.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.080
Brief.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.300
It's all about a good presenter is very good
at asking questions so tell me, what's important

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.300
to you?

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.300
What's important to them?

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.300
What do you think about this?

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.300
What do you think about that?

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.300
How about this part?

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.300
What do you think about that?

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.300
What do you think about this?

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.300
Is this important?

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.300
How do you feel about it?

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.300
How do they feel about it?

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.300
How does your wife feel about it?

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.300
How do your customers feel about it?

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.300
Is that something that's important to you?

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.300
Between 0-10, what would you say it is?

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.590
It's questions that you're asking on the presentation.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.690
If it's too many statements without questions,
you're not a good presenter.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.150
A good presenter is somebody that's also asking
questions because you're getting to find out

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.150
about who?

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.150
Them.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.690
Sales is so simple.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.460
Sales is so easy.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.810
If you simply look at the customers as you.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:55.260
This is how I like to sell.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:11:01.340
I look at you as the customer and I ask myself,
if I were you, what would I buy and what would

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.970
serve you if I'm you?

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:07.420
And so I say, look, if I were you, I would
need this, this this based on this this this

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.810
that you told me and I would need a little
bit of this, this this based on that that

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:11.810
you told me.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:14.480
Even though you have this right now, you're
paying this much for it, but I don't think

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.250
you have a need for it because you told me
this, this, this.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:18.440
So here's what I propose with you.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.380
I say we start with this, we start with this,
you can drop this, and that's good for starters

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.800
and then 12 months from now, let's revisit
to see what we can do.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.880
What do you think about that?

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.880
Great.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.880
Any questions?

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.880
No.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.880
Let's get the paperwork started.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.880
Very simple, right?

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.120
Presentation is questions and knowing your
craft, knowing your product and generally

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.860
not BSing people when you don't know what
you're talking about.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.050
Next is follow up.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:39.050
Okay.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:42.100
Remember how I said two things is the reason
why people don't make money in sales?

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.220
What was one of them?

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.220
Discipline.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.930
Guess what this is? 100% discipline.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.250
This is nothing more than discipline.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.339
It's nothing more than discipline.

00:11:51.339 --> 00:11:53.980
I talked to you about the other D which was
what?

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.980
Details.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.610
So why is discipline and details important
here?

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:02.861
Well, details is very important because if
you're following up with me as a customer,

00:12:02.861 --> 00:12:08.110
and you don't remember our conversation's
details that we had the first time, it tells

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.940
me you don't pay attention to things.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.750
You're just trying to get the money.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:12.750
Okay?

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:16.660
But if you do have the discipline to follow
up, and you do remember the specific details

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.640
of what I told you the first time you and
I had a seven minute conversation, I'm very

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.640
impressed.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.660
You value my time, I'll do business with you,
because it's details and it's discipline.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.680
Make sense?

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:35.620
So follow up, the biggest sales, the biggest
commission checks, the most profitable opportunities

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:41.589
that I've had in my career as an entrepreneur,
typically happened after I reached out to

00:12:41.589 --> 00:12:46.110
the customer or the person I don't know, seven,
eight, nine, ten times.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:51.690
I mean, God knows how many times I reached
out to certain people before I made the sale

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:52.710
because it was follow up.

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:53.810
But here's what I did know.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:57.180
I had very simple scripts that I would use
when I'd leave a phone call.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.640
This is what my call would sound like.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.180
I would say, hey, John.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.750
Patrick, right now it's not a good time.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.720
I'm just really not interested right now.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.720
At this phase of my life.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.720
. . Perfect.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.720
There's two ways that I can react to that.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.160
I'm rejected or my other question is what?

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.630
John, would you mind if I follow up with you
six months from now?

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.470
Maybe somewhere around February.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:19.470
Would that be okay with you?

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.580
You know what Patrick?

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.580
That's not a problem.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:22.580
Excellent.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:27.510
Well listen, John, since I'm not going to
talk to you between now and then, Happy Halloween,

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.200
Happy Thanksgiving, and Happy Holidays.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.560
And I'll talk to you in February.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.500
Hopefully before Valentine's Day so I'll be
able to wish you a Happy Valentine's Day.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.910
I like your attitude Patrick.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.120
Okay, take care, John, I'll talk to you in
February.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.120
Bye bye.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:45.640
Make a note, add details of what to bring
up - daughter, son, family, friends, etc.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.640
etc.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.640
You add the details.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.060
Then you call in February.

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.010
In February if they don't pick up, here's
how I leave a message.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.670
John, this is Patrick giving you a call.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:14:00.210
Again, I haven't spoken to you since August,
Happy Halloween, Happy Thanksgiving, Happy

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:05.040
Holidays, Happy New Year, and I'm hoping I
can wish you a Happy Valentine's Day, because

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.040
it's a week away from now.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.500
But look, I know you had a thing going on
with your daughter in November, her wedding

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.300
was coming up, I just wanted to call you.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.800
I'm sure you thought I forgot about you.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.800
I haven't forgotten about you.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.540
I'm looking forward to seeing if this is a
good time for us to do something.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.380
Something special has just come up with what
we're offering right now with our products.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.920
I'd love to tell you more about it.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.060
What's the best time for us to call?

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.920
Here's my phone number again.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.350
. . But I left a message.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.510
Whether he calls me back or not, it's irrelevant.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.200
Discipline, details, he's impressed.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:35.920
Then I'm going to call him again, two to four
weeks later, until I get ahold of him.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.700
Then again if he tells me not interested -- John,
would you mind if I call you six months from

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:41.700
now.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.700
Not at all, Patrick.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:43.700
Great.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.700
I will call you in August.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.240
So between now and then, guess what?

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.520
. . . I know this sounds to some of you - -maybe
you listen to this and say, Oh my gosh, Pat,

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.520
are you really like this?

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.700
Yes, because this works.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:54.980
Sales is so easy.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:55.980
My gosh.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:00.040
This is absolutely -- I am amazed when some
people are not making a quarter million dollars

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.040
a year selling.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.850
This is the easiest thing you'll ever do.

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:05.730
But the details and discipline is really what
it's all about.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:06.730
So follow up.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:07.730
Next, referrals.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:08.730
What's referrals?

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.350
So a lot of times, think about it this way.

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:18.910
A lot of times in sports, you ever seen when
one of these guys shoots the basket like a

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:19.910
Nick Young.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:21.250
I don't know if you know who Nick Young is.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:23.029
He played for the Lakers.

00:15:23.029 --> 00:15:24.491
I don't know why the Lakers ever signed him.

00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:26.970
It's because there was nobody on the league
for them to sign.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.020
But they signed Nick Young.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:30.210
Okay.

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:31.710
So he's got a decent shot.

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:35.390
So there's this one time in the game, he shoots
the three pointer and he turns around like

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.130
this and was walking away, that he's so confident,
and guess what?

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:39.130
It didn't go in.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:40.130
He looked like a fool.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:41.890
It was an ESPN highlight.

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:45.630
If you go on YouTube and type in "Nick Young,
missed three pointer turned around" you'll

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:46.630
see the video.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.240
It's so embarrassing.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.399
Some sales people are like that.

00:15:51.399 --> 00:15:52.790
They go in and they close the deal.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.000
I got the signature.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.970
Everything, man, this was so cool, and they
walk out and they forget.

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.160
Man, you just made two thousand dollars.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.459
And there's like $100,000 here [at referrals].

00:16:02.459 --> 00:16:04.930
What are you doing? stay.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:06.089
Relax.

00:16:06.089 --> 00:16:07.089
Don't celebrate.

00:16:07.089 --> 00:16:08.170
The game's not over yet.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:09.950
You've still got to play defense.

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:11.529
Referrals is what keeps you in business.

00:16:11.529 --> 00:16:12.529
That's your defense.

00:16:12.529 --> 00:16:14.500
So I've got to figure out a way to get referrals.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.450
So then the next leak is referrals.

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:21.370
How many referrals do you average per client,
how do you ask for referrals?

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:22.399
What is your referral script?

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:24.240
Do you have a referral script?

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.240
When do you ask it?

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.990
Do you prepare them or do you all of a sudden
say, "Surprise!

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:29.130
I want referrals!"

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:35.610
Or do you say in your presentation, "John,
I hope you understand the way I make my living,

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:36.750
I don't work for a salary.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:38.360
I simply make a living based on referrals.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:43.080
So referrals is my main source of keeping
me in business and I hope that I earned your

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.130
trust to the point where you're comfortable
maybe later on we meet or later on in the

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:49.459
presentation if you feel good about what I
have to offer to you, you're comfortable giving

00:16:49.459 --> 00:16:50.890
me referrals, right, if it makes sense.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:51.930
Yeah, of course, sure.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:52.930
You agree.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:53.930
No problem.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:54.930
Boom.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.310
Then at that presentation I say, hey, do you
remember when I told you earlier last time

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:01.519
we were together that my business is purely
on referrals and I said if it made sense and

00:17:01.519 --> 00:17:05.870
obviously we're doing business together so
who do you know that.

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:08.730
. . and you ask for referrals.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.089
Piece of cake.

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:12.839
But don't be a Nick Young shooting a three-pointer.

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:15.900
Come back around and play defense; you're
about to lose the game.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.410
Defense wins championships.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:18.410
Come back.

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:22.329
Then the Broncs won a championship last year,
not because Peyton Manning was having his

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:23.329
best season.

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:25.260
They won because their defense was one of
the greatest ever.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.260
Referrals.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.260
Now the last one.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:28.360
What's the last one?

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.250
Man, the last one is so important.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:34.000
Man, the last one is so important.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
But it's boring.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.290
So let me explain to you why it's boring.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:42.290
Okay.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:43.290
So think about it this way.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:46.430
And I'm going to use this analogy because
it's effective.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:51.340
You know, a lot of times, we want new things.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.340
We want a new girlfriend.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:58.000
It's kind of cool, man, a new girlfriend,
a new boyfriend, a new new, new, new -- everything

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
is new.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:06.170
I want a new. . . and then, what we don't
realize is the most powerful things that have

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:11.410
ever been built, we want a new industry, new
product to sell, it's so exciting.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:20.650
The most powerful people in the world -- sales
people, business people, leaders, influential,

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:23.380
they generally chose one route and they stuck
to it.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:27.260
And they maintained the industry, that relationship.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:35.020
So maintaining your customer relationship,
this is when you go into saint status, type

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.380
of figure.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:37.460
If you know how to maintain relationships.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.660
What do I mean by maintaining relationships?

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:43.880
To me, you know, I love to maintain people
that stay with me for a very long time.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.291
A strong team is very important to me.

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:47.650
So my job is to make sure the company is doing
very good.

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:49.890
My job is to make sure that the environment
is a great environment.

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:52.830
My job is to make sure that everybody's growing,
we're developing, and I'm outgrowing everybody

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:54.660
because I'm leading them at the front.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:58.490
My job is to make sure there's an edge going
on and we're competing, we're growing, everyone's

00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:59.490
coming up with ideas.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:00.490
Why?

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:03.020
Because I want to maintain relationship with
my home office, with my carriers, with my

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.550
vendors, with my following, with you.

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:07.850
I mean, we want to have an edge because we
want to build a YouTube channel, we believe

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.180
pound for pound we can go against anybody
on YouTube.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:14.420
You see a lot of channels on YouTube that
are purely motivation, motivation, motivation,

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:18.550
regurgitating, regurgitating, regurgitating,
regurgitating, same message over and over

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:19.550
and over again.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:21.130
People finally say, look, you keep saying
the same thing.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:22.130
We don't want to be that channel.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:25.320
We want to have a million subs on YouTube
because we have plans of what we want to do

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.470
to influence people around the world to make
a decision to realize happiness is linked

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:30.470
to being an entrepreneur.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:35.960
Because you create, you're part of a community,
and it's just kind of cool to have some kind

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.090
of an ownership of what you're doing.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.900
There's a certain sense of excitement that
comes from that.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.490
So I want to help more people become entrepreneurs.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:45.530
Whatever you're doing, this [maintain customer
relationship] is what matters.

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:46.530
You matter to me.

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:47.530
You're important to me.

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:48.530
I listen to you.

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:52.700
I got an email, I got a letter here, I get
gifts all the time, and if I talked about

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:56.910
the amount of gifts that I get, I'd be here
for a long time, but I get a lot of people

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:59.500
that also say Patrick, I want to take you
out to lunch, I want to take you out to coffee.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:03.200
I don't have time to say that to everybody.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.840
I'm grateful for the messages -- don't get
me wrong.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.650
But I just don't have the time to do any of
that stuff right now.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:14.120
I've got three kids, my traveling is hectic,
I'm running a company, we've got a lot of

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.380
things going on.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.380
But I was very impressed with this letter
I got from an attorney from New York.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.660
And I'll read it to you and I'll give him
some love with his first name and then I'll

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:24.740
tell you the approach he took.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.310
This, to me is impressive.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:27.970
This is the prime example.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:30.120
We get fan mail all the time.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.120
All the time.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:36.180
We get people that stop by and visit and they'll
say, "Pat, I'm in town, you have to say yes,

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:38.620
I just want to meet you for five minutes and
shake your hand; great.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.880
They'll come up, we'll shake hands, as long
as nothing is too creepy, great, we'll meet

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:42.880
them.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.620
We get some random strange things that happen
here, and we've got a lot of guards and all

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.330
that stuff to make sure we're protected.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.750
But I was so impressed by this letter.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:53.820
And so, he's an attorney out of New York,
John.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:56.350
I will give you love, John, and you know who
you are.

00:20:56.350 --> 00:21:03.940
It's a law firm out of New York, Astoria,
New York is where he's at.

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.190
So John, if you're watching this, you know
exactly what this is.

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:07.429
I want to read it to you.

00:21:07.429 --> 00:21:11.840
I want to read you his letter, and he's got
two cigars here for me, and this is not a

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.840
regular cigar.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.130
He sent me a nice, I want to say it's Fuentes,
I think it is.

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:17.130
Yes, Fuentes.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:21.170
Yeah, it's a Fuentes cigar, okay, good.

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.730
So it's a decent cigar, nice cigar.

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:24.730
Thank you, John.

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:27.059
Here's how the letter sounds like.

00:21:27.059 --> 00:21:29.360
I have been watching your YouTube channel
for a few weeks.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.490
And yes, I subscribed.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:31.700
[Thank you for the sub.]

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:37.210
I've infrequently watched various speakers
over the years and they were simply there.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:40.930
You, however, were presented and you made
me present.

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:43.530
You were able to grab my attention and hold
it.

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:47.270
It was so much your words or your plethora
of books on the wall, but it was your energy,

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:49.470
and your voice isn't annoying - family consensus.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.570
[Well I appreciate your family consensus.

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:54.309
Apparently somebody said the other day, "I
can't listen to his voice, he sounds like

00:21:54.309 --> 00:21:55.630
a porn star."

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.510
Which I've never been called a porn star before
for my voice.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:02.920
I don't even know what a porn star sounds
like, but apparently I have that voice.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.990
Okay, don't get distracted, I want to continue
with the letter.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.170
And then he says.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:10.010
. .] I now mostly watch your videos with my
wife and children.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:13.960
As you, I work with my wife, and I believe
we equally share the belief that we aren't

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:18.100
simply parents, but responsible for assuring
our children are leaders and not cattle.

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:23.230
Towards that end in addition to other books,
I make sure that my eldest child, 10-years-old,

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:26.809
reads certain books so that he may have the
opportunity to understand at an early age

00:22:26.809 --> 00:22:31.360
trials and tribulations that he will face
in life as he journeys to fulfill his dreams,

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:36.059
instilling in him -- I hope -- the belief
that he can accomplish his goals through helping

00:22:36.059 --> 00:22:41.440
others providing them, emphasizing that others
will perceive, must perceive the value or

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.440
there is none.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.630
A few books that he's read that I recommend
are the following books:

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:49.860
Dr. Seuss or Bob Berg [ a good book, the Go
Giver], The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:50.860
What books would you recommend.

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.840
What prompted this correspondence was your
video on how to work with family.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.720
I watched it online with my family and found
myself thinking about it the next day.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.040
I share your belief and practice as well with
my wife.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.480
But near the end where you discuss how you
would handle your children at the workplace

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:08.370
or potential business venture resonated and
impacted upon me, your dedication and discipline.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:13.200
Your content offers value to our family and
as a small token [listen to this, watch this]

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.650
and as a small token of my appreciation, I
offer an open invitation any time you're in

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:20.490
New York City to join me for fresh squeezed
juice.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:24.610
[He's a regular watcher so he knows right
now I've lost 17 pounds.]

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:30.059
Since you don't drink coffee [I don't drink
coffee], lunch or dinner would be fine.

00:23:30.059 --> 00:23:33.110
Perhaps you can challenge me to find a great
spot for liver.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:34.110
[Interesting.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:36.570
John, if you like liver, man, we've got to
go some Mediterranean place.

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.620
I just got to tell them how to make it.]

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.860
I am enclosing two cigars.

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:48.030
One for each of us, hoping you will save them
until we have our encounter.

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:50.260
I would enjoy the opportunity to meet.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:57.010
[signature] The enclosed cigars are short,
not because I want to limit our time together

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:58.480
but because I value your time."

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.860
Listen, man, John, I've got to tell you.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:07.150
I mean, you are pretty much an example of
how to do this part [referral and maintain

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:08.150
customer relationship].

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:09.150
You know, this is class.

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:10.150
I like this.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:11.200
I want to give John some love.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.010
So John, if you want to disclose that it's
you with your last name, you can comment on

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:16.010
the bottom.

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:17.010
It's all good with me.

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:19.590
If you don't, I'm giving you love for what
you did.

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:21.490
I'm impressed by that.

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:29.600
That tells me he probably treats his customers
that way, and he maintains customer relationships.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.840
See, the world of business -- and an attorney
is a salesperson, because you're selling people.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.820
A CPA is a salesperson.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:36.890
An accountant is a sales.

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:40.880
. . a dentist, a great dentist that makes
a lot of money, I know solid dentists in L.A.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.980
who make 2-300 grand a month.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:43.980
But they're sales people.

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.100
I went the other day and I was test driving
a Lamborghini.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:50.671
The guy comes with a Porsche and he bought
a brand new Aventador and I said, Hey, what

00:24:50.671 --> 00:24:51.671
do you do?

00:24:51.671 --> 00:24:52.671
And he said, "I'm a dentist."

00:24:52.671 --> 00:24:54.280
How do you make 200 grand a month as a dentist?

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:58.860
Well he makes 200 grand a month because he's
a businessman and a salesperson, on getting

00:24:58.860 --> 00:24:59.890
other people's business.

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:02.480
But I guarantee you there's some of this [maintain
customer relationships] going on.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.400
Without this, you aren't going to go to the
top.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.470
Very simple.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:07.010
Because they talk to one another.

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:09.660
You've got to learn how to treat them very
good.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:15.529
So again, as you look at this, people often
ask me, "Well, Pat, based on your opinion,

00:25:15.529 --> 00:25:17.210
which one do you think is the most important?"

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:22.440
Well let me tell you which one without it,
nothing exists.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:26.100
If you don't do this [prospecting], kiss it
goodbye.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:32.990
You know what's crazy?

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:40.820
What's crazy is, some of you who are watching
this, you are incredible at this [presenting

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:44.539
through maintaining], but you are so frightened
of this [prospecting].

00:25:44.539 --> 00:25:49.350
Because of that, you'll never make it big,
unless you face your fears here [prospecting]

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.150
and start doing this and this [prospecting
and approach and contact].

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:52.830
Because you know where the money's at?

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:53.950
The money's here [prospecting and approach
and contact.]

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:55.950
You know where the guarantee is at?

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:57.580
Here [follow up, referral, maintain].

00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:58.580
This guarantees you.

00:25:58.580 --> 00:25:59.860
This [presentation] means nothing.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:00.860
Very little.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:02.900
It means some, but not the most.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.060
This [prospecting and approach and contact]
is what's most important.

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:09.830
Any time, I always tell people, if your phone
doesn't run out of batteries twice a day,

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:10.830
you aren't working hard enough.

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:13.600
Your phone's got to run out of batteries twice
a day.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.650
Not because you're playing -- tell me some
of the games people play on the phone, Michaelangelo

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:29.350
- Angry Birds, Pokemon, Clash of Clans.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:31.670
Some of these things that people play, right?

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:32.670
Okay?

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:36.380
Your phone should be running out of batteries
twice a day because you're making 200 calls

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:37.380
a day.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:38.380
Okay.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.450
If you're a rookie entrepreneur, and you're
not making 200 calls a day, you're not really

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:41.450
hungry.

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:42.450
You're just kind of winging it.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:44.220
You're hoping this thing works out for you,
and you get lucky.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.820
There's a guaranteed formula to this.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:53.071
So with that being said, one, if you've got
any questions or comments about this, comment

00:26:53.071 --> 00:26:54.179
on the bottom.

00:26:54.179 --> 00:27:00.690
Two, if you haven't subscribed to the channel,
Michaelangelo, throw me my favorite pillow,

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:02.240
I need your help!

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.809
I need you to subscribe.

00:27:03.809 --> 00:27:05.330
Help us get to 100,000.

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.330
Share our content with other people you know.

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:08.940
We've been growing very fast.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:12.500
That last couple of months our YouTube channel
has, which is quite exciting.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.900
But our goal is to get to a million.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:19.120
Our short-term goal is to get to 100,000 subs,
on entrepreneurs to learn more about content

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.120
here.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.120
Again, subscribe if you haven't.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.120
And then what else?

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:28.120
If you watch this video on a completely different
website, you can always go back to PatrickBetDavid.com

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:32.100
and get all the content we offer for entrepreneurship.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.030
With that being said, thank you so much for
watching.

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:35.030
Take care.

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:35.032
Bye bye.
