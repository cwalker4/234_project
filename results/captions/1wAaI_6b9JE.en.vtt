00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Oh, wow.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.920
Calm down, calm down.
Psst!

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.580
That is the most efficient calming down I've seen in some time!

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.380
In fact it is a very well behaved audience. That is fantastic.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.340
Thank you all very much for coming along in such a polite, orderly fashion.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.480
Thank you very much Deborah — who has vanished! — for introducing me so nicely.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.240
As she said, my name is Matt Parker. I am here to talk to you about Things to See and Hear in the Fourth Dimension.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.900
Before we go racing into that, a little bit about myself –

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.060
Oh! actually, most of my information is up there. You can see my name is Matt Parker.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.640
I work at Queen Mary University of London. I actually used to be a maths teacher.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.680
Actually, have we got any maths teachers in?

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.920
[A few people whoop]

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.880
[some laughter]

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.880
All sat down in the front, brilliant. Okay. No surprises there.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.960
So I used to be–

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.120
Like, if you've been brought along by a math teacher, like one of your… fine, standard, normal math teachers.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.620
And…

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.840
[smirks]

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.860
[some laughter]

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.260
No math teachers are truly normal, are they?

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:26.820
I used to be a regular math teacher, and then I've gradually drifted into a much more varied career.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.720
So at the University of Queen Mary, which is a university in East London, I work in the maths department.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.840
I am the public engagement in mathematics fellow.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.620
[laughter]

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.380
You're laughing at my career, thanks for that. That's...

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.420
Don't – don't – don't patronise me.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.220
So we'll get racing into this. And, it is going to be a night of my favourite bits of mathematics.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.920
I'm going to show you my all-time favourite shape.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.720
It is pretty spectacular.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.720
And I am going to hopefully show you some other practical bits of mathematics along the way.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.820
But we will start properly by doing some mathematics.
So can everyone who brought their calculator... could you take that out now?

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.140
Really?! That is the most movement I have ever seen on "everyone take out your calculators." It genuinely is!

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.960
Has anyone got... Okay, I'm seeing a lot of phones. That is fine. Has anyone got an actual calculator?

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.040
Really?! Oh, that's so good. Is that a Casio? Very nice.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.240
Can anyone beat a Casio?
Another Casio.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.580
They're both from the FX series, it looks like from here. They're standard school-issue ones.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.000
Someone… Another Casio, very nice. No one's brought like a hilarious slide ruler or something?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.300
That has happened.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.440
What have you got? Oh, is that Texas Instruments?! Fantastic! Alright!

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.440
This is just my game of guess the calculator!

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.120
Okay, so whatever your calculation device is — don't feel intimidated now if you've just got your phone —

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.280
— I want you to type into it any two-digit number that takes your fancy.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.140
If, ah…

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.600
People that have been to the "Christmas lecture" filming, this is one of the things I do when I've got a lot of time to fill.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.500
So some of you may have seen me do this trick before, but it is one of my absolute favourite maths tricks.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.860
So what I want you to do —

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.040
— without talking —

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.220
— is to type in your two-digit number, then hit "multiply" and type in the same two-digit number again.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.280
Hit "multiply" and type in the same two-digit number a third time, and then hit "equals".

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.600
And what you have done, is you've calculated the cube of your original two-digit number.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.440
So it's two digits, times the same two digits, times the same two digits again.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.600
And what you've done, is the kind of long, tedious part of mathematics.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.800
The multiplying things over and over. This is why we have calculators. Alright?

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.720
The fun bit of maths, though, is what you can do with the answer.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.460
Is there anyone who has an answer on their screen?

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.020
They've cubed their two-digit number and they're prepared to share it?

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.240
Is there anyone who is happy to share?

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.480
Okay, I'm going to go with the very keen girl there.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.780
Yes, the one now looking nervous, pointing at herself. Yes. Could you…

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.600
Could you read out up there… Could you…

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.200
Is someone trying to steal your calculator?

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.020
You're like, "Wait, this is too much pressure, gimme that."

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.760
Alright. Okay. I think she can do it.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.780
Can you read out, what answer have you got there?

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.880
[GIRL] I got 17,576.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:25.180
17,576.
Okay, so you had to very carefully cube twenty…six, to get that.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.100
[applause]

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.860
Calm down, calm down.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.320
Who shouted "I did it?" Did someone else do 26?

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.880
[CHILD] No.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.860
No? But you did something else! That's excellent. Thanks for joining in.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.140
So… Actually what answer have you got on the screen down there?

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.400
Now that we have started what I believe is a conversation.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.180
[CHILD] 6,084!

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.380
Okay, 6,084.
Did you put in 14 and cube that?

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.920
[CHILD] No.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.340
No. Excellent. I regret starting this conversation.
[laughter]

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.360
So… I will come back to you. In fact, I suspect you're going to feature heavily tonight.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.240
I will come back to you in a moment so just wait there, alright?

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.240
So what I'm actually doing, by the way, is not a difficult calculation.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.320
I'm not doing a long, tedious cube root in my head. I'm doing a bit of a trick.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:26.220
And so I will do a few. I will do three in quick succession, and then if I get all three correct, you go the correct amount of wild.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.600
So is there one person over here who's prepared? Okay, I'm going to go, guy behind the sparkly hat over there.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.100
In fact, if this works you can have the sparkly hat as a prize.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.780
It's disappeared. There you are. You wouldn't believe they convert straight to gas at room temperature.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.340
Okay, so we got you in a second, remain calm.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.840
Okay, one over here… Who have we…

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.740
Okay, Miss reluctant lady right in the middle. You don't get a hat, I'm afraid.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.280
You know what? Forage nearby.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.140
And then, who over here? Okay, keen person over here.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.080
Who's taking your glasses off in shock. "Me?!" Yes! Right, okay, so!

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.460
So we're gonna do them in reverse order. In a second you're going to call your answer out. So many thousands and then the rest.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.420
And then we will come to... where have you gone. Over here. You're looking more nervous by the minute. It's fine.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.380
And we come over here to you, sir. And if I get all three correct... wild.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.280
What have you got on the screen over here?

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.000
[FIRST PERSON] 12,167.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.940
You put in... 23.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.960
[FIRST PERSON] Yes.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.340
[SECOND PERSON] 140,608

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.720
52.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.040
Okay, nodding silently is perfectly acceptable. Yes, and over here?

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.420
[THIRD PERSON] 704,969

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.480
Uh, you've put in 49.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.040
[THIRD PERSON] No.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.840
So… What was the number again?

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.880
[THIRD PERSON]: 704,969

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.060
Oh, 704 thousand?!
[laughter]

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.180
Uh… I suspect, at a guess, it's going to be 89?

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.560
[laughter]

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:03.760
[applause]

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.520
I don't entirely feel like I earned that.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.060
So, right. Now what I'm doing is, like I said, it's just a crude… I've got two rules.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:17.180
One rule that tells me the first digit of the original number. And the second rule that tells me the second digit of the original number.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.660
And I'm not doing anything other than just bluntly applying those two rules.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:25.340
So as you read it out, I'm listening to the digits and applying those two patterns to work out what they are.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.980
So if you cube something that's not a two-digit number, then I won't know.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.400
I will just take whatever the answer is and put it through the same algorithm.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.860
And if I mishear it… I thought you said 104 thousand, and I wasn't smart enough to know that it's not the cube of a two-digit number.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.520
So I still applied the same two rules.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:47.800
Now, the two rules, by the way, are incredibly easy. And if you knew what they are, you would not be impressed at all.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.120
Which is why I'm not going to explain them.
[laughter]

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.120
[disappointed murmurs]
But… If you wanna learn them…

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:58.520
If you wanna learn them, when you get home tonight, get a calculator, get some paper, get a pen…

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.220
Maybe invite some friends over… have a maths party.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.040
And you can serve triangle shaped snacks.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.480
If you cube a lot of two-digit numbers you will very quickly see the patterns come out, right?

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:16.580
So start cubing two-digit numbers, look for the patterns, and sooner or later you can learn what this is.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:22.100
But, to do something slightly more difficult… now this is the warm up over. Just something slightly more difficult.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.600
I've brought with me… And you can put your calculators away.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.300
I have brought with me one of my favourite maths toys. I have it here.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.200
It is the Rubik's Cube.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.440
I am gonna attempt to solve this for you live on stage.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:39.520
Before I do that, because people will accuse me of pre-arranging, I'm going to give it to you.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.820
Would you mind taking that, and mixing it up so that it's in a random arrangement.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.240
I'm gonna attempt to solve for you the Rubik's Cube.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:51.940
Oh, has anyone got a timer? Could one person get their timing device back up, who have I not interacted with yet. Yes, Miss.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.220
Okay, would you mind when I start…

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.300
If you're solving that, you're in so much trouble!
[laughter]

00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.520
Mix it up, alright?

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.300
I better get all the stickers back.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:08.040
And so, Miss, when I start solving it, you start timing. When it's solved…

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.940
Thank goodness; gimme that, gimme that.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.240
[laughter]

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.420
Thank you very much.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.740
Okay, so, when I start solving...

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.020
Are you just texting a friend?!

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.960
"You wouldn't believe what's in the show tonight." Alright, so you start.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.980
Have you opened a timer? You're putting your phone away now?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.280
It hasn't got a timer? Alright, so you said "No problem I'll time you" — you didn't even pretend!

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.620
You could have just counted the seconds.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.820
Okay, so you've now stolen a phone. Okay, does this one have a timer?

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.660
[GIRL] Yes.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.480
Okay. To be fair, this show is involving alot more admin than I expected.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.480
Could you, when I start solving it, start the timer, alright?

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.160
At the end, once I've got it — once it's finished…

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:56.360
When I finish it, no one react, alright? At the very end, could you call the time out?

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.640
If you deem that suitably impressive, you can start applauding.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.280
Okay, alright, here we go. So.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.460
And the time starts…

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.540
[GIRL] Now.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.000
[audience laughter]

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.360
Did you start?
[GIRL] No.
Good! Alright!

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.320
Only if I say "now", you start — but not that — you get the…

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.180
[audience laughter]

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.460
The time starts now!

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.840
Okay, right. So, people might think that a Rubik's Cube is famously very difficult to solve.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.920
So how on Earth can I solve it in a timely fashion?

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.740
And to be honest, if I don't get this done in the first 20 to 30 minutes, we'll just pack up and go home.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.180
[audience laughter]

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.660
I'd just call the show off at that point!

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.600
You can learn how to solve a Rubik's Cube.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.080
You can learn what combinations of twists, move different bits of it around…

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:44.220
And the current world record for solving a Rubik's Cube is 23.19 seconds.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.260
How long have I been going for?

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.080
Thirty! Oh, several people are timing me!

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.440
[audience laughter]

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.240
Why am I not surprised?

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:58.740
So anyway, I've been going for over half a minute, so… A more impressive me would be done by now!

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.660
But if there are any Rubik's Cube experts in — and believe me, it is very likely —

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:08.860
— you will know that 23.19 seconds is actually not the current world record for solving a Rubik's Cube.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:13.280
That is the current world record for solving a Rubik's Cube while you're blind-folded!

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.600
So… Yeah! Think that through, alright?

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.240
Someone was given a Rubik's Cube and proceeded to solve it in under half a minute.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.200
And in fact, there are all sorts of ridiculous world records for solving Rubik's Cubes.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.160
There's a world record for solving a Rubik's Cube while underwater — 19.01 seconds.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.220
There's a world record for solving a Rubik's Cube solely with your feet, which is currently 23.14 seconds.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.320
And I have solved it in…?

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.200
One minute 18.95?

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.760
[applause]

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.200
I'll take it!

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.140
Alright, so!

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:51.580
What I absolutely love about the Rubik's Cube, and the reason I could solve it, is…

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.440
Actually, I can bring it up on the screen, here, so if you can't… There we go!

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.440
That's a lot less flattering than I was hoping for!

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:06.220
The Rubik's Cube, what I love about it, is that it's a perfect example of a 3D cube.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.800
'Cause it spins in three different directions — it spins that way, it spins that way, and it spins that way.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.480
And when you're solving the Rubik's Cube,

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.380
the middle bits — those middle squares — never move.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.280
They remain perfectly still.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:22.140
They are effectively the 3D axis of the Rubik's Cube.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.240
There we go. And... Pause.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.540
Perfect, right, so...

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:33.360
So as I move it around, all I'm doing is, with reference to those points that never budge,

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:39.780
I've learned what twists in the three different directions move all the different stickers — or, well, different pieces, actually — into the correct positions.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:46.480
And with a bit of practice — it turns out all the instructions are on YouTube — with a bit of practice, you can learn to do it reasonably quickly.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:51.880
For proper nerd cred, though, under 30 seconds. And my best time is… I can just break a minute.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:58.740
I'm not brilliant. But I tend to solve it while socializing, so that's my attempt at a record.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.620
If people wanna have a play with the Rubik's Cube afterwards, please do come down and have a look at it.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.560
And the fact that it is a 3D cube, I think is absolutely brilliant.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:13.360
And my idea behind the talk today is eventually, via some practical maths,

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.400
I'm going to work my way up to showing you the 4th dimension.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.980
In fact, my all-time favourite shape only works in 4 dimensions.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:26.340
So, this is our 3D cube. I'm gonna try to work our way up to shapes that exist in more dimensions than we have.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.680
But it's fine; we're not going to go racing straight into it.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:33.620
We're going to gradually warm up, and we're gonna finish with a 4D version of the cube.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:39.800
So, before that, I have promised some practical mathematics. So I thought we'd just get that out of the way now.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.540
I'm gonna show you the mathematical way to tie your shoelaces.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:51.680
And this… I mean, you can save an incredible amount of time if you tie your shoes the maths way.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:57.600
So if I bring this camera around — because I'm well aware you can't all see my shoes, right —

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.300
– but if I set a camera up down here - I'll put it over here.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.780
So, in theory, if I get that there... Okay.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:12.040
So, if I put my foot in front of that, can you all...

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.820
[CROWD] Yeah.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.560
Oh, and you can see the one behind... Oh wait... Yeah, there you go...

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:18.900
[audience laughter]
[RANDOM CHILD] Cool!

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.160
It's like the world's nerdiest chorus line. Look at that!

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:25.400
Anyway, so, you can see my...
[repeated laughter]

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.320
This show is going in a lot of unexpected directions!

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:33.540
Okay, so you can see my shoelace here, in fact if I angle that down in a second...

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.500
It'll be a little bit less... there we are.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:40.500
Alright, so, I'm going to tie my shoe the mathematical way, and the way this works is:

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:46.000
You start with the two laces... With a foundation knot… And you just hold them…

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.560
And most people do some kind of ridiculous moving the laces around one knot, right.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.440
In reality, what you can do is once you've done the foundation knot...

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.120
If you just cross the two laces over, they'll tie themselves. Hence…

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.320
[weak audience reaction]

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.560
That's the correct amount of amazed!

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.200
[laughter]

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.620
Would you like to learn?

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.420
[AUDIENCE] Yes!

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:10.480
Alright, so, I'll do it again. I'm gonna give you a few seconds.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:15.440
If you've got shoes with laces, choose your favourite shoe, undo the laces.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:20.020
If you haven't got laces, odds are the person next to you does.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.060
[laughter]

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:26.420
And they're not using at least one shoe. So everyone get some laces within reach.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:31.420
[CROWD MURMURS]

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.100
Okay, here we go. Are you ready?

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.760
[CROWD] Yes

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:44.300
Okay, so, under the laces, do that foundation knot like what you can see. I've got tied on my shoe so far.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.900
Then, if you have a close look at the foundation knot,

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.500
one lace is going backwards and one is going forwards.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:56.620
So take the one that goes backwards, curl it up and over so it's going forward,

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:59.020
and hold it on the way down like that.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:03.580
And then take the one that's already going forward and curl it backwards and hold it on the way there.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:09.660
Now, all you have to do is take the two bits you're holding, put them under the other loop,

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:13.920
swap hands, pull tight, and you've got a knot.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.040
[CROWD MURMURS]

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.340
Is there a delay on that?

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.220
[CROWD] Yeah

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:27.000
Oh, sorry, so I'll do it again.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.960
If you missed it, just very quickly look slightly to the left, alright, and you'll see it again.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.160
So, here we go. I'm going to do it one last time.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:43.660
I'll do it again with instructions on the screen, and then I'm going to give you about 30 seconds to have a go,

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.700
and then we'll carry on with the talk. Okay here we go.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.200
So I'm going to untie my laces here. We have picture and picture instructions.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.440
So, you start with the back one curling forward - hold it on the way down -

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.460
The front one curling back - hold it on the way down -

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:04.420
and then you cross them both under the other loop, swap hands, pull tight, and it's done.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:10.180
The great thing about doing that: Not only will you save seconds of your life every day,

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:17.540
but the knot you end up with is mathematically the same as the standard knot you get doing it the really long way.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:23.900
And so you're not sacrificing knot quality, but you are doing it an awful lot quicker,

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:30.540
and I can say that it is mathematically the same because there's an area of maths called knot theory.

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:36.020
There are mathematicians called knot theorists — which is the best name ever — but they are theorists.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.620
They just look at knots.
[laughter]

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:41.500
And so… There may be a few puns in this section.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:51.680
And so knot theorists study knots, and sadly at the moment, humankind's understanding of knots is terrible.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.360
Humans are just... We are not good at knots whatsoever.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:03.940
And knot theorists do not have a reliable way to work out how to undo a knot.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:10.740
And so, for example, if I show you this knot up on the screen here — in fact, this is a picture from my book — that knot...

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:16.920
Oh, and the convention when you draw a knot is if the string goes underneath, then you just leave a little gap.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:20.620
So, where it goes underneath, it disappears briefly and comes out the other side.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:25.640
So they're not just little bits of string that go underneath each other and the rest.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:30.720
We have no idea what the best way is to undo that knot. No idea.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.680
And the way that we like to undo knots is:

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:38.560
You can choose one bit where the string goes underneath and you can cut it from underneath,

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.020
bring it on top and join it together.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:46.040
We call that a crossing switch, because you take one bit which crosses underneath and you switch it to cross on top.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:53.080
And at the moment, the world record for undoing this knot is three crossing switches.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:57.060
So, if you swap it in three places, it will come completely undone

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.740
and you will get a loop of string with no tangles in it whatsoever.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:05.140
No one has ever found a way to undo this with two crossing switches.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:10.460
No one has ever managed to prove you can't undo this knot with two crossing switches.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:15.500
It is an unknown, open bit of mathematics. It is called the ten-eleven (10₁₁) knot.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:21.500
I put it in my book, because what I want people to do is make it out of string and then have a go,

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:26.260
and it won't be in this arrangement, because people have tried all the crossing switches in this arrangement,

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:31.540
but if you make it in that arrangement, and then you pick it up and move it around so different bits cross eachother,

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:35.780
and then you make two crossing switches and take a photo of you pointing at them

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.460
– because if it works and you can't recreate it, no deal –

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:43.420
but if it does work, if you take a photo of you pointing at two bits,

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.220
you then make crossing switches at those two points and it becomes undone,

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:52.100
and you then send me an email, mathematical fame and fortune are yours...

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.600
...for a very narrow definition of fame and fortune.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.800
So, there are other ones. This is just the easiest one I've come across.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.040
Oh, I've had one email so far! The book came out in October; someone sent me and said,

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.760
"I did the knot!" I'm like, oh my goodness, so I invited a friend around.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.380
We actually had a little knot party; we got some string

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:15.680
and it turns out the knot they started with wasn't quite the ten-eleven.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:19.700
It was a different knot. We spent all evening. Eventually, we worked it out.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:24.380
I've left myself very open to string-based trolling, it has now occured to me.

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:29.720
So, please... only if you think you've got it... oh goodness... uh... send me an email and I will check.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.540
And hopefully, sooner or later, someone will do it.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:35.480
And mathematicians are working on having a much more systematic way of going about this.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.400
Instead of just having a go, trying to work out a way that given any knot,

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.180
you can calculate what crossing switches will undo it.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:49.380
And at the moment, bacteria are better at undoing knots than humans are. And that's not good!

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:55.040
Because when bacteria reproduce, they unzip their DNA and their DNA gets very tangled.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:59.280
And what they do is they have little enzymes that go around and perform crossing switches.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.720
They will snip the DNA on one side, move it around another strand, and join it back together again.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:11.040
And those enzymes in bacteria are more efficient at undoing knots in DNA than anything humans can do.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:15.960
And at the moment, biologists are working with mathematicians to try and work out first of all,

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.560
what the bacteria are doing, and secondly how we can stop them from doing it,

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:23.800
because if we know what they're up to, we can some how impede their ability to untangle themselves.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:33.760
And there's a whole future wave of medical ways that we can combat that bacteria if we had a better mathematical understanding of knots,

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:34.760
and I think that's absolutely amazing.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:38.000
It's a fantastic ongoing area of maths research.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.540
Umm. But up next is a slightly more fun maths you can try at home.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:47.880
So if you get sick of playing with string, I'm going to show you a fantastic activity you can do.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.000
Oh! I've brought some other things for show and tell!

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.800
Before I get to... Knots, right, are great, but there's a related area of links.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.940
And links are when you have more than one loop that go through each other.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.880
And there's a famous set of links called the Borromean rings.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.000
And they're pictured on this beer can.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.500
This is a beer can from the 1950s.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:13.220
I spent ages stalking it on eBay.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.400
I eventually, uh, managed to buy one.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:19.500
It's the one in the picture here. You can come and have a look at it if you want to afterwards.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:25.520
And the reason I really wanted it, is the logo is a mathematical set of rings, they're called Borromean rings.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:33.960
And the way they work, the way those three links go through each other, if you break any one of those three loops, the other two will come apart as well.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.200
So it only holds together as long as all three are intact.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.940
You break any one, the rest separate.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.820
So here you can see they put purity, body, and flavor.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:47.300
Because if you remove any one of those from your beer the beverage just falls apart.

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.480
And, I thought that's an amazing mathematical logo.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.440
And you can do it for more links, you can link four links.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.640
Such that if you cut any one the other three come apart, and it works for any number.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:04.680
For any n links, you can arrange them in such a way that if you cut one, the other n-1 come apart as well.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:09.820
And I had heard rumours about this can; I finally managed to buy one; I was so pleased.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:18.020
Recently, I was in New York doing some maths talks, and I went for a bit of a walk before one of my talks I was doing.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:22.800
And I walked past a billboard for the same beer. Ballantine's beer.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.780
They still make this beer.

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.240
And I saw it; I took a photo of me with it.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:31.580
I was so… I was so excited; I had no idea this beer still existed.

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:34.340
And so you can see how happy I am.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:40.440
But then, suddenly, my excitement turned to distress.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.560
Because
[laughter]

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.020
they have changed the logo!

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.200
[audience boos]

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.040
They've taken the crossing markings off the logo!

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:54.480
Right, and so I did the talking and in the talk I said right we have to get a bottle of this beer

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:59.480
afterwards we walked around several bars in New York demanding do you have this beer eventually

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.720
we found one that does. I smuggled the bottle back to the country there you are.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:08.940
So if you wanna I didn't declare it in the customs cause I have to put what you have brought in

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.700
an empty beer bottle full of disappointment...

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:15.680
and a.... so if you look up cause I brought the old can with me to the bar.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:20.280
So you can compare and contrast the two. I took a photo the next day in better light.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:25.320
Right so they had taken all the markings, people have tried to say that it's okay Matt

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:30.600
they have just turned it into a Venn Diagram. I am not buying that, right, they have ruined

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:35.600
all the maths, all that links, so I am very upset. So if you'd like to come afterwards

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:41.160
you can have a look of the original and the changed mathematical logo of the beer.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:48.580
Right, so. On to an activity you can try yourself at home. I'm gonna show you now

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:55.200
my all time second favourite shape. This is not the number one favourite shape; we'll work our way up to that

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.480
but my all time second favourite shape, and to make this

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.780
Oh, this is not my second favourite shape, by the way.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.520
This is a rectangle.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:04.400
[laughter]

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:09.420
I mean, don't get me wrong, big fan, but we can do better than just a straight up rectangle!

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:14.560
What you can do is, if you get a rectangle that is sufficiently skinny, and you join the two ends together

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.260
You get a loop.

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:20.240
The technical maths name for this is a boring shape.
[laughter]

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:26.100
You can make it an exciting shape by taking the two ends apart, turning one of them over, so when you

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.680
stick them together, you get a loop with a twist in it.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:36.280
Now many of you -looks like the sort of people who come along to these things- would have seen one of these before.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:40.720
It was invented by a guy called Mr. Möbius in the late 1800s.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:44.860
And he was so excited when he made what we now know as the Möbius loop

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:48.360
that he proceeded to name himself after the shape.
[laughter]

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.220
And, uh, the great...

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.980
Not everything tonight is a fact; I should make that very clear.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.680
So, the craziest thing about the Möbius loop, it has got all sorts of unusual properties.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:02.060
So, some of you would have heard that is only got one side it also has only got one edge, which is amazing.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:09.520
And there's all sort of strange things; but the best thing you can do with a Möbius loop is an activity when you've got two of them,

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.600
which are exactly the same length

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.300
and to get two the same length, you can see I have used paper reasonably wide.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:20.980
If I make a single snip in the center there and because I originally taped it all together at once,

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:25.060
I cut through the tape, I'm gonna get two loops precisely the same length.

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:29.460
Okay, so I get back to where I started, and so now I have cut that in half...

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.180
I've…

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.140
What?!

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.120
[laughter]

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.060
I've just blown your minds!

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:42.440
Alright, so the Möbius loop can't be cut in half.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:47.940
I genuinely cut it in half, like I properly cut right down the center, there's no funny business there.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:54.160
If you cut a Möbius loop in half, you end up with one piece, a single loop.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.260
And that just freaks me out.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.960
[laughter]

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.320
But it gets worse...

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.760
If you take a longer rectangle to start with,

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:07.220
this time when you start with your zero twist cylinder,

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:19.080
instead of doing one twist, if you do one, then two, then three, you gets what's called a three twist mobius loop.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:24.560
And if it seems at all familiar, it's because it is the recycling logo, there you are.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:25.680
[laughter]

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:31.140
You know, the next time you're walking down the street and you see the recycling logo, you can go

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.100
"Hey! That is a three-twist Möbius loop!"

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.460
[laughter]

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.140
That only works if there is someone next to you.

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.360
[laughter]

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.500
You'd look insane otherwise.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:45.840
Anyway, right so, a three-twist Möbius loop, I'm going to do exactly the same thing again

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:46.780
and I'm going try and cut it right down the center.

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:48.360
In your own minds,

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.540
without calling it out, I want you to see

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:56.100
if you can guess once I cut right down the middle of a three twist mobius loop,

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:59.360
how many pieces of paper will I end up with?

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.640
Will it still be one loop?

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.340
Will I get two? Or will I get three?

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:04.980
In your own minds decide...

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.020
Okay, turns out I get -

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.100
that

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.240
give it a second - here we go

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:15.660
Is it one, is it two, is it three? Is it two?

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:21.160
Turns out it is one, it is a single loop but now there is a knot tied in it.

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:29.460
Right, so, I started with a loop of paper with no knots, I cut it down the center and it tangled itself,

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:31.040
at no point did I undo the loop.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:36.100
So somehow a knot got it there, oh and for any knot fans in that is a trefoil.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:41.860
And so (some of you will be here!), I can't get rid of it, it is like a trivial knot - it is properly in there.

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.900
In fact it takes one crossing switch to get rid of it.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:53.140
And actually that is how the knots get in DNA. Because DNA is a very very twisted, very long strand,

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:57.460
when it reproduces it unzips down the middle, just like I did you cut it right down the middle

00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:01.360
and by cutting a twisted loop in half it ties itself in knots.

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:09.180
Some bacteria and apparently some human cells (not a biologist) have circular DNA, so it ends up very very knotted.

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:15.140
Even if the two ends are not joined together, by cutting a tangled thing in half it gets incredibly knotted.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:20.480
And so that's where the knots come from when DNA reproduces, and you have to do crossing switches to get rid of them.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:25.780
But the fact that by cutting a loop you get a knot really messes with my head.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.900
But it gets worse...

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.340
[laughter]

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:36.940
I skipped right over our friend the zero twist, because this is quite a boring shape,

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:41.200
if I was to cut this in half right in the center I would just get two zero twists.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.120
Not that exciting.

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:45.920
I'm gonna make one slight change, I have got another cylinder here

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.500
I'm gonna stick both of them together at right angles.

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:54.440
I'm them going to cut them both in half while they are stuck together.

00:29:54.580 --> 00:30:00.860
Oh, and if any of you are going to try this at home afterwards (and a lot of you are!),

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:08.180
make sure you put plenty of tape on both sides because if you don't tape it together sufficiently, it will become undone.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.120
while you're cutting through them.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.120
there we go, right, so again in your own mind

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.120
without calling it out without ruining it for anyone else

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:18.100
see if you can guess how many pieces of paper I'm gonna get.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:21.700
And, if you think you've got a good guess of that…

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:26.840
Have a guess what shape or shapes those pieces of paper will be.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.120
Right through the first one, we get that...

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.000
Right through the second one...

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:36.240
And I end up with…

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.380
A square!

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.340
[audience is delighted]

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:42.240
Yeah!

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.620
[applause]
Yes!

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.180
[applause]

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:48.180
So good!

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:50.980
SO good.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:51.960
[laughter]

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.280
Most of the audience who are down here -

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.280
- and you are all my favourites

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:02.820
Anyone arriving late or other people who now look shocked

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.240
Are sat at the very top over here

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.300
And occasionally people have been popping in, particularly people who work at the RI

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:10.520
Because they're like what is this maths comedy thing all about

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.340
So they've been coming in

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:15.120
It didn't happen, I was really hoping someone would come in RIGHT then.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:19.280
'Cause all they would see is me going, "Hey guys… A SQUARE!"

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.320
[laughter]

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:24.620
And you're all like "A square?! Oh my God, round of applause for the…"

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:27.240
[laughter]

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.940
Wait 'til you guys see a triangle! My goodness!

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.680
That's some advanced maths tonight!

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.640
Anyway!

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:37.700
I think that is amazing, that two loops both cut in half give you a square.

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.140
In fact you can reverse that to see why.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.840
If I put these two ends back together like that

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.920
If I identify those two edges, I get a strip of paper with a loop at each end

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.400
And if I then put those two loops back together

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.400
So that they line up

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:55.060
That's my original two cylinders at right angles to each other

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.680
You cut that one in half and you get that

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.920
You cut that one in half and you get a square

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.960
But it gets worse.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.340
[laughter and murmurs of shock]

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:09.700
Two Möbius loops stuck together at right angles!
[excited murmurs]

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.700
I am gonna cut!

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:13.700
This is the last one, there are no more down there!

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.900
I am going to cut -

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.160
- without talking -

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.460
- both of these, in half, at the same time

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:25.300
And then I want you to try and guess, in your own minds -

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:26.580
- without calling it out -

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:28.060
- how many

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.780
[audience talks]

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:34.020
- How many pieces of paper and what shape or shapes do you they will be?

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.920
Right, I have cut all the way through the first one

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.600
And I've got... that

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.660
Right ok, here we go

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:43.260
It will take me a second to untangle these when I'm done by the way

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.360
I'm cutting through the second one

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.140
And I end up with

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:58.340
[audience "aww"s]

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.320
Two hearts that go through each other!

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.400
[audience excited]

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:11.160
[applause]

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:14.460
Too late!

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.440
Alright so I held these up and you were like "nah..."

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:21.100
And then there was just silence and one person went wait a minute...

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.240
We applauded the square...

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.240
[laughter]

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.860
If we don't applaud this we're officially dead inside

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.820
It's too late though

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.600
So that is absolutely brilliant, right?

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.900
You now know what I gave my girlfriend for Valentine's Day last year!

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:34.880
[laughter]

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.420
Two Möbius loops and a pair of scissors!

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:37.400
[laughter]

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.040
And instructions!

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:43.100
Oh, and we got married! Last July! So, you know — boom! It works!

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.620
[applause]

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:49.960
That is the most expensive maths proof I have ever done.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:55.220
The wedding ring is iron-nickel meteorite

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:57.680
It's a very different talk... See me afterwards.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.040
What a substance!

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.740
Anyway, so, that is absolutely brilliant!

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.720
If you want to make one of these

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.820
There's a secret to bear in mind

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:09.000
When you make a mobius loop, you're actually faced with a choice

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:11.820
You can either twist it to the right

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.560
Or you can twist it to the left

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.740
And you get a right handed or a left handed mobius loop

00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:19.060
They're mirror images of each other

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:19.900
They're different shapes

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.880
For the hearts to work

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.880
You gotta have the right handed attached to a left handed

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:30.040
If you attach them both, and they're both the same twist, then you don't get two hearts.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.540
You get, like…

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:32.620
…a boat.

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.200
[laughter]

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.440
And a thing, I dunno.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:39.540
And they're not even joined together! It is a world of disappointment!

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.980
Oh, teachers!

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.780
I've just planned your next lesson back!

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.580
This is so good, particularly with sixth formers

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:48.660
Because if you do this with sixth formers

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.060
You do the whole lesson like that -

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:51.560
- If you send me an email, I'll send you the worksheets -

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.200
And as you go along at the beginning of the lesson you say

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:59.140
"Alright class, make sure to pay very close attention and follow all the instructions very carefully"

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.700
And they're all like "pfft, please!"

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:02.660
"Follow instructions?!"

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.900
And then you don't tell them about the twist

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:08.680
And a third of them by accident will do it right, and get the two hearts

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:11.360
And the rest will get the boat and the thing

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.260
And then you walk around going:
"I told you to pay attention!"

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:18.180
They'll do it again, and they'll do exactly what their friend's doing

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.120
And it worked for their friend, but it won't work for them

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.180
Then their head will explode

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.780
[laughter]

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:25.360
I still miss teaching sometimes...

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.040
It's absolutely great fun

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:30.240
But I wanna get to my favourite shape

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.580
Which is in the fourth dimension

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:35.220
I'm now going to show you what the fourth dimension looks like

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.960
We're gonna come running at this

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.100
A lot of people are vaguely familiar

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:45.980
With dimensions from an area of maths you might not expect

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:50.000
So when you're at school you will have been forced to draw charts

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.940
You will have been forced to plot things on graphs

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.880
And when you were doing that, you were actually working with dimensions

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:59.820
And so in two dimensions, you've only got two directions you can move in

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:02.100
You've got up and down, and you've got left and right

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:07.200
And that's an x-y axes graph, where you plot things onto it

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:11.240
And infact you can start plotting a variety of co-ordinates

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:12.660
And I've put on here

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:16.460
All the combinations of zero and one

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.620
And you do this quite a bit

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.640
You do it in maths because it's fun

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.580
You do it in science, because if you've done an experiment

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:25.480
And there's two different things you're measuring

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:30.760
Then you can plot two bits of data simultaneously as data points on an x-y co-ordinate

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:31.860
Infact

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.800
More people should use two dimensional plots than they do

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.240
Most stick to one dimensional plots, which I think is ridiculous

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.680
For example the football

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.140
The football premier league

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.360
Have a league table with only one dimension

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.680
It's just straight up and down

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:53.160
You could, if you wanted, plot all premiership teams in two dimensions

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.520
And you'd get a 2d league table

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.060
It would look a little bit like this

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.680
I've plotted net wins

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.400
That's the number subtract the number of losses

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.220
None of this two points ridiculousness

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:12.200
And then on this one here, I've plotted the number of goals scored subtract the number of goals conceded

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:16.260
As you can see some teams have scored a negative number of goals

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:23.460
So now at the end of the season you just calculate which team is the greatest distance from the origin

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.660
And they win, it's all very straightforward

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.360
I can't believe they haven't implemented this!

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.820
You can use arguments to solve arguments

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:35.800
If you're trying to spot your favourite team, there you go

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:38.920
I think that

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:41.600
[audience excited]

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.020
You've already gotten more sport than you were expecting

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:45.080
Don't be disappointed

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:47.620
You can plot great things in two dimensions

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:51.520
In this case you've done all the combinations of zero and one

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:55.240
Then what you've actually done is plotted the co-ordinates of the corners of the square

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.620
We can do the same thing in three dimensions

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:01.120
We've now got three different directions in which we can move in:
Up, down, left, right

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.680
And now you've got out

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.560
This is the reality we live in

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.180
We have 3 directions we can move, up and down, left and right

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:10.100
And out and back.

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:13.440
And then combinations of those, so we can go across and out.

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.060
Or we could just take a shortcut there.

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:20.500
And if you put on every combination of zeros and ones when you've got 3 coordinates

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.020
And so in science this happens quite a bit

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:26.960
you do an experiment with 3 different types of data

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.960
You can plot it on a 3D plot

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:34.160
But if you join together all the combinations of zeros and ones, on a 3D plot

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.300
You get the corners of a cube.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.840
You can now do this one dimension higher.

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:46.040
If you had a 4D plot, and the problem here is we can't imagine that.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:51.000
Because for a 4D plot you'd have left and right, up and down, out and back,

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.260
And then another direction.

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:55.520
Another direction that we just can't even try and visualize.

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:56.280
Which is a real shame.

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:58.280
But, it would be very useful.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:02.760
In science, you'd do experiments where you have 4 different things you're measuring.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.960
If you've got 4 different types of data you wanna plot on the same graph

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.340
You need a 4D plot.

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:12.200
And you can do this, but sadly you can't see it easily.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.200
So you lose that visual link.

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:22.960
But, there is still a few, well, there are a few ways you can visualize what a 4D cube will look like.

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:27.740
And, I'm going to try to show you tonight what a 4D cube would seem like

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.700
And to do that, what's really handy is,

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:36.480
To imagine how we would show a 3D cube... to a 2D creature.

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:41.080
So, if you had a 3D cube and you wanted to show it to someone who is perfectly flat, right

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:45.360
You could take a cube.. one way is to take your cube and then

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:47.720
unfold it into it's net

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:52.100
So that is one way to go down a dimension. You can take a 3D cube and unfold into it's net.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:57.580
In fact, what I have here is a video of a net folding and unfolding into a 3D cube

00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:59.580
Oh! I am not trying to patronize you

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:04.980
But, are we all happy, that is a video of a 2D net folding into a 3D cube?

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:08.500
[Audience: gentle whisper]  Okay. 
Wow, mixed, okay.

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.800
Because it's not.

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:13.860
That is not a video of a 2D net folding into a 3D cube

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:18.940
That is a video of the shadow of a 2D net folding into a 3D cube

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.420
Right. At the top there, I have got the 3D cube

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.760
I can then unfold it into it's 2D net

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.200
All I was showing you before was the bit underneath..

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:30.200
You can see there is a light above it and is casting a shadow onto that flat surface

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:34.120
But your brain is so used to things being in 3D

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:38.080
That when I showed you the bottom bit.. your brain imagined the top bit

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:41.400
Oh! You are, ofcourse, now watching this projected on a wall

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.500
But don't think about it for too long. Right!
[Laughter]

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:46.520
And so,
Just take the essence, okay! Right, so [Laughing]

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:50.620
What you are looking at the bottom there is the shadow of what's happening above it

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:53.580
But you can reconstruct the situation above

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:56.020
just by watching the shadow underneath

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:58.880
And what's great is, just like 3D objects

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:02.460
can cast 2D shadows..

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:07.520
4D objects can cast 3D shadows

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:14.060
So, even though I cannot show you an actual 3D object, what I can show you is the.. the 4D Object (corrected)

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:18.440
What I can show you is the 3D shadow of that 4D object

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:21.540
And so, what I've got here...

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:24.980
This is our 2D net of a 3D cube

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:30.880
What I have next to it is the 3D net of a 4D cube

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:34.940
And just like before, you could watch the shadow of this one

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.100
folding up one dimension higher

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:39.420
I am now gonna show you the 3D shadow

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:43.600
of the 3D net folding into a 4D cube

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.120
And it looks a little bit like this...

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.300
In it goes and over

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:52.540
[Audience: wow]
That's not so bad..

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.960
Now, if you watch the one that you're used to

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:58.620
If you start feeling a bit queasy.. in a bit "Dimension Sick"

00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:02.020
Right! Look at this side. Because this one's okay. This is safe..

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.700
And if you think about it

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.780
When the lid turns over on top of the cube

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:08.660
on this one, we are used to it

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:11.820
It looks like, in the shadow, it looks it stretches around

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.220
And we know it's not stretching around

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:15.600
We know it's just turning over

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.900
But when it turns over one dimension higher, it's shadow looks like it's stretching

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.040
So over here, that purple cube at the top is not stretching over

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.200
It's turning over

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:30.700
But when a cube turns over in 4D, it can look like stretches around in 3D

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.820
And the actual moment it's folded together

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:36.140
It looks like this, here

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:41.760
That is the 3D shadow.. of a 4D cube..

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:46.360
But because this is a shadow, it's been cast in such a way

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:47.960
that it's got "Perspective"

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:55.140
So, that blue cube in the middle is actually the same size as the red cube on the outside

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.380
Except, it's further away in 4D

00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.780
And when things get further away in 4D

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.340
they look smaller... In 3D, just like

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:06.480
if I showed you this.. You all know the blue square is smaller than the red square

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.620
You go.. Well, ofcourse the blue square is smaller than the red square

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:13.020
it's just.. it's the same size. It just looks smaller because it's further away

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.880
So you know red square, blue square, same size

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:19.260
But one looks smaller in it's shadow because of perspective

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:24.280
In fact, if you set this cube rotating, they take turns being the big one

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.940
Right! The blue one's big... And then the red one's big..

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.060
And it looks like they are going through each other

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:32.120
But they are not actually going through each other. 
They are going in front and behind

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.320
But if you just look at what's happening on the screen

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:38.360
The red and blue are at the same place quite a bit, they look like they are going through... there

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:41.440
And then they take turns getting big and small

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:42.820
I can do the same thing

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:47.180
I can take a 3D shadow of a 4D cube

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:50.360
And then I can set the 4D cube rotating

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.760
And (laughs), it looks like this

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:56.060
So now they are taking turns  being bigger and smaller

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:58.400
But they are not actually bigger or smaller

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:00.400
They are both still the same size all the time

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.820
They are just getting closer and further away in 4D

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.820
And they look like they are going through each other

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.480
But they are not going through each other

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:09.500
They are going in front and behind, one dimension higher

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.700
When they are going front and behind in 4D

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.920
from our.. you know.. pathetic 3D point of view

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.580
It looks like they are going through each other

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:22.680
At this point, if your head's not hurting, 
you are not paying attention.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:23.680
[Laughter]

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:27.380
Unfortunately, it now gets worse.

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:31.640
So, urm, oh!  If you want to try this yourself at home

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:36.880
You can build high dimensional cubes out of straws

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.320
I.. I... strongly recommend you do this

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:42.620
In fact, if you want to start with a 1D cube

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.540
To build a 1D cube out of straws

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:46.800
Pick up a straw and...
You're done!

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.800
[laughter]
There you are.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:52.560
1D cube, commonly referred to as a line.
I'm gonna use a red for the first dimension

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:55.300
If you then add some more straws,  you can make a square

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:59.220
So I have still got the red going one way, the blue now goes the other way

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:02.260
If you bring in a third colour,  I have got yellow

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:05.140
You end with a cube

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:08.920
And if you then get another cube and join it together

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.920
at all possible corners to this one

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.920
You get a...
Oh! oh sorry

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:16.140
That is the same thing..
I forgot.. I mean this is a new model I just made

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:19.360
Right! That is the same cube, but I have done it with perspective

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:22.560
So that's a perfectly flat shape, but it looks like

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:25.120
A 3D cube from perspective

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:27.380
Because what you can on dimension higher

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:32.340
Is you can make the wire-frame model of a 4D cube

00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:35.440
That's without perspective and then, this is with perspective

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.100
So I have shrunk down one of the cubes and popped it in the center.

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:39.900
And so you end up with this..

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:43.020
All the edges and all the corners everything is there of a 4D cube

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:45.020
But built out of straws

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:48.200
Oh! "Pipe-cleaners". Use pipe-cleaners for the corners

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.400
You just twist two of them together, cut off the extra bits

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.780
You've got a nice way to hook

00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:56.300
It's all explained in great detail in a book I can highly recommend

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:57.160
[Laughter]

00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:01.140
Aah.. Now, the other way you could look at higher dimensional shapes

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:05.320
is what.. is if you drop them into a lower dimensional universe

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:10.280
This is what happens if you take a 3D square and drop it into a 2D world.. Does that, right!

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:12.740
And if you were living in that 2D world

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:15.260
And someone dropped a 3D square on you

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:18.840
It would look like.. ah.. 3D cube - 3D square, same thing. Right!

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.200
It would look like a square appears and then disappears

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.640
So it comes in.. and then it goes out.

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.680
And all you would see is suddenly a 'square' and then 'no square'

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.460
You know that's not very exciting.

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:30.640
But we can do better.

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.200
If you drop the 3D cube edge first, looks like

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.220
a rectangle come in and then goes out again

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.600
So it's 'rectangle in', 'rectangle out'

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:41.880
And if you were a 2D creature, you would see a rectangle appear and then go away again

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:46.980
And what you are seeing is a kind of series of 2D slices through a 3D cube

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:48.420
And... ahh.. and

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:52.740
But if you were a 2D creature, you would have no idea what's actually happening.

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.500
All you would see are the slices come in and go out

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:57.960
You would have no idea what's going on over here
You'd see that.

00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:03.140
From that, you've got to recreate what a 3D cube looks like.

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:04.860
From those 2D slices

00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:07.240
I can now show you what it would look like

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:10.040
if someone took a 4D cube

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:14.400
And dropped it onto our 3D world, in a passed through, edge first

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.920
Looks a little bit like this..

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.400
In in comes, around it goes and out.

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.840
[Audience: shocked]

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.520
If you're ever walking down the street..

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:30.060
And you see this, a triangular prism appear in front of you, distort and go back out again

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:35.780
Someone is now throwing 4D cubes at you..
[Audience: laughter]

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.060
I recommend running (laughs)..

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:41.160
Alright! But it could be worse. Because you can drop things corner first

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.920
Here is a 3D cube going through 2D world corner first

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.780
You get a triangle that comes in, distorts and goes out.

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:49.500
Again, a 2D creature will have no idea what going on over there

00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:51.540
See, why that triangle comes in one way?

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:54.040
It goes through the space that's filled by hexagon

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:55.560
and goes back out the other way.

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:58.060
Alright! We can do the same thing one dimension higher

00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:02.400
If you take a 4D cube, when you drop it corner first onto a 3D universe

00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:03.880
It looks like this.

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:07.580
In it comes, around it goes and out.
[Audience: Wow...]

00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:09.680
[Audience: whispers]

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:11.900
If you're ever walking down the street (laughs)

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:15.060
And you see THIS come in, distort and go out.. alright!

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:19.440
Someone's out there, throwing 4D cubes at you, 'pointy' end first

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.960
[Audience: Laughter]

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:23.220
Somehow you've annoyed them.. (laughs)
Right!

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:27.600
Definitely run. Possibly put in a hat.
Sparkle's optional

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:32.340
Oh! That's why you wore it. You're like, "Well! Safety first with 4D cubes." (laughs)

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:34.800
Alright! So that is absolutely incredible.

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.800
Oh! And it's a bit like the triangle, one dimension lower.

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:39.600
But here, it's a tetrahedron.

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:43.160
It's a triangular pyramid that comes in, distorts and goes out facing the other way.

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.720
Absolutely amazing. But, you ask yourself.

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:49.420
Is this Matt's all-time favorite shape?

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.000
And, no.
It is not.

00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:56.240
Right! My All-time favorite shape is the 4D equivalent to the Mobius loop.

00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:58.380
You can make a Mobius loop...

00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:02.900
Oh, by the way, what I love about doing family shows at the RI --

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:06.980
because everyone's here in families, so it's all family units --

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:09.700
a lot of parents-and-kid...

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:14.180
My game, my play, while I'm talking is Guess Who Dragged Who Along?

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:16.300
[Audience: laughter] So good.

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:20.440
Often you see the parent, elbow go out, "Look! I told you: learn it!"

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:23.800
And often you see the parents just go, "I'm going to have to buy so much stuff when we go home."

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:27.100
Anyway, so my all-time favorite shape...

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:29.820
(It's okay, I'll finish on this, right?)

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.360
My all-time absolute favorite shape...

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:36.280
To make a Mobius loop... A Mobius loop only works in 3D.

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:40.260
It is a 2D surface but it requires three dimensions to join it together.

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:44.300
And we can extend the pattern into a higher dimension.

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:47.580
So when I made a normal Mobius loop

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:50.920
you could imagine that I start with a square

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.640
and then I join the two ends together.

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:57.200
And you can see here I've indicated with arrows how to join the ends together.

00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:01.100
So I want you to join the two ends together so that the arrows match.

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:03.540
We call them matching instructions.

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:08.220
And if you try and do that with a piece of paper that you keep on a flat surface,

00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:10.960
you can't get the arrows to line up.

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:13.540
If you try and stretch it around and put them together, they don't match.

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:16.440
If they matched, you'd get a cylinder with no twists.  Right?

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:20.160
To get them to line up, what you need to do

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:24.400
is take one end, lift it up and turn it over, and then put it down.

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:28.660
And to do that you've had to pick it up into the third dimension and put a twist into it.

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:30.540
And now the two ends do line up.

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:34.480
Oh, and if you are a 2D creature looking at this...

00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:37.180
you'd go, "Hang on! This is cheating..."

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:43.280
"...because it looks like this edge here just magically goes through the middle."

00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:47.600
The 2D creature is like, "You can't just put an edge in the middle of the face. That's ridiculous."

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:51.260
And we're like, "Oh, no-no-no, it doesn't go THROUGH.  It goes OVER."

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:57.220
But when it goes OVER in 3D, it looks like it goes THROUGH from a 2D point of view.

00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:01.400
Only in 3D can you fully appreciate the wonder of the Mobius loop.

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:03.780
Now to do it one dimension higher!

00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:08.820
What you do is you start with a piece of paper, but this time with more matching instructions.

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:12.660
I've got two sets of arrows: I've got the red ones and the blue ones.

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:16.160
And the red ones are easy.  I can join those together and I get a Cylinder.

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:19.200
I then have got to join the blue ones together.

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.340
And to do that I've got to stretch it around, I've got to line them up...

00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:25.060
Now, if they matched, and I joined them together,

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:28.200
you would get a tube that joins up with itself.

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.860
That's the shape that in Mathematics we call a 'Torus'...

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:35.960
...which, in Physics, they call a 'Doughnut'.

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.760
[Audience: laughter]

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:40.220
Physicists, man!

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:44.380
And so it is an amazing shape, the Torus (Doughnut)!

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:47.920
And so I've got a model of it here. It is an amazing shape.

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:52.920
You can do things on a torus that you can't do on a flat surface.

00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:57.000
There is a famous problem in Maths.

00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:00.080
If you want to try this afterwards, it's a great puzzle.

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:02.580
It's called 'the Utilities Puzzle',

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:08.000
where you've got three houses and you want to join them all up to three different sources of utilities.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.420
You've got the Gas Company, Power Company and the Water Company.

00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:16.100
And you need to join them up such that the pipes don't cross.

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:20.160
So you've got to draw a line from each house to all three utilities

00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:22.580
with no lines crossing each other.

00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:27.720
I called it a puzzle.  But what mathematicians call a puzzle, in this case, is impossible.

00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:31.700
Which is proof that mathematicians can be jerks.

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:35.300
You cannot solve this on a flat surface, but...

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:37.400
...if these houses were on a doughnut...

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.660
you CAN solve it.

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.540
In fact, I've got this mug which has this printed on it,

00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:45.320
because it's possible to solve it on a mug because you have the handle.

00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:51.140
A mug is the same shape as a doughnut because you have the extra bit stretched around.

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:55.700
Oh! any Maths people in: if you're familiar with the Four Colour Problem...

00:52:55.700 --> 00:53:01.440
any flat surface will need four colours or fewer to colour in any combination of regions,

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:04.440
so that no two contacting regions have the same colour.

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.720
On a torus you need seven colours.

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:10.600
And so I designed a mug with all seven colours on it.

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:19.320
I've got seven different regions and each one contacts all six other regions to show that they all have to be different colours.

00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:20.640
I've brought it along.

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:24.080
I you want to have a look at this afterwards, come down and have a play with it.

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.400
There it is, there. There is my seven-colour torus.

00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:29.400
Come down and have a look at it, have a play with it.

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:31.880
Absolutely amazing..

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:33.880
Torus, wonderful, love it.

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:35.540
It's a 3D shape.

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:37.560
We've all played with it before. You may have eaten one.

00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:39.420
We can do better.

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:43.960
What would a 4D twisted doughnut look like?

00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:52.380
And for that to happen, you need to join the two ends of this tube together, so they face different directions - so they twist different ways.

00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:57.340
But how do you turn over the end of a tube? You can't rotate it, 'cause it would still be clockwise or anti-clockwise.

00:53:57.340 --> 00:53:58.920
The only way -

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:03.000
to join the two ends of this tube together, so the arrows match,

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:08.060
is to shove one side through the other one, then fold it back, then join it up.

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:12.900
And then you get this shape. This is a twisted doughnut.

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:17.400
It is a shape called the 'Klein-Bottle', it only properly works in 4D

00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:22.160
because this bit here looks like it goes through the side - in fact i got a 3D Model of it

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:25.260
it looks like this tube goes through the surface

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:32.320
in 4D, it doesn't. In 4D it goes around, it's as good as a donut in four dimensions - it doesn't go through itself

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:38.400
Annoyingly, in 3D - this is the 3D Shadow of it - it always looks like it goes through itself

00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:42.140
Very disappointing, but what are you gonna do ?

00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:44.900
Because in 3D, you can at least make it, you can make 'em out of glass.

00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:47.200
4D glass - very expensive

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.160
[Quiet Laughs]
I have brought with me

00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:52.000
this one here, so if you wanna have a play with it

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.460
there's one down the front here

00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:57.620
it's called the 'Klein-Bottle', it's my all-time favourite shape, it's absoluty amazing

00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:59.520
actually i got more then one model

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:01.180
I've got another one here

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:04.160
which is based on a Conical Flask.

00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:08.500
Alright and so - all these are so good actually because -  alright

00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:10.580
- is this sink plumed in?

00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:13.300
We're about to find out!

00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:13.920
[Laughs]

00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:16.200
It's the RI I'm doin' experiments

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:22.040
If you pour water into ... the bottle, you can see it goes in fine

00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:25.920
look at that- right? and then if you try and get it back out again

00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:27.200
that's a lot more difficult

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:32.000
alright so, I just really I'm doing this over a national treasure right?

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.200
this is Faraday's desk and I'm there going oh look at the water right?

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:40.480
and so.. the world's first electrical motor was demonstrated right here

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.240
I made some hearts

00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:43.520
Ah right

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.160
so this is the least side of what's important though right?

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:50.560
actually next time you go to a party

00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:52.160
bring drinks in one of these alright

00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:55.840
it's so good because you of a bit like oh cheers thanks

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:56.960
What?!

00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:57.760
[laugh]

00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:59.040
but how did it get in there?

00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:01.920
right, so.. oh you can get it back out again

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:04.800
if you get it into the handle, it will go around the handle

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:06.400
and then out oh! look!

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:08.000
[laugh]

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.440
all over the floor

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:13.120
OK if you would help me drag the desk back on top of this right? and no

00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:16.160
so this right, if you want to play with this

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:18.240
take it over there

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.520
ah I'll leave it there

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:21.440
you're welcomed to come and have a look and play out with that

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:22.720
it's absolutely brilliant

00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:24.640
although as always people say

00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.400
right OK, so the Klein Bottle

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:30.240
it's a wonderful 4D - well it's a 3D shadow of a 4D shape

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:32.000
people would say what is the point?

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:33.760
what is the use of it?

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:36.320
well for a start it makes for a mighty fine hat

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:40.640
[laugh]

00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:45.280
you can knit the 3D shadow of the 4D

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:47.200
because so, I'm so excited

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.800
so when I realised that this could happen

00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:51.680
I went to my mum, right, because my mum can knit

00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:52.480
I said mom

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:56.800
you have got to knit me the 3D shadow of the 4D twisted doughnut

00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:58.400
so I can wear it as a hat

00:56:58.400 --> 00:56:59.360
[laugh]

00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:00.160
and she was like..

00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.400
"What have I raised?"

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:04.400
and in the mid of the conversation where I was talking

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.920
perfectly reasonable maths

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:07.680
but she was speaking fluent knitting

00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:10.540
but eventually we worked it out and we made one

00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:12.480
I've got it here

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:14.480
Right I've got a picture of my hat right there.

00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:16.260
So you can see...

00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:18.460
Oh, if you wanna see what it looks like when I'm wearing it

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:19.620
It looks like that

00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:20.620
So...

00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:21.720
[laugh]

00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:23.960
What happens, is the hat becomes a tube

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:26.220
The tube then goes through the side of the hat

00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:28.540
And then if I reach in there and I pull the tube through

00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:29.780
The tube folds back on itself

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:30.500
Right?

00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:33.820
This is a neverending tube of knitting

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:36.060
It's a doughnut of knitting that goes through itself

00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:38.740
And it keeps your head warm, it's so good!

00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:39.940
If you want...

00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:42.200
That is just creeping me out now...

00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:45.460
If you want the knitting pattern

00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:47.680
Seriously, send me an e-mail! I'll send you a copy!

00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:48.360
It's so good!

00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:52.820
So you may have noticed that this hat is stripey

00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:57.860
The first one of these my mom made for me

00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:00.200
Which I called "the prototype"

00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:03.580
Which she called "the perfectly good gift"

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:06.640
It didn't have any stripes, it was all the same color

00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:09.460
I said, "Mum, could you make me another one of these,

00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:10.480
that has stripes?"

00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:14.500
Well yeah, I can do that, I just change the color of the wool as I go!

00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:18.440
I said "Oh, good, could the stripes be different thicknesses, could I have thick ones and thin ones?"

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:20.960
She said "Yeah, I just do a different number of rows"

00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:22.520
I said "Ah, good, good..."

00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:25.600
What if I gave you a long list of numbers,

00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:29.200
Could you make each stripe the thickness of the next number on the list?

00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:32.860
And so this, Ladies and Gentlemen, these are the digits of Pi!

00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:35.100
And these are on a 4D-hat!

00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:38.660
This is officially the world's nerdiest hat!

00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:42.400
If you would like to meet the hat afterwards,

00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:43.740
I will leave it down here

00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:45.760
You can come and take a photo of you wearing the hat

00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:47.520
That is absolutely fine

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:50.420
If you can convince a loved one to knit it for you

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:52.100
Sorry parents!

00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:54.880
They come in a variety of sizes, send me an e-mail!

00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:56.380
Now...

00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:59.940
Very quickly, before we wrap up, we'll have a little bit of time for questions

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.320
The very last thing I wanna show you

00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:06.720
Before we stop for questions and then you get to go back into the real world

00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:09.300
Is what if, when you go home

00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:13.020
You wanna have your own 4D-shape to play with

00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:15.720
And you haven't got the time or effort to knit it

00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:20.700
Well, you can go online and play with a 4D-cube

00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:25.640
And the reason you can do that, is because online there is a 4D-Rubik's cube

00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:31.140
So, here's our standard 3D-cube

00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:31.880
Pöh

00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:37.500
Instead of trying to get 2D-stickers onto the 2D-surface of a 3D-cube

00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:43.840
Here you have to get the 3D-stickers onto the 3D-cell of a 4D-cube

00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:46.260
And to twist it...

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:50.880
If you click on one of the 3D-stickers, if it's the center of a rotatable face

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:52.640
It will then set it rotating

00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:56.700
And it comes back after two twists!

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.760
That's why people think USB-cables are 4D-objects

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:08.440
Because you gotta plug it in, doesn't fit, turn it over, plug it in, doesn't fit

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.160
Turn it over, Hey!

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:13.860
Proof

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:22.220
The problem is to solve it you gotta move it around in 3D

01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:27.320
Because what you are doing is grabbing and moving the 3D-shadow around in front of you

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.520
But you can still move it 4 different ways

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.540
So you got the standard 3 different ways you can drag it around

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:42.120
Turns out in the internet for the fourth Dimension you hold down Control, doesn't work on many websites

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.420
And then it will rotate in the fourth direction

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:47.860
So the outside pops into the inside

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:52.020
And there's always one face you can't see at any point in time

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:53.340
because you're in the wrong dimension

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:57.540
Oh, and one final problem

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:04.420
It looks like you're just moving around the 3D-shadow of the 4D-Rubik's cube

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:06.520
In fact though you're doing it on a computer monitor

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:09.400
And computer mice only move in two dimensions up and down, left and right

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:13.400
So what you're actually doing is you're manipulating the 2D-projection

01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:17.460
Of a 3D-projection of a 4D-Rubik's cube

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:22.440
And if that sounds too easy there is of course a 5D-Rubik's cube

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:23.880
[laugh and amazement]

01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:26.860
At which point I've gone probably too far

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:29.280
So I'm gonna finish there, thank you all very much

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:33.700
[Applause]
