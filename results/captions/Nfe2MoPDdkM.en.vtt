00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:28.940
When Mark Twain first emailed me about
the Mark Twain Prize I have to admit I

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:35.030
totally misunderstood, I assumed that I
was being asked to honor somebody else

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:42.380
who was receiving the Mark Twain Prize
and I thought, "Oh my god what a hassle.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.880
I mean, seriously, who would put me through
this?

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.380
I have to go all the way to Washington DC

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.360
which, no offense, is a nightmare 
and make up flattering things

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.080
to say about how funny someone else is?

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.040
No ——— way.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.760
(laughter)

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:11.540
And then, I reread the email, and I
realized, "Oh, it's me! They're giving it to

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.840
me! I get the prize!"

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.340
And my attitude about the 
whole thing changed, it really did.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.360
I don't know—honestly!
(laughter, applause)

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.980
I really don't know what I was thinking,
this is a great night, and a great honor

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.720
and in beautiful Washington DC no less!

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.079
Anybody would be lucky to be a part of a

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.120
night like this honoring 
somebody like me, right?

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.120
(laughter)

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.700
As a great fan of the 
work of Mark Twain I was

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.600
so sorry when I recently 
learned he was dead.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.960
(laughter)

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.040
My thoughts and prayers go out to the

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.189
whole Twain family

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.360
especially the wonderful Shania.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.960
(laughter, applause)

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.180
Unfortunately the President of the
United States couldn't make it tonight

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.600
either, even though he lives in the
neighborhood

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.780
Mondays through Wednesdays.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.180
(laughter, applause)

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:35.310
I am so lucky to have been on television
doing comedy for more than 35 years

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.650
isn't that ridiculous? It's, you know, the
really ridiculous thing is that I am

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.959
just as good at drama. Yeah, I'm gonna
tell you a little story, it's a little

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:53.140
trivia, the the very same week that I got
cast in Seinfeld, I was being considered

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.019
for the juicy little part of Portia in
director Sir Peter Hall's Broadway

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:05.620
production of The Merchant of Venice
apparently I didn't get the part since

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.980
someone else eventually played the role
on the stage and, you know, of course I'm

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.750
happy that I didn't get that part
because if I had, I would never have

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.640
played Elaine on Seinfeld, and without
Seinfeld I would not be here today so

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.530
you know it worked out great, totally
fabulous, no regrets here, none at all.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.360
None whatsoever. Anyway, 
I think it's time for me to get

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.340
into some serious thank-yous.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.280
Abbi and Ilana, thank you so much 
for taking time

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.799
out of your busy schedule just to be
completely clear I gave an excellent

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:51.579
audition for Merchant of Venice, okay, I
mean just objectively speaking now, I,

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:57.459
I nailed it, okay, so I'm just a little
confused as to why Peter Hall didn't cast

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:04.420
me. That's all, that's all. I'm not upset
obviously because I love comedy, and

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.940
I love my career.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.720
Uh, so, um.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.120
Where was I? Oh yes yes yes. Keegan!

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.480
Oh my god, Keegan Michael-Key!

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:23.669
I thank you so much for being here on my
special night look Sir Peter Hall might

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.960
have made a mistake. okay? 
My audition was

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.020
Portia's speech about 
mercy, you all

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.860
probably know the scene, I mean
obviously, I am NOT gonna perform it

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.320
right now, because that would be a pretty
weird tangent to hear Shakespeare

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.590
intelligently and energetically
performed in the middle of a comedy

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.320
tribute to me so, ahem.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.590
Kumail, thank you for being here. 
It is so inspiring that you

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.360
were able to co-opt your wife's
harrowing medical ordeal for an Oscar

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.980
nomination.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.000
(laughter, applause)

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:11.030
Bryan Cranston, you are a truly
incomparable talent and a pleasure to

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:17.990
work with, you know when I think of us on
Seinfeld, um—look, I'm just going to do it.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.040
You want to hear it, right?

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.040
I can do Shakespeare, okay?

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.040
(laughter, cheers)

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.400
(clears throat)

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.600
The quality of mercy is not strain'd!

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.360
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.900
upon the place beneath!

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.600
It is TWICE bless'd.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.400
It blesseth him that
gives and him that takes!

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:02.620
(laughter, cheers)

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.620
Thank you.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.620
Thank you.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:14.480
And Stephen Colbert, my fellow
Northwestern alum, thank you so much for

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:20.850
being here, you were my every night hero
when at 11:35 a nation turns its lonely

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.640
eyes to you woo-woo-woo.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:31.980
(laughter, cheers)

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.120
Stephen used to play a manic
conservative, and now he plays a

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.520
depressed liberal, THAT is range, 
ladies and gentlemen.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.620
It is so great to see Lisa Kudrow

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.329
here, setting me up just like in
the old days when Friends would set up

00:06:49.329 --> 00:06:53.729
Seinfeld, and just like in the old days
Jerry's, got all the money.

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:58.119
And my darling,

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:04.340
dear, sweet, Tony Hale. If I weren't
already married

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.740
and Bryan and Keegan
weren't already married

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.760
and if you weren't already 
married, then I'd

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:17.340
definitely get your opinion about any
guy I was dating before marrying him.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:26.140
(laughter, applause)

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:33.780
And Tina Fey, you are a comedy genius
whom I admire above all humans

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.460
Tina was honored with the Mark Twain
prize, too - you know before they got real

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.340
serious about who they
give these things to.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:48.880
And thanks to my wonderful neighbor Jack
Johnson, I was gonna make a joke about

00:07:48.889 --> 00:07:53.540
Jack Johnson, but for the love of God
can't something remain sacred this

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.720
evening?

00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:02.560
and finally to my wonderful
friend, Jerry Seinfeld, I learned a lot

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.740
from Jer over the years, principally, the
importance of hard work.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:12.320
Jerry killed himself to make Seinfeld
good. He and Larry David worked so hard,

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:18.740
it is, actually, it is impossible to
describe, and they didn't just do it to

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.370
make the show successful, because 
once it was successful,

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:27.680
they worked even harder, and I hope, I
hope a little of that rubbed off on me.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:33.620
I grew up here in Washington DC back
during the quaint, old-fashioned

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.280
"rule of law" period.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:42.700
(laughter, applause)

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.320
Being funny was a big part of my growing
up, my great-grandmother Bessie was the

00:08:48.329 --> 00:08:51.440
first person I remember telling jokes.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.420
She was in her 90s, and I was really

00:08:54.420 --> 00:09:00.140
little, and she would do these extremely
repulsive impressions of her first-grade

00:09:00.149 --> 00:09:06.480
teacher having life-threatening seizures,
at least I think it was an impression,

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.360
anyway!

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.379
either way, I realize now, that it was

00:09:10.379 --> 00:09:15.139
offensive, and she was way way out of
line, but when I was 5 years old

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.400
hilarious stuff!

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.720
My mom and dad got 
divorced when I was 3,

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.860
also hilarious!

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:29.320
My mom is actually here tonight 
with 80 of her closest friends.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:36.920
(laughter, applause, cheers)

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.040
Last year, I was lucky enough to get an
Emmy Award for my performance on VEEP

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.640
which was an incredible thrill and it
set some kind of a record for the most

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.710
Emmys by somebody for doing something or
other, and then about 12 hours later I

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:54.860
was diagnosed with cancer—
another hilarious turn of events!

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.000
I'm only half-kidding, of course

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.840
cancer isn't at all funny, but 
a big part of dealing with it

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.560
has been finding the funny moments.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.950
The old cliche about 
laughter being the best

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:10.870
medicine turns out to be true, which is
good because that's what the current

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:14.920
administration is trying to replace
Obamacare with.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:21.760
(laughter, applause)

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:28.320
When I was getting my hideous
chemotherapy, I'd cram a bunch of family

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.160
and friends into this tiny treatment
room with me, and we really did have some

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.290
great laughs, of course I was heavily
medicated and slipping in and out of

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:42.180
consciousness, so I was probably a pretty
easy audience, but my point is that

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:47.280
laughter is a basic human need along
with love and food and an HBO

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:54.090
subscription. There's no situation,
none, that isn't improved with a couple

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:59.640
of laughs, everybody needs laughs. So the
fact that I've had the opportunity to

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.990
make people laugh for a living is one
of the many blessings that I have

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.660
received in my life.

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:14.460
(applause, cheers)

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.560
According to Wikipedia, I have two sons,
Charlie and Henry.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.140
You know when you're a

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:28.770
working mother, you really worry about
the time spent away from your kids, you

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:33.960
try your best to be there as much as
possible, but the truth is that you

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:38.520
miss stuff, and you worry that they're
gonna just get all screwed up and suffer

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.060
all kinds of angst and neuroses when
they grow up and then you get the

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.960
Mark Twain Prize, 
I gotta say it's worth it!

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:52.260
(laughter, applause)

00:11:52.920 --> 00:12:00.520
I'd also I'd also like to acknowledge my
cherished husband Brad Hall, who I didn't

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.640
just marry because his name sounds like
Peter Hall and it kind of felt like I

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:10.570
was getting the part. Brad never fails to
show up at events like this very

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:15.910
one. He puts on a suit, he puts on a smile,
and is the most supportive and present

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:21.820
spouse in the world. Thank you.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.600
(laughter)

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.900
Thank you so, so much, 
dear Brad. Thank you.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:36.260
And finally, thanks to Mark, and Mrs.
Twain, and to everyone who has

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:41.160
participated in this exhausting evening.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.980
Thank you so much, and good evening and

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.340
thank you.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.580
(applause, cheers)
