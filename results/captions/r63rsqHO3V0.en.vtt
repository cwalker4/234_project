00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
Kamala Harris Mouths Off On Senate Floor Condoleezza Rice Smacks Her Down Hard

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.670
the chairman I'd like to restate my

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.320
objection from earlier for the record

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.109
which is my motion to postpone this

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.270
hearing a number of comments have been

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.100
made by my honored and respected

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.910
colleagues I'd like to address a few of

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.699
them one there was some mention of a

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.340
concern about Elena Kagan's hearing and

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.349
that the White House at the time there

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.700
was an agreement that those certain

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.290
records are sensitive and should

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.180
therefore not be disclosed it's my

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.980
understanding that is a point of

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.010
distinction between that time and today

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.629
that those were active cases in the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.789
White House and for that reason there

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.410
was an understanding and agreement that

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.840
they were of a sensitive nature and

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.940
should not be disclosed in terms of the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.289
point that has been made about playing

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.050
politics and blaming the Supreme Court I

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.390
think that we have to give pause when

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.010
those kinds of concerns are expressed to

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.129
also think about the fact that there

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.310
have been many a political campaign that

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.380
has been run indicating an intention to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.770
use the United States Supreme Court as a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.840
political tool to end things like the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.840
Affordable Care Act the Voting Rights

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.000
Act in campaign finance reform which

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.299
makes this conversation a legitimate one

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.479
in terms of a reasoned concern about

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.360
whether this nominee has been nominated

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.700
to fulfill a political agenda as it

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.930
relates to using that court and the use

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.000
of that court as it relates to the

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.970
42,000 documents or 42,000 pages of

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.100
documents I find it interesting that we

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.829
get those documents less than 24 hours

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.210
before this hearing is scheduled to

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.939
begin but it took 57 days for those

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.009
documents to be vetted before we would

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.689
even be given those documents so there's

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.710
some suggestion that we should be speed

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.320
readers and read 42 pages 42 thousand

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.700
pages of documents in about 15 hours

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.370
when it took the other side 57 days to

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.740
review those same documents so the logic

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.050
at least on the math is not applying

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.610
now the Chairman has requested 10% of

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:24.190
the nominees documents that's 10% of

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:28.090
100% of his full record the nominees

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:31.540
personal lawyer has only given us 7% of

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.630
his documents 7 out of 100 percent of

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.420
the full record Republicans have only

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.080
given 4% of these records are made in

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.050
public

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:48.640
that's 4% of 100% of a full record 96%

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:53.170
of his record is missing 96% of his

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:56.590
record is missing it is reasonable it is

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.440
reasonable that we should want to review

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.470
his entire record and then we can debate

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:07.180
among us the relevance of what is in his

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:10.330
record to his nomination but it should

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.930
not be the ability of this the

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.310
leadership of this committee to

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.620
unilaterally make decisions about we

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.600
what we will and will not see in terms

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.060
of its admissibility instead of arguing

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.610
about the weight of whatever is made

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.550
admissible the late Senator Kennedy of

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.830
Massachusetts call these hearings a

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.830
Supreme Court nominees quote job

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.200
interview with the American people and

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.930
by that standard the nominee before us

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.710
is coming in to his job interview with

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.020
more than 90% of his background hidden I

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.300
would think that anyone who wanted to

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.210
sit on the nation's highest court would

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.090
be proud of their record and would want

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:55.840
the American people to see it I would

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.060
think that anyone privileged to be

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.060
nominated to the Supreme Court of the

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.960
United States would want to be confirmed

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:09.460
in a process that is not under a cloud

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:12.670
that respects due process I would think

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:15.610
that anyone nominated to the Supreme

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.600
Court of the United States would want to

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:22.030
have a hearing that is characterized by

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:26.740
transparency and fairness and integrity

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:32.650
and not shrouded by uncertainty and

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:34.060
Bishan and concealment and doubt we

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.310
should not be moving forward with this

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.539
hearing the American people deserve

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:43.630
better than this so judge Cavanaugh as

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:45.639
most of us know and I will mention to

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.620
you and you have young children and and

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.150
and I and I know they're very proud of

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.009
you and I know you are a great parent

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.259
and and I applaud all that you have done

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.630
in the community and so as you know as

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:57.039
we all know this is a week when most

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.580
students in our country go back to

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:03.880
school and it occurs to me that many

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:07.720
years ago around around this time I was

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:11.319
starting kindergarten and I was a bus in

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.080
a bus a school bus on my way to Thousand

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:17.349
Oaks elementary school as part of the

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.319
second class of students as busing

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:23.530
desegregated Berkeley California public

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:25.509
schools this was decades after the

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.150
Supreme Court ruled brown v board of

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:32.259
education that separate was inherently

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:35.050
unequal and as I've said many times had

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:37.050
Chief Justice Earl Warren not been on

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.509
the Supreme Court of the United States

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.909
he could not have led a unanimous

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:46.659
decision and the outcome then of that

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:48.639
case may have been very different had

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:51.759
that decision not come down the way it

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:54.090
did I may not have had the opportunities

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:56.889
that allowed me to become a lawyer or

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.360
prosecutor I'd likely would not have

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.580
been elected District Attorney of San

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.370
Francisco or the Attorney General of

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.780
California and I most certainly would

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.620
not be sitting here as a member of the

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:11.500
United States Senate so for me a Supreme

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.840
Court seat is not only about academic

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:18.099
issues of legal precedent or judicial

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:20.770
philosophy it is personal when we talk

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:22.960
about our nation's highest court and the

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.210
men and women who sit on it we're

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:29.139
talking about the impact that one

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:31.270
individual on that court can have impact

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:34.300
on people you'll never meet and whose

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.250
names you will never know whether a

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.279
person can exercise their constitutional

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.550
right to cast a ballot that may be

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:43.039
decided

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.530
if judge Cavanaugh sits on that Court

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:46.669
whether a woman with breast cancer can

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.000
afford health care

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:52.970
or is forced off life-saving treatment

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.560
whether a gay or transgender worker is

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.750
treated with dignity

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.360
or maybe treated as a second-class

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:02.720
citizen whether a young woman who got

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:06.349
pregnant at 15 is forced to give birth

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:09.830
or in desperation go to a back-alley for

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:13.639
an abortion whether a president of the

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:16.180
United States can be held accountable or

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:20.330
whether he'll be above the law

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:23.060
all of this may come down to judge

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:26.449
Cavanaugh's vote and that's what's at

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:29.030
stake in this nomination and the stakes

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:31.039
are even higher because of the moment

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.849
we're in and many of us have discussed

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:37.159
this these are unprecedented times as

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:40.009
others have already observed less than

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:42.830
two weeks ago the president's personal

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:45.530
lawyer and campaign chairman were each

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:49.210
found guilty or pleaded guilty to eight

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:52.729
felonies the president's personal lawyer

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:57.009
under oath declared that the president

00:07:52.729 --> 00:08:01.190
directed him to commit a federal crime

00:07:57.009 --> 00:08:03.560
yet that same president is racing to a

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:06.409
point to a lifetime position on the

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:11.020
highest court in our land a court that

00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:14.029
very well may decide his legal fate and

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:16.849
yes that's essentially what confirming

00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:20.360
judge Kavanaugh could mean so it is

00:08:16.849 --> 00:08:22.930
important more important I say than ever

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:25.190
that the American people have

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:27.979
transparency and accountability with

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:30.650
this nomination and that's why it is

00:08:27.979 --> 00:08:33.349
extremely disturbing that Senate

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:36.860
Republicans have prevented this body and

00:08:33.349 --> 00:08:39.079
most important the American people from

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:42.320
fully reviewing judge Cavanaugh's record

00:08:39.079 --> 00:08:44.930
and have disregarded just about every

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.300
tradition and practice that I heard so

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:49.120
much about before I arrived in this

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.829
place

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.520
judge Cavanaugh when you and I met in my

00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:54.170
office

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.680
you said whether

00:08:54.170 --> 00:09:00.700
spec to judicial decisions that rushed

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:05.120
decisions are often bad decisions I

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:07.750
agree with you I agree with you and when

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:10.370
we are talking about who will sit on the

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:13.250
Supreme Court of the United States I

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:15.820
believe your point couldn't be more

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.820
important

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.899
mr. Czech mr. chairman when judge

00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:22.699
Kavanaugh was nominated in July he

00:09:20.899 --> 00:09:24.980
expressed his belief that a judge must

00:09:22.699 --> 00:09:28.639
be independent must interpret the law

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:30.380
and not make law but in reviewing this

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:32.660
nominees background I am deeply

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:34.519
concerned that what guides him is not

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:38.180
independence or impartiality

00:09:34.519 --> 00:09:41.420
it's not even ideology I would suggest

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:43.130
it is not even ideology what I believe

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.620
guides him and what his record that

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:49.430
we've been able to see shows is what

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:52.010
guides this nominee is partisanship this

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:55.220
nominee has devoted his entire career to

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:57.320
a conservative Republican agenda helping

00:09:55.220 --> 00:10:00.529
to spearhead a partisan investigation

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.810
into President Clinton helping george w

00:10:00.529 --> 00:10:07.160
bush's legal team ensure that every vote

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:09.470
was not counted in Bush v Gore helping

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.390
to confirm partisan judges and enact

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:15.079
partisan laws as part of the Bush White

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:18.140
House and in all of these efforts he has

00:10:15.079 --> 00:10:20.690
shown that he seeks to win at all cost

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:24.620
even if that means pushing the envelope

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:27.500
and if we look at his record on the DC

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:29.779
Circuit and in his recent writings and

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.820
statements it is clear that the nominee

00:10:29.779 --> 00:10:34.610
has brought his political bias to the

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:37.339
bench he has carried out deeply

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:39.140
conservative partisan agendas as part as

00:10:37.339 --> 00:10:42.260
a judge favoring big business over

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:44.510
ordinary Americans polluters over clean

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:47.540
air and water and the powerful over the

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:50.029
vulnerable just last year judge

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:52.510
Cavanaugh praised the dissent in roe v--

00:10:50.029 --> 00:10:54.920
wade and ruled against a scared

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:55.880
seventeen-year-old girl seeking to end

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.399
her pregnancy

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.680
he has disregarded the Supreme Court

00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:03.079
precedent to argue that undocumented

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:05.990
workers weren't really employees under

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:06.769
our labor laws we have witnessed

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.540
horrific

00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:11.749
mass shootings from parkland to Las

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:14.389
Vegas to Jacksonville Florida yet judge

00:11:11.749 --> 00:11:16.910
judge Kavanagh has gone further than the

00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:19.399
Supreme Court and has written that

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:22.939
because assault weapons are quote in

00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:25.459
common use assault weapons and

00:11:22.939 --> 00:11:28.309
high-capacity magazines cannot be banned

00:11:25.459 --> 00:11:29.660
under the Second Amendment when he was

00:11:28.309 --> 00:11:31.819
part of an Independent Counsel

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:34.629
investigation into the Democratic

00:11:31.819 --> 00:11:39.199
president the nominee was dogged in

00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:42.319
demanding answers and yet he has since

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:44.269
changed his tune arguing that presidents

00:11:42.319 --> 00:11:47.029
should not be investigated or held

00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:51.470
accountable a position that I am sure is

00:11:47.029 --> 00:11:53.689
not lost on this president these

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:57.049
positions are not impartial they are

00:11:53.689 --> 00:11:59.029
partisan judge Neal Gorsuch judge

00:11:57.049 --> 00:12:00.829
Cavanaugh's classmate insisted before

00:11:59.029 --> 00:12:03.049
this committee that judges are not

00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:06.199
merely quote politicians and robes

00:12:03.049 --> 00:12:08.720
I fear that judge Cavanaugh's record

00:12:06.199 --> 00:12:12.230
indicates that is exactly what he may

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:14.329
very well be now I know members of this

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:16.429
committee and the nominees friends and

00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:19.069
colleagues have assured us that he is

00:12:16.429 --> 00:12:21.199
devoted to his family and supportive of

00:12:19.069 --> 00:12:24.850
his law clerks and volunteers in his

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:27.230
community and I don't doubt that at all

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:32.179
but that's not why we are here

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:35.029
I rather that we think about this

00:12:32.179 --> 00:12:37.129
hearing in the context of the Supreme

00:12:35.029 --> 00:12:39.829
Court of the United States and the

00:12:37.129 --> 00:12:42.170
impact it will have on generations of

00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:47.059
Americans to come and do we want that

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:50.059
court to continue a legacy of being

00:12:47.059 --> 00:12:51.949
above politics and unbiased or are we

00:12:50.059 --> 00:12:54.860
prepared to participate in a process

00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:57.379
that is tainted and that leaves the

00:12:54.860 --> 00:13:02.360
American public questioning the

00:12:57.379 --> 00:13:04.579
integrity of this process and I'll close

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:06.529
by saying this we have a system of

00:13:04.579 --> 00:13:09.679
justice that is symbolized by a statue

00:13:06.529 --> 00:13:12.679
of a woman holding scales and she wears

00:13:09.679 --> 00:13:14.569
a blindfold justice wears a blindfold

00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:16.339
because we have said in the United

00:13:14.569 --> 00:13:19.519
States of America under our judicial

00:13:16.339 --> 00:13:20.570
system justice should be blind to a

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:23.030
person's status

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:26.060
we have said that in our system of

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:28.970
justice justice should be blind to how

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:31.940
much money someone has to what you look

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:35.150
like or who you love to who your parents

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:37.610
are in the language they speak and every

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:42.920
Supreme Court justice must understand

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:45.190
and uphold that ideal and sir should

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:48.470
those cases become become before you

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:50.630
judge Kavanagh I am concerned whether

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:54.230
you would treat every American equally

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:56.690
or instead show allegiance to the

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:59.000
political party and the conservative

00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:02.990
agenda that has shaped and built your

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.490
career what I am concerned your loyalty

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:07.640
would be to the president who appointed

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:11.060
you and not to the Constitution of the

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:12.500
United States these concerns I hope you

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:15.110
will answer during the course of this

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:17.710
hearing I believe the American people

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:20.390
have a right to have these concerns I

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:23.510
also believe the American public has a

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:25.010
right to full and candid answers to the

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:27.110
questions that are presented to you

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:29.180
during the course of this hearing I will

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:31.190
be playing of course very close

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:33.710
attention to your testimony and I think

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:35.480
you know the American public will be

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:38.450
paying very close attention to your

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:40.610
testimony thank you I'm really honored

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:42.410
to join that Lisa Blatt and Rob Portman

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:45.200
in introducing Brett Kavanaugh at these

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:47.720
hearings to consider his confirmation as

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:50.750
a Justice of the Supreme Court of the

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:52.760
United States of America my personal

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:56.330
relationship with judge Kavanaugh goes

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:58.550
back 17 years to our time as White House

00:14:56.330 --> 00:15:01.820
colleagues in the administration of

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:04.880
George W Bush those were remarkable

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:08.720
times and I loved serving they were

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:11.380
however not easy times and the guidance

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:15.830
and counsel of those with whom I worked

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:18.230
was both the joy and a blessing I am so

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:21.700
grateful to have had Brett Kavanaugh as

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:25.190
a colleague he was always supportive and

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:27.050
strong and caring and someone whose

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:30.170
integrity and good judgment I valued

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:31.730
enormous Lee I knew Brett early in his

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:34.460
years as a family member as a matter of

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:36.590
fact I was there when he married Ashley

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:39.110
I remember well the birth of his

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:42.410
children he is the great father and

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:45.350
husband and son in short he's just a

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:47.300
very good human being since the

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:48.950
nomination of Brett Kavanaugh I have

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.980
been able to reflect back on those times

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:55.640
and what my experience tells me about

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:57.680
Brett in this crucial role many have

00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.740
given testimony to his extraordinary

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:03.550
legal mind the depth of his experience

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:05.990
his intellect and his good common sense

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:08.270
you have heard and you will hear from

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:10.700
his clerks and other jurists and great

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:13.580
legal thinkers as well as colleagues

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:16.700
from throughout his career I do not need

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:19.010
to repeat their praise only the sight to

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:21.980
say that I know firsthand that bread is

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:25.330
really really smart here's the bread

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:29.120
Cavanaugh that I know he is hard-working

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:32.990
he has a sense of humor he seeks truth

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:35.900
in facts there is no detail too small to

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:40.190
gain his attention he makes those around

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:43.550
him better bread is wise he is an old

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:45.730
soul who is made to help steady us in

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:49.460
these complicated times

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:52.910
Brett listens especially to those with

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:56.330
whom he disagrees and in our charged

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:59.870
environment when we have become almost

00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:02.210
tribal living in echo chambers and often

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:05.030
finding comfort in the company of only

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:06.980
those with whom we agree this is an

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:09.370
indispensable quality for the

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:11.900
responsibilities of the Supreme Court

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:14.390
the only thing that would be better is

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:16.310
if Brett had gone to the same college

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:17.959
that his mentor and friend Anthony

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:20.270
Kennedy went to that would be Stanford

00:17:17.959 --> 00:17:22.130
University but for that I'll forgive him

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:25.070
and I have to say Yale University seems

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:28.010
to have done a pretty good job in recent

00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:30.890
weeks we've also had the chance to

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:34.250
reflect on our Constitution the Supreme

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:37.850
Court itself and the trust that we place

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:40.700
in the justices of it as a scholar and

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:43.160
as a diplomat I have watched the

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:46.550
struggle of people across the world to

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.929
achieve democracy and to keep it every

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:49.669
day

00:17:47.929 --> 00:17:52.190
I am more amazed by the brilliance of

00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:54.799
the institutional design that the

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:57.110
framers left to us they carefully

00:17:54.799 --> 00:17:59.259
balanced powers and responsibilities

00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:01.990
between the three branches of government

00:17:59.259 --> 00:18:04.970
knowing that human beings are fallible

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:07.669
they constructed institutions that both

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:12.110
enable and constrain those who would

00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:15.919
govern us scholars often speak of the

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:17.749
American spirit of constitutionalism we

00:18:15.919 --> 00:18:19.629
Americans believe that the Constitution

00:18:17.749 --> 00:18:23.509
is our personal protection

00:18:19.629 --> 00:18:25.340
we take our rights very seriously and we

00:18:23.509 --> 00:18:27.470
will go all the way to the Supreme Court

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:31.940
if we think those rights have been

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:34.639
violated a democracy is only stable when

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:37.369
there is that kind of trust in the

00:18:34.639 --> 00:18:40.179
institutions a belief that those

00:18:37.369 --> 00:18:43.669
institutions will be fair and just and

00:18:40.179 --> 00:18:46.549
secure the rights of citizens the

00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:49.759
strength of America's institutions is a

00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:53.119
cause for optimism but they cannot be

00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:55.369
taken for granted the Supreme Court's

00:18:53.119 --> 00:18:57.409
special role in protecting the careful

00:18:55.369 --> 00:18:59.899
balances that the Constitution seeks to

00:18:57.409 --> 00:19:04.070
achieve is crucial to our democratic

00:18:59.899 --> 00:19:07.070
stability this is true even as times and

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:09.019
customs change and it is more important

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:13.129
with every passing year in our

00:19:09.019 --> 00:19:15.049
increasingly complicated nation as a

00:19:13.129 --> 00:19:17.179
little girl born in segregated

00:19:15.049 --> 00:19:18.110
Birmingham Alabama who grew up to be

00:19:17.179 --> 00:19:22.070
Secretary of State

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:26.539
I know personally our country's long

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:29.659
journey to guarantee equal rights I know

00:19:26.539 --> 00:19:33.110
the power of the Constitution and I know

00:19:29.659 --> 00:19:37.279
the gift of our democracy the Supreme

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:41.149
Court is a crucial guardian both of our

00:19:37.279 --> 00:19:43.129
Constitution and of our democracy that

00:19:41.149 --> 00:19:46.220
is why I am so honored to introduce

00:19:43.129 --> 00:19:47.960
Brett Kavanaugh for these hearings he

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:51.139
will be an outstanding Supreme Court

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:55.129
