10 Star Wars Fan Theories That Will Change
The Way You See Everything

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.120
Every fandom has its theories, but Star Wars
fans are on another level.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.250
Armed with decades of discussion and a mountain
of detailed information and expanded-universe

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.320
stories, the Star Wars fan community tears
into every inconsistency, every seeming mistake,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.250
and every tiny thread that seems to be a bit
loose in pursuit of secret agendas, new angles,

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.699
and surprising explanations for seemingly
inexplicable behavior in the movies.

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.400
While most of them don't hold water, some
are so off-the-wall they just might work.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.234
Here are 10 Star Wars fan theories that will
change the way you see everything.

00:00:37.234 --> 00:00:42.280
The Phantom Menace - Maybe Jar-Jar wasn't
useless?

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.010
Almost nobody likes Jar-Jar Binks, the bizarre
CGI sidekick character from The Phantom Menace.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.340
Phantom has plenty of problems, but Jar-Jar
is its primary lightning rod for fan hatred.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.430
One thing people particularly despise is the
Gungan's uselessness.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.090
He doesn't do very much that couldn't have
been done better by somebody else... or does

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.090
he?

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.860
One of the weirdest fan theories about Jar-Jar
is that he's not a buffoon at all: he just

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.440
acts like one because he's actually an agent
for the evil Sith.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.830
There's a surprising amount of circumstantial
evidence to suggest that he's sensitive to

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.410
the Force: his combat moves seem Force-assisted,
and he waves his hands a lot when he talks

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.410
- the perfect camouflage for hiding a Jedi
mind trick.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.000
It sounds like a stretch at first, but the
more you think about it, the more plausible

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.280
it seems.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.250
A New Hope - Agent Robot and Agent Wookiee
Once a simple stand-alone story, A New Hope

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.310
has gotten more complicated over the years,
because it now fits into a much larger arc.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.410
Case in point: during Revenge of the Sith,
we see C-3PO lose all of his memories, which

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.200
explains why he can't tell Luke anything useful
19 years later, in A New Hope.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.550
R2-D2, however, undergoes no such memory wipe.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.870
Neither does Chewbacca, who was last seen
in Episode III, right in the thick of the

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:53.870
action.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.960
So why don't they warn Luke, or give him more
information about his father?

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.369
Simple, says one fan theory: Chewie and R2
are Rebel Alliance agents.

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.650
They can't tell Luke anything because they're
tasked with getting him off Tattooine and

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.720
into the fold of the Alliance, without arousing
any Imperial suspicion.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.670
They can't blab too much because it could
jeopardize their important mission.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.420
Revenge of the Sith - Vader can't express
himself

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:23.280
Everyone remembers the painfully melodramatic
NOOOOOOO that Anakin Skywalker - now reborn

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.790
as Darth Vader for the first time - yells
when he's told of Padme's death at the end

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.000
of Revenge of the Sith.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.700
It's one of the cheesiest moments in modern
film.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.700
Or is it?

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.480
One crazy fan theory holds that the silliness
of Vader's cry isn't a result of unfortunate

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.000
stage direction, but actually happens because
his new, computer-assisted voice can't adequately

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.700
process all the emotion he's trying to express.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.430
We know for a fact that Vader's bionic mask
changes his voice - he sounds very different

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.951
with the mask off, both as young Anakin and
in his final moments during Return of the

00:02:53.951 --> 00:02:54.951
Jedi.

00:02:54.951 --> 00:02:58.730
It's not a big leap to imagine that the software
that helps him speak might have trouble figuring

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.760
out how to parse an anguished cry.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.230
The scene is still unintentionally funny no
matter which way you cut it.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.350
But in light of this theory, it's a lot more
poignant, too.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.110
The Force Awakens - Finn is in tune with the
Force

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.910
Force users came from all races and backgrounds.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.110
Even Jabba the Hutt can resist the Jedi mind
trick.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.170
So why couldn't Finn, a former Trooper with
the First Order, be sensitive to it, too?

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.680
It's not hard to imagine a soldier awakening
to a new power after some life-jarring event.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.750
When Supreme Leader Snoke tells Kylo Ren that
there's been an awakening, we've only seen

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.170
one character do anything remarkable yet:
Finn, who's elected to leave the First Order

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.540
despite the considerable danger and difficulty
of doing so.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.010
Finn also seems to feel the destruction of
the Hosnian System from a great distance,

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.540
similar to the way Obi-Wan felt Alderaan being
destroyed in A New Hope.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.520
Only someone in tune with the Force is able
to do that.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.020
He might not be the next Jedi knight, but
Finn very well may have more power than anyone

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.020
expects.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.340
The Phantom Menace – Qui-Gon Jinn, secret
Sith master

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.660
Jedi knight Qui-Gon Jinn is killed off early
in Episode 1, and though we see him occasionally

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.130
in the following two movies, he never becomes
a major player after that.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.709
But was that by design?

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.209
One fan theory holds that Qui-Gon was actually
working with, or for, the Sith.

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.500
This theory is mostly based on his track record.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.710
It's no secret that Qui-Gon is not quite trusted
by the rest of the Jedi Council.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.340
He did, after all, train under Count Dooku,
who later went on to become Dark Lord of the

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.340
Sith.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.350
He insists on training Anakin, over Yoda's
objections, and leaves Obi-Wan Kenobi to finish

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.620
Anakin's training before Obi-Wan is ready.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.310
And according to Star Wars Legends, Qui-Gon
once had another student, Xanatos, who also

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.840
turned to the Dark Side.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.000
In short, Qui-Gon seems to wreck things for
the Jedi wherever he goes.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.870
It's not a stretch to think he had an active
interest in driving Anakin into the arms of

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:40.870
the Sith.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.990
A New Hope - Luke was hidden in plain sight
Remember how Luke Skywalker was hidden from

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.840
his father on the remote desert world of Tattooine?

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.940
And remember how Luke's father, Anakin Skywalker,
actually grew up for years on the same planet?

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.300
How does that make sense?

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.690
If you want to hide something from the enemy,
you don't put it in their childhood home - unless,

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.280
as this crazy fan theory suggests, that person
hates their childhood home to much they'd

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.250
never go back to it.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.169
Anakin lived on Tattooine as a slave.

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.930
He never liked the planet, and once expressed
to Padme that he never wanted to go back there

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:11.930
if he could help it.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.270
Worst of all, it's the place where his mother
was killed.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.000
The whole planet is filled with nothing but
despair, hopelessness, and anger for Darth

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Vader.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.580
It stands to reason, then, that it's the last
place he'd ever choose to go - even to look

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.110
for his long-lost son.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.110
E.T.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.750
The Extra-terrestrial – ET, also a secret
Sith master (?)

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.400
George Lucas and Steven Spielberg have been
friends for a long time, so it's no surprise

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.360
that they've both included nods to each others'
work in their films.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.699
The 1982 family classic E.T. the Extra-terrestrial
features a scene where E.T. appears to personally

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:46.730
recognize Yoda, in the form of a small child
who's dressed as the Jedi master for Halloween.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:51.419
Years later, in Star Wars Episode 1, a delegation
of aliens who seem to be of the same race

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.480
as E.T. can be seen in the Senate.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.169
Most people would chalk this up to a couple
of fun Easter eggs between old pals, but one

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.930
theory holds that the connection should be
taken seriously.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.860
E.T. seems to wield magical powers including
levitation and healing, almost all of which

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.320
can be explained by the use of the Force.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:13.010
And sure, he could be a Jedi, too, but Sith
Lord is more entertaining somehow – at least

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.010
as long as he doesn't Force choke anybody.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.120
A New Hope - Boba Fett killed Owen and Beru
Lars

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.900
This would seem like a stretch if not for
the Special Edition re-releases of the original

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.110
Star Wars trilogy.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.160
With the addition of their new and enhanced
scenes, Boba Fett now makes a brief appearance

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.570
on Tattooine around the same time that Luke
is making his way to Mos Eisley.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.020
We already know Fett will do the Empire's
dirty work for the right fee.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.010
Given his penchant for disintegrating people
- Darth Vader specifically warns him not to

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.470
disintegrate his Imperial bounties in Empire
- and the vaporized state of Luke's aunt and

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:47.110
uncle when he finds them, it's not inconceivable
that he was given the grim task of torching

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.710
the homestead in Luke's absence.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.100
Neither Sand people nor Stormtroopers are
known to vaporize bodies down to their bones.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.560
That leaves everybody's favorite bounty hunter
to do the deed... presumably to help finance

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.560
his 'Vette.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.900
Return of the Jedi - Ewoks suffer the Curse
of Kintave1

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.460
On one hand, Ewoks live in tree houses, have
funny voices, and look like stuffed animals

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.460
come to life.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.350
On the other hand, their resistance efforts
are lethally effective in foiling the Empire's

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.570
plans on Endor.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:14.580
Using logs, rocks, and wooden spears, the
Ewoks help bring the Imperial forces to their

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.580
knees.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.100
But before all that, we're introduced to the
Ewoks when they capture the heroes and prepare

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.130
to cook and eat them at a feast in honor of
their new god, C-3PO.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.930
As silly as this scene is, it implies that
eating humanoid flesh is not totally outside

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.610
the realm of normalcy for Ewoks.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.120
Of course, C-3PO and the crew manage to escape
their grisly fate, but looking at all the

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.229
empty Stormtrooper helmets in the Ewok village
at the end of the film, we suspect the Empire's

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:41.360
cloned soldiers weren't as lucky.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.650
We'll skip the meatloaf at that potluck, thanks.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:48.900
The Force Awakesn - Rey is Palpatine's granddaughter
Rey, the protagonist of The Force Awakens,

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.539
could be related to a number of important
people in the Star Wars universe.

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:56.800
Fan theories abound, but our new favorite,
suggested by culinary wizard and Star Wars

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.729
super-fan J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, is possibly
the most compelling: Rey is Emperor Palpatine's

00:08:02.729 --> 00:08:03.830
granddaughter.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.860
Think about it: the word "rey" means "king"
or "ruler" in Spanish, and the Star Wars series

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.300
has always been known for characters whose
names evoke the roles they play.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:16.330
She's also the only Star Wars character aside
from Palpatine to use a stabbing motion with

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:17.330
her lightsaber.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.410
Both Rey and Palpatine use the move multiple
times, but nobody else ever does.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:27.669
The list of evidence is surprisingly robust,
and it would make for a truly crazy twist.

00:08:27.669 --> 00:08:29.800
Which Star Wars theories are your favorites?

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.729
Do you know any even crazier fan theories
that start to make more sense the more you

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:34.729
think about them?

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:35.729
We'd love to hear about them!

00:08:35.729 --> 00:08:39.510
Give this video a thumbs-up and give us your
wildest ideas in the comments below.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.100
1 This is a Space Ghost Coast to Coast reference.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.100
“Kintave” is pronounced “kin-TAH-vee.”

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.100
I included it because nerds (like me) love
a cross-IP reference.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.100
However, if you think it's too obscure for
our viewers to get a kick out of it, please

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.100
feel free to change it to “Ewoks eat their
enemies.”
