00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:03.669
WELCOME, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
TO "THE LATE SHOW."

00:00:03.702 --> 00:00:05.271
I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT.

00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:07.106
THERE ARE SO MANY--
 ( APPLAUSE ).

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:12.178
( CHEERS )
THERE ARE SO MANY INVESTIGATIONS

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:14.047
SWIRLING AROUND DONALD TRUMP
RIGHT NOW THAT R. KELLY IS LIKE,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.915
"I'M GLAD I'M NOT THAT GUY."

00:00:15.948 --> 00:00:22.622
(  LAUGHTER  )
AND THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:25.625
THINK HE IS GUILTY OF SOMETHING.

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:29.095
ACCORDING TO A POLL THAT CAME
OUT YESTERDAY, 64% THOUGHT TRUMP

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:31.697
HAD COMMITTED CRIMES BEFORE HE
BECAME PRESIDENT, INCLUDING

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.100
33% OF REPUBLICANS.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:40.073
AND, YET, HIS APPROVAL RATING
WITH REPUBLICANS IS 82%.

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:43.142
"POLICE!

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:44.043
POLICE!

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:44.610
HE JUST STOLE MY WALLET!

00:00:44.643 --> 00:00:45.544
STOP THAT MAN!

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:49.482
I WANT TO VOTE FOR HIM!"
 (  LAUGHTER  )

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:55.955
BUT-- BUT--
 ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:00:55.988 --> 00:00:57.223
CHIN STROKER.

00:00:57.256 --> 00:00:59.425
BUT UNLIKE HIS CHEESEBURGERS,
TRUMP IS NOT TAKING THESE

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:02.662
INVESTIGATIONS LYING DOWN.

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:08.968
(  LAUGHTER  )
ACCORDING TO ONE OF HIS

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:12.738
BIOGRAPHERS, IN HIGH SCHOOL,
TRUMP LEARNED ONE THING ABOVE

00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:17.076
ALL ELSE: "LIFE IS ABOUT
SURVIVAL.

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:19.879
IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT SURVIVAL,"
REALLY?

00:01:19.912 --> 00:01:24.917
THAN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS
PICTURE?

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:25.885
THAT IS A CRY FOR HELP.

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:28.988
TRUMP IS FIGHTING BACK.

00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:31.624
HE IS STONEWALLING THE
CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION INTO

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:34.994
FIRST SON-IN-LAW AND MAN TRYING
TO COMMUNICATE TO HIS WIFE THAT

00:01:35.027 --> 00:01:37.563
HE'S READY TO LEAVE THE PARTY,
JARED KUSHNER.

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:43.636
(  LAUGHTER  )
YOU SEE, HERE'S THE DEAL:  JARED

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:46.405
KUSHNER'S SECURITY CLEARANCE WAS
REPEATEDLY OPPOSED BY THE

00:01:46.438 --> 00:01:48.941
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES.

00:01:48.974 --> 00:01:52.245
ONE OF THE REASONS IS THAT HE
LEFT SO MANY FOREIGN CONTACTS

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:56.983
AND FINANCIAL INTERESTS OFF
HIS ETHICS DISCLOSURE PAPERWORK

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:58.718
THAT HE HAD TO UPDATE IT AT
LEAST FORTY TIMES.

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:01.120
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY:
"IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED,

00:02:01.153 --> 00:02:02.321
REMIND THEM THAT YOU'RE
MARRIED TO THE PRESIDENT'S

00:02:02.354 --> 00:02:04.757
DAUGHTER."

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.693
(  LAUGHTER  )
SO JARED GOT IT ANYWAY, AFTER

00:02:07.726 --> 00:02:08.828
"TRUMP ORDERED OFFICIALS TO GIVE
JARED KUSHNER A SECURITY

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:11.564
CLEARANCE."

00:02:11.597 --> 00:02:18.738
ONE OF THE FEW TRUMP ORDERS THAT
DID NOT END WITH, "AND A SIDE OF

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:20.239
FRIES."

00:02:20.272 --> 00:02:22.675
SO, SO, SO--
 ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:02:22.708 --> 00:02:24.577
THANK YOU.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.917
SO, THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT
COMMITTEE, THE DEMOCRATS SAID,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.919
"HEY, HOW DID YOU COME TO THIS
DECISION?"

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:34.687
BUT YESTERDAY, THE WHITE HOUSE
TOLD DEMOCRATS THEY WON'T HAND

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.824
OVER THE KUSHNER SECURITY
DOCUMENTS.

00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:46.799
SO, NOW THE HAVE TO GET THEM
FROM RUSSIA.

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:48.634
AND WE KNOW THIS IS HOW IT WENT
DOWN, BECAUSE THEN-CHIEF OF

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:54.907
STAFF JOHN KELLY WROTE A
CONTEMPORANEOUS INTERNAL MEMO

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.242
ABOUT HOW HE HAD BEEN ORDERED TO
GIVE MR. KUSHNER THE TOP-SECRET

00:02:56.275 --> 00:02:57.376
CLEARANCE.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.047
IT'S ALL GOING INTO HIS WHITE
HOUSE TELL-ALL, "SIIIIGH."

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.950
AND JARED--
 (  LAUGHTER  )

00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:08.921
( APPLAUSE )
AND JARED'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:11.657
GOT A SECURITY CLEARANCE OUT OF
THE DISCOUNT BIN.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.228
SO DID FIRST DAUGHTER AND WOMAN
WATCHING ANOTHER BRUNCH PARTY

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:19.165
GET SEATED, EVEN THOUGH THEY
JUST GOT HERE, IVANKA TRUMP.

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:21.334
WOW.

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:24.237
SHE GOT A TOP-SECRET SECURITY
CLEARANCE!

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.405
ALL BARACK OBAMA'S DAUGHTERS GOT
WAS A PUPPY.

00:03:26.438 --> 00:03:29.675
BUT IT MAKES SENSE.

00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:35.181
BECAUSE IVANKA NEEDED CLASSIFIED
INTEL ON CHINA'S HUMAN RIGHTS

00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:37.850
ABUSES TO SEE IF IT IS POSSIBLE
TO PAY HER WORKERS ANY LESS.

00:03:37.883 --> 00:03:39.352
&gt;&gt; Audience: OOOOH.

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:41.988
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, NO!

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:45.524
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SOME OF THE
IVANKA'S WORKERS ARE HERE

00:03:45.557 --> 00:03:47.760
TONIGHT, EVIDENTLY.

00:03:47.793 --> 00:03:50.129
"TIGHTEN UP ON THOSE SEAMS.

00:03:50.162 --> 00:03:53.032
TIGHTEN UP ON THOSE SEAMS,
GIRLS."

00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:59.338
TRUMP MADE HIS STAFF PUSH FOR
IVANKA'S CLEARANCE INSTEAD OF

00:03:59.371 --> 00:04:04.310
HIM PUSHING FOR IT TO AVOID THE
APPEARANCE OF NEPOTISM.

00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:05.244
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:07.213
HERE'S ANOTHER WAY: DON'T HIRE
YOUR CHILDREN.

00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:09.782
AND THIS MORNING, TRUMP'S FORMER
LAWYER, MICHAEL COHEN, RETURNED

00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:11.284
TO CAPITOL HILL FOR PRIVATE
TESTIMONY TO THE HOUSE

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:14.854
INTELLIGENCE PANEL.

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:22.862
ONE THING THAT MIGHT HAVE COME
UP WERE THE CHECKS THAT TRUMP

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:28.100
WROTE TO REIMBURSE COHEN FOR
PAYING OFF STORMY DANIELS.

00:04:28.133 --> 00:04:29.268
IT'S AN ACCOUNTING METHOD KNOWN
IN THE PAYROLL INDUSTRY AS

00:04:29.301 --> 00:04:32.338
"A CRIME."

00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:33.572
TECHNICALLY.

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:34.373
WELL, "THE NEW YORK TIMES" GOT
THEIR HANDS ON A BUNCH OF THOSE

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:36.208
CHECKS, AND THE DATES ARE
REVEALING.

00:04:36.241 --> 00:04:38.678
IT TURNS OUT, TRUMP WOULD BE
DOING PRESIDENT STUFF, THEN IN

00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:40.946
IN THE MIDDLE OF DOING THE
PRESIDENT STUFF, HE WOULD STEP

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.249
OVER HERE AND CUT A CHECK TO
CHOEN.

00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:46.952
WHICH "THE TIMES" DESCRIBES AS
"THE PARALLEL LIVES TRUMP WAS

00:04:46.985 --> 00:04:47.787
LIVING."

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:54.126
I BELIEVE HE HAS PARALLEL LIVES.

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:56.062
WE'RE EVENTUALLY GOING TO FIND
OUT ABOUT HIS SECRET FAMILY HE

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:58.531
HAS STASHED IN THE ATTIC OF
TRUMP TOWER.

00:04:58.564 --> 00:05:00.499
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE ERIC AND
DON JUNIOR, WAIT TILL YOU MEET

00:05:00.532 --> 00:05:03.669
DERRICK AND RON JEENIOR.

00:05:03.702 --> 00:05:04.370
(  LAUGHTER  )
 ( APPLAUSE )

00:05:04.403 --> 00:05:06.706
THAT IS REALLY FRIGHTENING.

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:07.640
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH!

00:05:07.673 --> 00:05:09.308
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT IS
DISTURBING.

00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:11.410
&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT IS PRETTY WILD!

00:05:11.443 --> 00:05:18.250
(  LAUGHTER  )
 (  LAUGHTER  )

00:05:18.283 --> 00:05:23.589
( APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF

00:05:23.622 --> 00:05:25.091
THIS DOUBLE LIFE.

00:05:25.124 --> 00:05:28.761
ONE CHECK, FROM EARLY 2017, WAS
SIGNED THE SAME DAY TRUMP PULLED

00:05:28.794 --> 00:05:34.367
ASIDE JAMES COMEY AND SUGGESTED
"LETTING FLYNN GO."

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.000
"LISTEN, JAMES, LET THIS ONE GO.

00:05:35.033 --> 00:05:37.770
JUST BE PATIENT.

00:05:37.803 --> 00:05:42.074
I SWEAR, I'VE GOT MUCH BETTER
CRIMES COMING UP."

00:05:42.107 --> 00:05:45.544
(  LAUGHTER  )
BY THE WAY, THE EXACT DATE OF

00:05:45.577 --> 00:05:48.381
THAT CHECK WAS FEBRUARY 14th.

00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:49.148
VALENTINE'S DAY.

00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:50.049
ISN'T THAT SWEET?

00:05:50.082 --> 00:05:52.385
THAT'S KIND OF NICE, YOU KNOW.

00:05:52.418 --> 00:05:58.791
"HONEY, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH THAT
I JUST CUT A CHECK SO YOU'LL

00:05:58.824 --> 00:06:01.327
NEVER FIND OUT HOW MUCH I GET
LOVE-- (BLEEP).

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.428
YOU GET THE IDEA.

00:06:02.461 --> 00:06:12.505
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU GET THE IDEA!

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:17.476
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU GET THE IDEA!

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:18.444
JUST--
"SO YOU'LL NEVER FIND OUT HOW

00:06:18.477 --> 00:06:20.679
MUCH I LOVE GETTING SPANKED BY
SOMEBODY ELSE."

00:06:20.712 --> 00:06:23.416
AND-- AND-- TRAUMATIC
REENACTMENT.

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:28.587
(  LAUGHTER  )
AND THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.994
ACTUAL CHECK ON NOVEMBER 21,
2017, THE DAY WHEN TRUMP PARDON

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:37.129
AID TURKEY.

00:06:37.162 --> 00:06:39.064
AND YOU CAN TELL STORMY WAS ON
HIS MIND THAT DAY, BECAUSE IF

00:06:39.097 --> 00:06:40.733
YOU WATCH, HE SURE SEEMED TO BE
RELIVING SOME OF HIS BEST

00:06:40.766 --> 00:06:41.367
MOMENTS WITH HER.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.901
&gt;&gt; AM I ALLOWED TO TOUCH IT?

00:06:41.934 --> 00:06:43.969
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.

00:06:44.002 --> 00:06:46.405
&gt;&gt; WOW.

00:06:46.438 --> 00:06:49.542
I FEEL SO GOOD ABOUT MYSELF
DOING IT.

00:06:49.575 --> 00:07:01.320
(  LAUGHTER  )
 ( APPLAUSE )

00:07:01.353 --> 00:07:02.755
&gt;&gt; Stephen: RIGHT AFTER THAT,
THE TURKEY HIRED MICHAEL

00:07:02.788 --> 00:07:05.725
AVENATTI.
