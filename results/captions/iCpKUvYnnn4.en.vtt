WHAT SEEMED LIKE A SMOOTH PATH

00:00:16.473 --> 00:00:19.208

00:01:26.976 --> 00:01:33.348
IT SAID ANTHRAX HA, HA, HA.

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:34.783
IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME.

00:01:34.784 --> 00:01:36.785
MY HUSBAND AND OUR DOG, PARTS OF

00:01:36.786 --> 00:01:38.687

HAZMAT TEAMS BROUGHT IN.

00:01:39.956 --> 00:01:42.758
WHAT WAS EVEN WORSE WAS WHAT WAS

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.993
DONE TO MY STAFF.

00:01:44.994 --> 00:01:49.531
THEY HAD TO BE SUBJECTED TO ALL

00:01:49.532 --> 00:01:50.866
SORTS OF ABUSE.

00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:54.770
A 25-YEAR-OLD CASEWORKER ON MY

00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:56.371
STAFF WHO DEALS WITH SOCIAL

I LOST ABOUT STAFFER, SHE JUST

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.592
COULD NOT TAKE THE TREMENDOUS

00:02:16.593 --> 00:02:18.160
ABUSE THAT WAS HEAPED UPON THEM.

00:02:18.161 --> 00:02:19.628
&gt;&gt; Martha: I LISTEN TO SOME OF

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.964
THE PHONE CALL MESSAGE IS THAT

00:02:21.965 --> 00:02:22.397
RECEIVED.

00:02:22.398 --> 00:02:23.999
WE ARE JUST GOING TO PLAY A BIT

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.267
OF ONE OF THEM SO PEOPLE CAN GET

00:02:25.268 --> 00:02:27.336
A SENSE OF JUST HOW BRUTAL THE

00:02:27.337 --> 00:02:29.338
TREATMENT OF THE WISE, AND IT

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:31.073
WILL BE [BLEEP] OUT.

00:02:31.074 --> 00:02:32.107
HERE'S PART OF IT.

00:02:32.108 --> 00:02:33.342
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE SO [BLEEP]ING NAIVE.

00:02:33.343 --> 00:02:34.176
YOU WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS

00:02:34.177 --> 00:02:39.314
THE MOST NAIVE PERSON EVER TO

00:02:39.315 --> 00:02:41.383
BE IN CONGRESS.

00:02:41.384 --> 00:02:43.018
&gt;&gt; Martha: IT IS UNBELIEVABLE,

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.154
THE RAGE IN THESE PEOPLE'S

00:02:45.155 --> 00:02:46.355
VOICES.

00:02:46.356 --> 00:02:48.590
&gt;&gt; IT WAS UNLIKE ANYTHING I HAVE

00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:50.292
SEEN IN ALL THE YEARS I HAVE

00:02:50.293 --> 00:02:52.194
BEEN PRIVILEGED TO SERVE IN THE

00:02:52.195 --> 00:02:52.995
SENATE.

00:02:52.996 --> 00:02:54.696
THERE WAS ONE NIGHT I WAS

00:02:54.697 --> 00:02:55.330
WORKING VERY LATE ON THE

00:02:55.331 --> 00:02:58.901
CAVANAGH NOMINATION, I DROVE

00:02:58.902 --> 00:03:00.769
MYSELF HOME AT 9:30 AT NIGHT,

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.271
COULDN'T FIND A PARKING SPACE,

00:03:02.272 --> 00:03:04.573
HAD TO PARK A BLOCK AWAY, AND

00:03:04.574 --> 00:03:05.607
THERE WAS A MAN WHO HAD BEEN

00:03:05.608 --> 00:03:07.709
WAITING THERE FOR ME IN THE

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.578
POURING RAIN AND DARK.

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:10.846
I LOOK AROUND THE STREETS, THERE

00:03:10.847 --> 00:03:14.116
IS NOBODY ELSE OUT, AND HE

00:03:14.117 --> 00:03:16.385
FOLLOWS ME TO MY HOUSE, STARTS

00:03:16.386 --> 00:03:17.586
SCREAMING AT ME, SHINES A

00:03:17.587 --> 00:03:20.122
FLASHLIGHT IN MY EYES.

00:03:20.123 --> 00:03:25.727
TURNS ON A CAMCORDER, AND IT WAS

00:03:25.728 --> 00:03:26.762
FRIGHTENING.

00:03:26.763 --> 00:03:27.563
THE ONLY FUNNY THING ABOUT IT,

00:03:27.564 --> 00:03:31.366
WHEN I FINALLY WAS FRANTICALLY

00:03:31.367 --> 00:03:33.101
TRYING TO UNLOCK MY DOOR, AND I

00:03:33.102 --> 00:03:38.173
TURNED TO HIM AND SAID "YOU STOP

00:03:38.174 --> 00:03:38.907
HARASSING ME," AND HE GAVE ME

00:03:38.908 --> 00:03:40.976
HIS NAME.

00:03:40.977 --> 00:03:44.780
&gt;&gt; Martha: THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

00:03:44.781 --> 00:03:45.480
DID THEY FOLLOW UP?

00:03:45.481 --> 00:03:47.783
&gt;&gt; THEY DID.

00:03:47.784 --> 00:03:48.617
WHAT I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND IS

00:03:48.618 --> 00:03:50.886
WHY ANYONE WOULD THINK THAT I

00:03:50.887 --> 00:03:54.957
WOULD BE INTIMIDATED BY THOSE

00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:55.357
TACTICS.

00:03:55.358 --> 00:03:57.292
AND THAT THEY WOULD BE

00:03:57.293 --> 00:04:00.929
SUCCESSFUL IN CONVERTING ME OR

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.601
CAUSING ME TO VOTE AGAINST JUDGE

00:04:05.602 --> 00:04:09.104
KAVANAUGH, SIMPLY BECAUSE I WAS

00:04:09.105 --> 00:04:11.573
THREATENED.

00:04:11.574 --> 00:04:12.608
&gt;&gt; Martha: THE FIERCELY

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:13.542
CONTENTIOUS CONFIRMATION PROCESS

00:04:13.543 --> 00:04:14.376
FOR JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH COME I

00:04:14.377 --> 00:04:15.310
WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK AND GET

00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:17.179
YOUR REACTION.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.047
&gt;&gt; THE WHOLE STAGE FOR THIS VERY

00:04:19.048 --> 00:04:20.215
DYSFUNCTIONAL CIRCUS THAT

00:04:20.216 --> 00:04:23.218
OCCURRED IN THIS NOMINATION WAS

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:25.153
THAT WHEN CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY

00:04:25.154 --> 00:04:27.155
TRIED TO GIVE AN OPENING

00:04:27.156 --> 00:04:27.522
STATEMENT.

00:04:27.523 --> 00:04:29.958
&gt;&gt; AN EXCITING DAY FOR ALL OF

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:32.761
YOU HERE, AND YOU ARE RIGHTLY

00:04:32.762 --> 00:04:33.362
PROUD --

00:04:33.363 --> 00:04:34.863
&gt;&gt; MR. CHAIRMAN, IF WE CANNOT BE

00:04:34.864 --> 00:04:40.168
RECOGNIZED, I MOVED TO ADJOURN.

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.137
&gt;&gt; AND HE WAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED

00:04:42.138 --> 00:04:44.273
TO FINISH HIS OPENING STATEMENT

00:04:44.274 --> 00:04:45.941
BEFORE HE WAS INTERRUPTED, AND

00:04:45.942 --> 00:04:50.579
WHAT WAS CLEARLY AN ORCHESTRATED

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.781
MOVE BY SOME OF THE DEMOCRATIC

00:04:52.782 --> 00:04:53.148
SENATORS.

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:54.983
&gt;&gt; WE ARE RUSHING THROUGH THIS

00:04:54.984 --> 00:04:57.185
PROCESS IN A WAY THAT IS

00:04:57.186 --> 00:04:57.619
UNNECESSARY.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.354
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT IS A DISSERVICE TO

00:04:59.355 --> 00:05:01.356
THE UNITED STATES SENATE.

00:05:01.357 --> 00:05:02.090
WE ARE BETTER THAN THAT, AND

00:05:02.091 --> 00:05:06.261
THIS IS NOT WHAT THE

00:05:06.262 --> 00:05:07.963
CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS OF ADVISE

00:05:07.964 --> 00:05:09.665
AND CONSENT IS SUPPOSED TO BE

00:05:09.666 --> 00:05:09.965
ABOUT.

00:05:09.966 --> 00:05:12.968
I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT THIS

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:15.270
REPRESENTS A ROCK-BOTTOM AND

00:05:15.271 --> 00:05:18.006
WHAT HAS BEEN A STEADY DECLINE

00:05:18.007 --> 00:05:21.777
IN THE DIGNITY AND DECORUM OF

00:05:21.778 --> 00:05:22.511
THE NOMINATION PROCESS FOR THE

00:05:22.512 --> 00:05:27.182
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES OVER THE

00:05:27.183 --> 00:05:28.550
PAST THREE DECADES.

00:05:28.551 --> 00:05:30.652
&gt;&gt; I WAS PUSHED ONTO THE BED,

00:05:30.653 --> 00:05:32.087
AND BRETT ON TOP OF ME.

00:05:32.088 --> 00:05:36.558
I BELIEVE HE WAS GOING TO RAPE

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:36.825
ME.

00:05:36.826 --> 00:05:38.360
&gt;&gt; Martha: SPOKEN WITH BRETT

00:05:38.361 --> 00:05:38.961
KAVANAUGH FOR HOURS AND

00:05:38.962 --> 00:05:41.363
RESEARCHED HIS BACKGROUND, WHAT

00:05:41.364 --> 00:05:42.130
WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN YOU

00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:42.798
SAW THAT.

00:05:42.799 --> 00:05:44.967
&gt;&gt; IT WAS PAINFUL, IT WAS

00:05:44.968 --> 00:05:45.701
HEART-WRENCHING, I BELIEVED HER

00:05:45.702 --> 00:05:49.404
WHEN SHE SAID SHE WAS TERRIFIED.

00:05:49.405 --> 00:05:50.105
BUT SHE MENTIONED FOUR PEOPLE

00:05:50.106 --> 00:05:53.542
WHO WERE THERE THAT NIGHT, AND I

00:05:53.543 --> 00:05:56.645
FELT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT THAT

00:05:56.646 --> 00:05:58.714
WE REOPEN THE FBI INVESTIGATION

00:05:58.715 --> 00:06:01.383
TO HEAR WHAT THEY SAID.

00:06:01.384 --> 00:06:03.018
&gt;&gt; I'VE NEVER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:06.054
ANYONE, NOT IN HIGH SCHOOL, NOT

00:06:06.055 --> 00:06:08.323
IN COLLEGE, NOT EVER.

00:06:08.324 --> 00:06:10.325
&gt;&gt; Martha: WHEN I HEARD BRETT

00:06:10.326 --> 00:06:15.497
KAVANAUGH'S REJOINDER TO IT, I

00:06:15.498 --> 00:06:17.899
HEARD A MAN WITH GREAT ANGUISH

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.602
AND ANGER WHO FELT FALSELY

00:06:20.603 --> 00:06:24.139
ACCUSED, SO I FELT THAT DR. FORD

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:29.444
CERTAINLY HAD ENDURED A SEXUALLY

00:06:29.445 --> 00:06:32.180
TRAUMA, OR SOME TYPE OF INCIDENT

00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:34.649
THAT UPENDED HER LIFE, BUT I DID

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.054
NOT FIND THE EVIDENCE, ANY

00:06:39.055 --> 00:06:40.455
CORROBORATION, IN FACT, THAT

00:06:40.456 --> 00:06:41.857
BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS THE PERSON

00:06:41.858 --> 00:06:43.959
WHO ASSAULTED HER.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.327
&gt;&gt; Martha: SOME OF YOUR

00:06:45.328 --> 00:06:45.961
COLLEAGUES SAID WHEN THEY

00:06:45.962 --> 00:06:47.596
WATCHED HIS REACTION, THEY FELT

00:06:47.597 --> 00:06:51.833
THAT HIS TEMPERAMENT WAS NOT

00:06:51.834 --> 00:06:54.169
APPROPRIATE FOR A SUPREME COURT

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.171
JUSTICE, AND THEY REFERRED IT TO

00:06:56.172 --> 00:06:56.671
MOMENTS LIKE THIS.

00:06:56.672 --> 00:06:57.806
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE SAYING THERE HAS

00:06:57.807 --> 00:06:58.740
NEVER BEEN A CASE WHERE YOU

00:06:58.741 --> 00:07:00.609
DRANK SO MUCH THAT YOU DIDN'T

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:01.343
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED THE NIGHT

00:07:01.344 --> 00:07:03.979
BEFORE OR PART OF WHAT HAPPENED?

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.480
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE ASKING ABOUT

00:07:05.481 --> 00:07:08.216
BLACKOUTS -- I DON'T KNOW, HAVE

00:07:08.217 --> 00:07:08.550
YOU?

00:07:08.551 --> 00:07:11.086
&gt;&gt; COULD YOU ANSWER THE

00:07:11.087 --> 00:07:12.587
QUESTION, JUDGE?

00:07:12.588 --> 00:07:14.589
THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED, IS THAT

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:14.990
YOU ANSWER?

00:07:14.991 --> 00:07:17.559
&gt;&gt; YES, AND I'M CURIOUS IF YOU

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:17.859
HAVE.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.162
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO DRINKING PROBLEMS,

00:07:20.163 --> 00:07:20.462
JUDGE.

00:07:20.463 --> 00:07:21.963
&gt;&gt; NOR DO I.

00:07:21.964 --> 00:07:22.964
&gt;&gt; Martha: DID YOU EVER FIND

00:07:22.965 --> 00:07:24.599
HIS RESPONSE IS TO BE

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.934
INAPPROPRIATE IN THAT HEARING?

00:07:25.935 --> 00:07:27.836
&gt;&gt; THAT WASN'T APPROPRIATE.

00:07:27.837 --> 00:07:28.703
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT IT

00:07:28.704 --> 00:07:31.273
WASN'T JUST DR. FORD'S

00:07:31.274 --> 00:07:35.343
ACCUSATION, BUT THESE OUTLANDISH

00:07:35.344 --> 00:07:39.414
ACCUSATIONS BROUGHT BY MICAH MIC

00:07:39.415 --> 00:07:39.448
ACCUSATIONS BROUGHT BY MICAH MIA

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:39.948
ACCUSATIONS BROUGHT BY MICAH MIL

00:07:39.949 --> 00:07:40.949
AVENATTI AND JULIE SWETNICK,

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:41.850
THAT ACCUSED HIM OF DRUGGING

00:07:41.851 --> 00:07:43.985
GIRLS, TEENAGE GIRLS, SO THAT HE

00:07:43.986 --> 00:07:48.557
COULD PARTICIPATE IN GANG RAPE,

00:07:48.558 --> 00:07:51.259
SO I THINK THE ANGER AND ANGST

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.762
OF THAT HE FELT, AND ANGUISH

00:07:53.763 --> 00:07:57.165
ABOUT THAT, MADE HIM LESS

00:07:57.166 --> 00:07:59.067
TEMPERATE THAN HE SHOULD HAVE

00:07:59.068 --> 00:08:00.168
BEEN IN THAT RESPONSE.

00:08:00.169 --> 00:08:02.170
&gt;&gt; Martha: WHAT WAS THAT

00:08:02.171 --> 00:08:02.871
LIGHT, YOU AND LISA MURKOWSKI

00:08:02.872 --> 00:08:04.473
FALL INTO THAT BASKET OF

00:08:04.474 --> 00:08:05.240
MODERATE REPUBLICANS THAT

00:08:05.241 --> 00:08:07.109
EVERYONE LOOKS TO WHEN THESE

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.243
THINGS HAPPEN.

00:08:08.244 --> 00:08:08.977
SHE DECIDED THAT SHE COULD NOT

00:08:08.978 --> 00:08:10.946
BE A "YES" ."

00:08:10.947 --> 00:08:12.614
&gt;&gt; WE ARE VERY GOOD FRIENDS.

00:08:12.615 --> 00:08:14.449
I HAD TALKED TO HER THE MORNING

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:18.887
OF THE VOTE, THE FIRST VOTE TO

00:08:18.888 --> 00:08:20.322
INVOKE CLOSURE, AND SHE WAS

00:08:20.323 --> 00:08:22.190
STILL UNDECIDED.

00:08:22.191 --> 00:08:23.758
WE SIT TOGETHER ON THE SENATE

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:25.227
FLOOR, AND SHE CAME ONTO THE

00:08:25.228 --> 00:08:27.229
FLOOR AND SAT DOWN, AND SHE

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:31.933
TURNED TO ME, AND I THOUGHT SHE

00:08:31.934 --> 00:08:35.370
SAID "I DECIDED I CAN VOTE FOR

00:08:35.371 --> 00:08:35.670
HIM."

00:08:35.671 --> 00:08:38.940
I MISHEARD HER.

00:08:38.941 --> 00:08:40.642
SO I SMILED WIDELY, AND I SAID,

00:08:40.643 --> 00:08:41.910
I'M SO RELIEVED THAT WE CAME TO

00:08:41.911 --> 00:08:44.579
THE RIGHT CONCLUSION.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.115
THAT WE CAME TO THE SAME

00:08:47.116 --> 00:08:47.549
CONCLUSION.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:50.118
AND SHE SAID, YOU MISHEARD ME.

00:08:50.119 --> 00:08:52.587
I SAID I CANNOT VOTE FOR HIM.

00:08:52.588 --> 00:08:57.125
I'M SURE MY FACE FELL, BUT IT

00:08:57.126 --> 00:09:00.662
HAS NOT IN ANY WAY AFFECTED OUR

00:09:00.663 --> 00:09:02.898
DEEP FRIENDSHIP, AND I RESPECT

00:09:02.899 --> 00:09:03.598
HER OPINION, EVEN THOUGH I

00:09:03.599 --> 00:09:05.967
REACHED A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION.

00:09:05.968 --> 00:09:09.070
&gt;&gt; THE POLITICALLY CHARGED

00:09:09.071 --> 00:09:11.473
ATMOSPHERE SURROUNDING THIS

00:09:11.474 --> 00:09:14.676
NOMINATION HAS REACHED A FEVER

00:09:14.677 --> 00:09:15.177
PITCH.

00:09:15.178 --> 00:09:16.178
&gt;&gt; Martha: YOU PUT A LOT OF

00:09:16.179 --> 00:09:17.946
TIME AND THOUGHT INTO THE SPEECH

00:09:17.947 --> 00:09:19.614
YOU GAVE, AND IT GOT PRETTY MUCH

00:09:19.615 --> 00:09:21.383
EVERYBODY STOPPED IN THE COUNTRY

00:09:21.384 --> 00:09:22.784
TO WATCH, AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW

00:09:22.785 --> 00:09:25.353
WHAT YOUR FINAL DECISION WAS AND

00:09:25.354 --> 00:09:27.255
HOW YOU HAD DECIDED TO VOTE.

00:09:27.256 --> 00:09:30.325
&gt;&gt; WE MUST ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT

00:09:30.326 --> 00:09:34.262
IT IS WHEN PASSIONS ARE MOST

00:09:34.263 --> 00:09:37.599
INFLAMED THAT FAIRNESS IS MOST

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.935
IN JEOPARDY.

00:09:39.936 --> 00:09:41.203
&gt;&gt; Martha: THAT LINE GOT A LOT

00:09:41.204 --> 00:09:41.636
OF ATTENTION.

00:09:41.637 --> 00:09:45.907
&gt;&gt; I FELT SO STRONGLY THAT WE

00:09:45.908 --> 00:09:47.108
WERE REALLY AT A CRITICAL POINT

00:09:47.109 --> 00:09:51.646
FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND IF WE, THE

00:09:51.647 --> 00:09:52.347
SENATE CONFIRMATION PROCESS IS

00:09:52.348 --> 00:09:55.684
NOT A TRIAL, BUT THERE ARE

00:09:55.685 --> 00:09:57.252
CERTAIN STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE

00:09:57.253 --> 00:10:00.555
TO ABIDE BY.

00:10:00.556 --> 00:10:02.857
IF WE WERE GOING TO THROW

00:10:02.858 --> 00:10:07.128
OVERBOARD THE PRESUMPTION OF

00:10:07.129 --> 00:10:07.862
INNOCENCE DESPITE THE COMPLETE

00:10:07.863 --> 00:10:11.066
LACK OF CORROBORATING EVIDENCE,

00:10:11.067 --> 00:10:14.636
EVEN FROM DR. FORD'S BEST

00:10:14.637 --> 00:10:18.540
FRIEND, AND IF WE WERE GOING TO

00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:20.342
DISPENSE WITH FAIRNESS, THE RULE

00:10:20.343 --> 00:10:23.044
OF LAW, AND DUE PROCESS, I

00:10:23.045 --> 00:10:23.678
REALLY FEARED FOR WHAT OUR

00:10:23.679 --> 00:10:27.549
COUNTRY WOULD BECOME, AND

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:28.316
WHETHER ANYONE WOULD BE WILLING

00:10:28.317 --> 00:10:32.554
TO PUT THEIR NAME FORTH FOR

00:10:32.555 --> 00:10:33.655
PUBLIC SERVICE.

00:10:33.656 --> 00:10:35.090
WHO WOULD GO THROUGH THAT?

00:10:35.091 --> 00:10:36.958
&gt;&gt; Martha: HAVE YOU SPOKEN

00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:39.227
WITH HIM SINCE YOU GAVE YOUR

00:10:39.228 --> 00:10:39.661
FAMOUS SPEECH?

00:10:39.662 --> 00:10:41.129
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NOT.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:41.863
I GOT ONE TEXT MESSAGE FROM HIM

00:10:41.864 --> 00:10:43.765
RIGHT AFTER IT IN WHICH HE SAID

00:10:43.766 --> 00:10:46.668
THAT HE WOULD WORK HARD TO MAKE

00:10:46.669 --> 00:10:48.970
ME PROUD, AND THE AMERICAN

00:10:48.971 --> 00:10:49.404
PEOPLE PROUD.

00:10:49.405 --> 00:10:51.606
&gt;&gt; Martha: DO YOU THINK IT IS

00:10:51.607 --> 00:10:52.741
ROCK-BOTTOM?

00:10:52.742 --> 00:10:53.608
AS CLAIRE McCASKILL SAID, AND

00:10:53.609 --> 00:10:55.343
I THINK SHE WAS SENDING A

00:10:55.344 --> 00:10:57.412
MESSAGE, PERHAPS, TO FELLOW

00:10:57.413 --> 00:10:58.380
DEMOCRATS, THAT THIS ISN'T

00:10:58.381 --> 00:11:01.149
GETTING US ANYWHERE, FOLKS.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.485
&gt;&gt; I WAS SO GLAD WHEN CLAIRE

00:11:03.486 --> 00:11:06.554
SPOKE UP, BECAUSE I THINK IT

00:11:06.555 --> 00:11:06.921
HURT HER.

00:11:06.922 --> 00:11:10.558
I THINK IT HURT JOE DONNELLY AND

00:11:10.559 --> 00:11:11.259
HEIDI HEITKAMP, WHO ALSO LOST

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.328
THEIR SEATS.

00:11:13.329 --> 00:11:16.131
NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR VOTES SO

00:11:16.132 --> 00:11:17.966
MUCH, BUT BECAUSE OF THE

00:11:17.967 --> 00:11:21.069
SPECTACLE AND THE UNFAIR

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.038
TREATMENT OF BOTH JUDGE

00:11:23.039 --> 00:11:26.474
KAVANAUGH AND CHRISTINE FORD,

00:11:26.475 --> 00:11:28.843
WHO ASKED SPECIFICALLY THAT HER

00:11:28.844 --> 00:11:31.212
ALLEGATIONS BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL

00:11:31.213 --> 00:11:34.949
AND BE HANDLED IN A CLOSED

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:35.283
SESSION.

00:11:35.284 --> 00:11:36.551
&gt;&gt; Martha: YOU WANT TO

00:11:36.552 --> 00:11:38.053
ST. LAWRENCE UNIVERSITY, AS DID

00:11:38.054 --> 00:11:38.286
I.

00:11:38.287 --> 00:11:41.890
A LETTER WAS CIRCULATED, 1500,

00:11:41.891 --> 00:11:44.726
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, THE FESTERS

00:11:44.727 --> 00:11:45.894
AND ALUMNI, WROTE A SCATHING

00:11:45.895 --> 00:11:46.728
LETTER SAYING THEY WANTED TO

00:11:46.729 --> 00:11:50.498
RESCIND THE TWO HONORARY DEGREES

00:11:50.499 --> 00:11:52.334
THEY HAD GIVEN YOU AT YOUR

00:11:52.335 --> 00:11:52.734
UNIVERSITY.

00:11:52.735 --> 00:11:55.036
IN THE PAST HAD HERALDED YOU FOR

00:11:55.037 --> 00:11:56.938
YOUR BIPARTISAN DECISIONS.

00:11:56.939 --> 00:11:59.507
&gt;&gt; IT WAS A VERY PAINFUL

00:11:59.508 --> 00:12:00.508
EXPERIENCE, BECAUSE I LOVED MY

00:12:00.509 --> 00:12:03.378
TIME AT ST. LAWRENCE.

00:12:03.379 --> 00:12:05.980
WHEN I WAS AT ST. LAWRENCE, FREE

00:12:05.981 --> 00:12:06.748
AND OPEN DEBATE WAS ENCOURAGED,

00:12:06.749 --> 00:12:09.451
DIVERSE VIEWPOINTS WERE

00:12:09.452 --> 00:12:11.853
WELCOMED, AND I COULD NOT HELP

00:12:11.854 --> 00:12:16.157
BUT THINK WHAT HAS HAPPENED, AND

00:12:16.158 --> 00:12:16.825
OUR STUDENTS WHO HAVE MORE

00:12:16.826 --> 00:12:19.260
CONSERVATIVE VIEWPOINTS

00:12:19.261 --> 00:12:21.129
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BY

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.230
PROFESSORS WHO SAY THERE IS ONLY

00:12:22.231 --> 00:12:25.266
ONE WAY TO THINK?

00:12:25.267 --> 00:12:27.669
DID THEY NOT RESPECT THE PROCESS

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.938
THAT I WENT THROUGH, WHICH I

00:12:29.939 --> 00:12:31.106
THINK EVERYONE WOULD CONCEDE WAS

00:12:31.107 --> 00:12:33.441
EXTREMELY THOROUGH?

00:12:33.442 --> 00:12:37.645
AND IT MADE ME WONDER IF OUR

00:12:37.646 --> 00:12:41.049
LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGES ARE NO

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:43.284
LONGER BASTIONS OF FREE SPEECH

00:12:43.285 --> 00:12:46.287
WHERE PEOPLE CAN ENGAGE IN

00:12:46.288 --> 00:12:47.555
HEALTHY DEBATE AND BRING

00:12:47.556 --> 00:12:50.191
DIFFERING VIEWPOINTS TO THE

00:12:50.192 --> 00:12:50.492
TABLE.

00:12:50.493 --> 00:12:51.760
THAT IS WHAT LIBERAL ARTS

00:12:51.761 --> 00:12:53.962
COLLEGE AND EDUCATION IS

00:12:53.963 --> 00:12:55.196
SUPPOSED TO BE ALL ABOUT, AND

00:12:55.197 --> 00:12:57.432
THAT IS WHAT IT WAS LIKE AT

00:12:57.433 --> 00:13:01.569
ST. LAWRENCE WHEN I WAS THERE.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:02.337
I LEARNED SO MUCH BECAUSE OF

00:13:02.338 --> 00:13:02.637
THAT.

00:13:02.638 --> 00:13:04.706
&gt;&gt; Martha: WHAT ARE YOUR

00:13:04.707 --> 00:13:08.676
THOUGHTS ON THE #MeToo TO

00:13:08.677 --> 00:13:09.344
MOVEMENT.

00:13:09.345 --> 00:13:10.912
&gt;&gt; IT HAS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT

00:13:10.913 --> 00:13:11.946
FOR OUR COUNTRY.

00:13:11.947 --> 00:13:14.149
IT IS NEEDED AND HAS HELPED TO

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:15.950
HEIGHTEN AWARENESS, AND I HOPE

00:13:15.951 --> 00:13:18.453
THAT IF ANYTHING GOOD HAS COME

00:13:18.454 --> 00:13:22.290
OUT OF THIS TERRIBLE PROCESS, IT

00:13:22.291 --> 00:13:27.095
IS THAT THE SURVIVORS OF

00:13:27.096 --> 00:13:28.329
SEXUAL ASSAULT WILL FEEL MORE

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.299
EMPOWERED TO COME FORWARD, AND

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.269
THAT THEY WILL COME FORWARD AT

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.871
THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, AND

00:13:36.872 --> 00:13:41.643
THAT THEY WILL BE HEARD.

00:13:41.644 --> 00:13:43.511
NOT EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE

00:13:43.512 --> 00:13:46.548
GIVING AN ACCURATE STORY, BUT

00:13:46.549 --> 00:13:50.518
EVERYONE DESERVES TO BE TREATED

00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:50.952
WITH RESPECT.

00:13:50.953 --> 00:13:51.920
&gt;&gt; Martha: IT COULD

00:13:51.921 --> 00:13:52.587
POTENTIALLY COST YOU YOUR

00:13:52.588 --> 00:13:54.355
ELECTION IN 2020.

00:13:54.356 --> 00:13:55.657
ARE YOU AT PEACE WITH THAT?

00:13:55.658 --> 00:13:57.892
&gt;&gt; I AM.

00:13:57.893 --> 00:14:01.329
THE EASIER VOTE POLITICALLY

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:02.063
CLEARLY WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR ME

00:14:02.064 --> 00:14:04.999
TO VOTE NO, BUT THAT WOULD NOT

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.035
HAVE BEEN THE RIGHT VOTE.

00:14:07.036 --> 00:14:10.772
AND I HAVE TO LIVE WITH MYSELF.

00:14:10.773 --> 00:14:12.173
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO LOOK IN THE

00:14:12.174 --> 00:14:15.043
MIRROR IN THE MORNING AND KNOW

00:14:15.044 --> 00:14:16.311
THAT I DID WHAT I FELT WAS

00:14:16.312 --> 00:14:19.481
RIGHT, NO MATTER WHAT THE

00:14:19.482 --> 00:14:22.484
CONSEQUENCES MAY BE.

00:14:22.485 --> 00:14:24.652
MY JOB AS A UNITED STATES

00:14:24.653 --> 00:14:28.890
SENATOR IS TO APPLY MY BEST

00:14:28.891 --> 00:14:29.791
JUDGMENT, AND THAT IS WHAT I DID

00:14:29.792 --> 00:14:33.628
IN THIS CASE, DESPITE TREMENDOUS

00:14:33.629 --> 00:14:36.798
PRESSURE, HORRIBLE TACTICS,

00:14:36.799 --> 00:14:37.799
ABUSE OF MY FAMILY, MY STAFF,

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.537
AND MYSELF.

00:14:42.538 --> 00:14:44.739
BUT I REALLY WON'T EVER BE

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.373
INTIMIDATED.

00:14:45.374 --> 00:14:48.143
I HAVE TO DO WHAT I THINK IS
