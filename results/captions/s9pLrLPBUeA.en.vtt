PRIMARY WAS CONSERVATIVE RADIO

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:16.382
WELL, HE NOW SAYS HE WOULD

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:18.417
GLADLY VOTE FOR TRUMP IN 2020.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:20.586
HE’S HERE TO EXPLAIN THAT AND

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:23.222
WEIGH IN ON THE NEW RADICAL

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.892
EXTREME DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:26.392
PARTY.

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:27.460
GLENN BECK HIMSELF.

00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:30.263
ALSO THE AUTHOR OF THE UPCOMING

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:34.600
BOOK "ADDICTED TO OUTRAGE."

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:36.102
YOU ARE NOT BEING BROUGHT ON

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:38.571
THIS PROGRAM IN ANY WAY -- WE

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:40.340
GOT ALONG GREAT FOR A WHILE.

00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:43.076
YOU WERE VERY GENEROUS TO ME AT

00:00:43.077 --> 00:00:45.845
ONE POINT WHEN I NEEDED A RADIO
YOU WERE VERY GENEROUS TO ME AT

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:47.912
ONE POINT WHEN I NEEDED A RADIO

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:46.179
STUDIO.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.647
YOU NEVER CHARGED ME A PENNY.

00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:48.615
&gt;&gt; LISTEN TO ME.

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:51.084
WE ARE -- WE ARE -- WE BOTH

00:00:51.085 --> 00:00:52.919
BELIEVE THAT OUR COUNTRY IS IN

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.253
TROUBLE.

00:00:53.254 --> 00:00:53.987
WE’RE BOTH MEN THAT ARE VERY

00:00:53.988 --> 00:00:56.189
PASSIONATE.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.691
AND THERE’S NOTHING WRONG WITH

00:00:57.692 --> 00:00:58.024
THAT.

00:00:58.025 --> 00:00:59.392
&gt;&gt; Sean: NO, NO.

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:00.760
&gt;&gt; I’M MORE THAN HAPPY THAT

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:03.697
YOU -- THAT YOU REACHED OUT AND

00:01:03.698 --> 00:01:04.264
WANTED TO TALK.

00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:06.066
&gt;&gt; Sean: LET ME ASK YOU,

00:01:06.067 --> 00:01:09.302
BECAUSE, LOOK, YOU’VE ALWAYS

00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:10.570
BEEN AN ENTERTAINER AND

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:13.306
PERFORMER IN SO MANY WAYS.

00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:16.143
YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY’S VIEWS

00:01:16.144 --> 00:01:17.277
VARY.

00:01:17.278 --> 00:01:20.480
WE WATCHED CHEETOS, THE DAY

00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:21.982
AFTER TRUMP WAS ELECTED.

00:01:21.983 --> 00:01:23.750
YOU COMPARED TRUMP’S WIN TO WHAT

00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:27.287
HAPPENED IN GERMANY IN 1933.

00:01:27.288 --> 00:01:30.057
YOU REALLY LOST ME HANGING OUT

00:01:30.058 --> 00:01:31.692
WITH SAMANTHA BEE.

00:01:31.693 --> 00:01:35.129
THAT WAS TO ME A DIFFERENT

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.429
POINT.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.196
&gt;&gt; I WASN’T HANGING OUT -- I

00:01:36.197 --> 00:01:38.932
WASN’T HANGING OUT WITH SAMANTHA

00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:39.667
BEE.

00:01:39.668 --> 00:01:43.971
LOOK, I THINK I’VE BEEN VERY

00:01:43.972 --> 00:01:44.371
CONSISTENT.

00:01:44.372 --> 00:01:46.440
I WAS JUDGING DONALD TRUMP ON

00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:48.275
HIS RECORD PRIOR TO BEING

00:01:48.276 --> 00:01:51.545
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

00:01:51.546 --> 00:01:53.047
THAT’S ALL YOU HAD TO JUDGE HIM

00:01:53.048 --> 00:01:53.347
ON.

00:01:53.348 --> 00:01:56.550
I SAID AFTER THE ELECTION THAT

00:01:56.551 --> 00:01:59.186
HE IS MY PRESIDENT, HE IS ALL OF

00:01:59.187 --> 00:02:01.188
OUR PRESIDENTS, AND IT IS IN OUR
HE IS MY PRESIDENT, HE IS ALL OF

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.557
OUR PRESIDENTS, AND IT IS IN OURBEST INTEREST THAT OUR PRESIDENT

00:02:03.558 --> 00:02:05.691
BEST INTEREST THAT OUR PRESIDENT

00:02:03.558 --> 00:02:03.925
SUCCEEDS.

00:02:03.926 --> 00:02:05.726
AND I WANT HIM TO SUCCEED.

00:02:05.727 --> 00:02:07.562
AND I SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

00:02:07.563 --> 00:02:08.496
I HOPE THAT I’M WRONG.

00:02:08.497 --> 00:02:10.498
IF I AM, I’LL BE THE FIRST TO

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:11.165
ADMIT IT.

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:13.134
ONCE HE GOT INTO OFFICE, NOW

00:02:13.135 --> 00:02:13.935
HE’S THE PRESIDENT.

00:02:13.936 --> 00:02:15.703
NOW I’M NOT JUDGING HIM ON THE

00:02:15.704 --> 00:02:16.037
PAST.

00:02:16.038 --> 00:02:18.439
I’M JUDGING ON WHAT HE’S DOING.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.208
AND I CALL BALLS AND STRIKES.

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.176
QUITE HONESTLY, SEAN, EARLY ON,

00:02:22.177 --> 00:02:23.745
I SAID I NEVER THOUGHT HE WOULD
QUITE HONESTLY, SEAN, EARLY ON,

00:02:23.746 --> 00:02:25.812
I SAID I NEVER THOUGHT HE WOULD

00:02:23.746 --> 00:02:26.815
DO THAT, I NEVER THOUGHT HE

00:02:26.816 --> 00:02:27.882
WOULD DO THAT, I NEVER THOUGHT

00:02:27.883 --> 00:02:28.850
HE WOULD DO THAT.

00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:31.319
BY THE TIME HE GOT TO ISRAEL, HE

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.420
WAS PROVING ME WRONG EVERY STEP
BY THE TIME HE GOT TO ISRAEL, HE

00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:34.487
WAS PROVING ME WRONG EVERY STEP

00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:35.657
OF THE WAY ON HIS POLICIES.

00:02:35.658 --> 00:02:39.060
I WAS HAPPY, THRILLED, THRILLED

00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:40.929
TO SAY HE’S DOING THE THINGS HE
I WAS HAPPY, THRILLED, THRILLED

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.130
TO SAY HE’S DOING THE THINGS HE

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.130
SAID HE WOULD DO.

00:02:42.131 --> 00:02:44.866
I THINK THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN

00:02:44.867 --> 00:02:47.235
SINCE HE GOT INTO OFFICE ON

00:02:47.236 --> 00:02:49.004
POLICIES, THE DEMOCRATIC -- I’M

00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:50.372
SORRY, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

00:02:50.373 --> 00:02:51.973
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, HE -- HE

00:02:51.974 --> 00:02:54.910
IS THE GREATEST MISDIRECTION OF

00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:55.577
ALL TIME.

00:02:55.578 --> 00:02:57.446
ALL HE HAS TO DO IS JUST TWEET

00:02:57.447 --> 00:02:59.381
SOMETHING AND THE MEDIA GOES

00:02:59.382 --> 00:03:00.082
CRAZY.

00:03:00.083 --> 00:03:01.650
THEY COULD HAVE PASSED ANYTHING.

00:03:01.651 --> 00:03:02.351
AND HE WOULD HAVE SIGNED IT.

00:03:02.352 --> 00:03:04.853
THEY DIDN’T.

00:03:04.854 --> 00:03:07.723
I ASKED WHAT’S WRONG WITH THE

00:03:07.724 --> 00:03:08.624
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:10.225
&gt;&gt; Sean: YOU KNOW, TO ME THERE

00:03:10.226 --> 00:03:11.660
ARE WAY TOO MANY REPUBLICANS.

00:03:11.661 --> 00:03:14.430
WE LEARNED THIS OVER OBAMACARE.

00:03:14.431 --> 00:03:16.598
SHOW VOTES FOR REPEAL AND

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.702
REPLACE, 65 OF THEM.

00:03:19.703 --> 00:03:21.337
REAL VOTES, SPINELESS,

00:03:21.338 --> 00:03:26.208
VISIONLESS, FECKLESS.

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:26.709
&gt;&gt; Sean: NOTHING.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.244
THE ONLY THING IS -- AND I MIGHT

00:03:28.245 --> 00:03:29.678
HAVE HAD AN ADVANTAGE THAT YOU

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:30.112
DIDN’T HAVE.

00:03:30.113 --> 00:03:32.782
LIKE YOU, I WENT OUT ON A LIMB.

00:03:32.783 --> 00:03:34.750
I TOLD MY CONSERVATIVE AUDIENCE

00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:35.918
WHAT I KNEW ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:37.953
AND IF YOU LOOKED AT HIS RECORD,

00:03:37.954 --> 00:03:41.190
GAVE MONEY TO DEMOCRATS, EVEN

00:03:41.191 --> 00:03:42.058
HILLARY CLINTON, SAID NICE

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:43.259
THINGS ABOUT DEMOCRATS.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.995
I ALWAYS KNEW THAT THAT WAS HIM

00:03:45.996 --> 00:03:47.263
PLAYING THE POLITICAL GAME.

00:03:47.264 --> 00:03:48.998
HE EVEN SAID IT, I’M PLAYING THE

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:50.466
GAME IN NEW YORK SO I CAN KEEP

00:03:50.467 --> 00:03:54.504
MY BUILDINGS GOING UP,

00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:55.571
ELECTRICIANS, PLUMBERS, STEEL

00:03:55.572 --> 00:03:56.873
WORKERS WORKING AND I’M STILL IN

00:03:56.874 --> 00:03:57.273
BUSINESS.

00:03:57.274 --> 00:03:58.875
OTHERWISE, YOU’RE GOING TO BE

00:03:58.876 --> 00:03:59.475
SHUT OUT.

00:03:59.476 --> 00:04:02.312
AS YOU LOOK AT THE THINGS HE’S

00:04:02.313 --> 00:04:03.613
DONE -- AND THE WAY I LOOK AT

00:04:03.614 --> 00:04:05.315
IT, BIGGEST TAX CUTS,

00:04:05.316 --> 00:04:07.650
CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES, FIGHTING

00:04:07.651 --> 00:04:08.852
LIKE -- WITH EVERYTHING HE’S GOT
CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES, FIGHTING

00:04:08.853 --> 00:04:11.119
LIKE -- WITH EVERYTHING HE’S GOT

00:04:08.853 --> 00:04:10.954
TO GET THE BORDER WALL BECAUSE

00:04:10.955 --> 00:04:12.655
HE MADE THE PROMISE, ISRAEL IS

00:04:12.656 --> 00:04:13.189
ANOTHER.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.558
GETTING OUT OF THE IRANIAN DEAL.

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:17.727
EVEN THE CONCESSIONS THAT HE

00:04:17.728 --> 00:04:18.094
GOT --

00:04:18.095 --> 00:04:20.196
&gt;&gt; STANDING FOR ABORTION.

00:04:20.197 --> 00:04:21.831
STANDING FOR ABORTION.

00:04:21.832 --> 00:04:22.999
SAYING THAT HE’S AGAINST

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.366
SOCIALISM.

00:04:23.367 --> 00:04:26.303
I WAS THERE AT THE STATE OF THE

00:04:26.304 --> 00:04:26.603
UNION.

00:04:26.604 --> 00:04:27.304
AND I WATCHED THE DEMOCRATS.

00:04:27.305 --> 00:04:30.540
I WAS SITTING RIGHT ACROSS FROM

00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:31.708
THE PRESIDENT IN THE BACK.

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:34.544
THAT’S THE WAY THAT THING YOU

00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:35.512
SHOULD BE SHOT.

00:04:35.513 --> 00:04:38.982
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE WHO’S

00:04:38.983 --> 00:04:43.120
TEXTING, LAUGHING, POKING EACH

00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:43.820
OTHER --

00:04:43.821 --> 00:04:45.756
&gt;&gt; Sean: PREDICTIONS --

00:04:45.757 --> 00:04:47.724
&gt;&gt; I -- I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD

00:04:47.725 --> 00:04:48.425
SAY THIS.

00:04:48.426 --> 00:04:51.261
BUT I LEFT THERE THINKING I

00:04:51.262 --> 00:04:54.131
DON’T THINK I WOULD HAVE HAD THE

00:04:54.132 --> 00:04:55.299
RESTRAINT THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS.
DON’T THINK I WOULD HAVE HAD THE

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.135
RESTRAINT THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS.THEY WERE HISSING HIM, THEY WERE

00:04:58.136 --> 00:05:00.269
THEY WERE HISSING HIM, THEY WERE

00:04:58.136 --> 00:04:59.203
MOCKING HIM THE WHOLE TIME.

00:04:59.204 --> 00:05:01.672
AND YOU DIDN’T SEE IT OR HEAR IT

00:05:01.673 --> 00:05:02.306
ON TELEVISION.

00:05:02.307 --> 00:05:03.674
BECAUSE I WENT BACK AND WATCHED.

00:05:03.675 --> 00:05:05.008
THERE IS A CLICK NOW

00:05:03.675 --> 00:05:07.511
BECAUSE I WENT BACK AND WATCHED.

00:05:07.512 --> 00:05:08.312
THERE IS A CLIQUE NOW IN THE

00:05:08.313 --> 00:05:10.014
DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT ARE AS

00:05:10.015 --> 00:05:11.582
RADICAL AS RADICAL CAN COME.

00:05:11.583 --> 00:05:13.250
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS TOLD I WAS

00:05:13.251 --> 00:05:14.819
A RACIST FOR SAYING THAT PEOPLE
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS TOLD I WAS

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.886
A RACIST FOR SAYING THAT PEOPLE

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.920
WERE SOCIALIST AND THE

00:05:15.921 --> 00:05:19.724
DEMOCRATIC PARTY WAS GOING TO

00:05:19.725 --> 00:05:23.261
BECOME ANTI-SEMITIC AND

00:05:23.262 --> 00:05:23.628
SOCIALIST.

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:24.929
THAT’S WHO THEY ARE AND THEY

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.264
WANT TO SAY THAT.

00:05:26.265 --> 00:05:28.032
WELL, HERE WE ARE.

00:05:28.033 --> 00:05:30.702
WE ARE NOW AT A POINT WHERE IF

00:05:30.703 --> 00:05:31.602
YOU -- GO AHEAD.

00:05:31.603 --> 00:05:33.571
&gt;&gt; Sean: LET ME THEN ASK THIS.

00:05:33.572 --> 00:05:34.973
YOU SEE THE NEW GREEN DEAL.

00:05:34.974 --> 00:05:38.376
NO PLANES, NO COWS, NO CARS, NO

00:05:38.377 --> 00:05:39.277
OIL, NO GAS.

00:05:39.278 --> 00:05:40.945
THE PROBLEM IS, IT’S NOT JUST

00:05:40.946 --> 00:05:41.880
ONE CONGRESSWOMAN.

00:05:41.881 --> 00:05:45.183
IT’S A HUNDRED DEMOCRATS AT

00:05:45.184 --> 00:05:45.650
LEAST.

00:05:45.651 --> 00:05:47.852
AND 2020 CONTENDERS.

00:05:47.853 --> 00:05:48.653
THIS IS REAL FOR THEM.

00:05:48.654 --> 00:05:50.321
THEN YOU ADD TO THAT THIS

00:05:50.322 --> 00:05:52.557
ABSOLUTE DISGRACE THEY CAN’T

00:05:52.558 --> 00:05:53.825
EVEN CONDEMN CONGRESSWOMAN OMAR

00:05:53.826 --> 00:05:54.359
IN THIS CASE TODAY.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.061
AND YOU LOOK AT WHERE -- AND

00:05:56.062 --> 00:05:59.431
WERE IMPORTANTLY, I THINK THE

00:05:59.432 --> 00:06:01.900
BIGGEST ABUSE OF POWER,

00:06:01.901 --> 00:06:03.468
CORRUPTION, SCANDAL IN HISTORY

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:05.370
AS IT RELATES TO THE DEEP STATE,

00:06:05.371 --> 00:06:07.539
THOSE AT THE TOP OF THE FBI, NOT
AS IT RELATES TO THE DEEP STATE,

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.673
THOSE AT THE TOP OF THE FBI, NOT

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.774
RANK AND FILE, THOSE IN THE

00:06:08.775 --> 00:06:10.075
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, WHAT THEY

00:06:10.076 --> 00:06:12.377
HAVE DONE AND STILL NOT HELD

00:06:12.378 --> 00:06:13.078
ACCOUNTABLE, BUT I HEAR THEY

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:18.584

&gt;&gt; I WILL JUST TELL YOU THIS.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.222
THE NEW GREEN DEAL IS ONE OF THE

00:06:23.223 --> 00:06:24.756
MOST FRIGHTENING THINGS.

00:06:24.757 --> 00:06:26.191
FORGET ABOUT THE CARS AND STUFF.

00:06:26.192 --> 00:06:27.359
THEY DON’T CARE.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.794
THING.

00:06:28.795 --> 00:06:29.361
THEY DON’T CARE ABOUT THE GREEN

00:06:29.362 --> 00:06:32.031
THE -- THE SECOND PART OF THAT

00:06:32.032 --> 00:06:34.199
IS THE FUNDAMENTAL

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.301
TRANSFORMATION OF OUR ECONOMIC

00:06:35.302 --> 00:06:37.403
SYSTEM AND THAT IS IN THERE.

00:06:37.404 --> 00:06:40.706
THEY ARE LOOKING TO TRANSFORM

00:06:40.707 --> 00:06:41.340
OUR SYSTEM.

00:06:41.341 --> 00:06:44.477
WHEN THEY SAY THE FREE MARKET

00:06:44.478 --> 00:06:45.211
SYSTEM DOESN’T WORK AND IT’S NOT

00:06:45.212 --> 00:06:46.112
GOING TO BE AROUND LONG, THEY

00:06:46.113 --> 00:06:46.846
MEAN IT.

00:06:46.847 --> 00:06:48.881
AND DEMOCRATS -- THE GOOD

00:06:48.882 --> 00:06:51.317
DEMOCRATS IN THE CENTER OF THE

00:06:51.318 --> 00:06:53.052
COUNTRY WHO ARE NOT JUST PLAYING

00:06:53.053 --> 00:06:54.220
POLITICS, THEY’VE GOT TO WAKE UP
COUNTRY WHO ARE NOT JUST PLAYING

00:06:54.221 --> 00:06:56.487

00:06:58.091 --> 00:07:00.993
THESE PEOPLE ARE SERIOUS

00:07:00.994 --> 00:07:02.195
RADICALS.

00:07:02.196 --> 00:07:04.931
THEY HAVE SERIOUS ISSUES WITH --

00:07:04.932 --> 00:07:07.734
WITH RACE AND -- AND

00:07:07.735 --> 00:07:08.468
ANTI-SEMITISM.

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:10.403
THEY ARE SERIOUS SOCIALISTS.

00:07:10.404 --> 00:07:12.405
THEY ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT

00:07:12.406 --> 00:07:12.739
SWEDEN.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.541
THAT IS A FREE MARKET WITH A LOT

00:07:15.542 --> 00:07:18.244
OF WELFARE ON TOP OF IT.

00:07:18.245 --> 00:07:21.481
IT’S NOT A SOCIALIST COUNTRY.

00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:22.782

&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, SEAN, I THINK WHEN
WILL YOU VOTE FOR TRUMP IN 2020?

00:07:29.857 --> 00:07:31.923

SOCIALISTS THAT WANT TO END THE

00:07:33.194 --> 00:07:33.793
FREE MARKET.

00:07:33.794 --> 00:07:35.261
THEY’RE NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT

00:07:35.262 --> 00:07:35.695
ABORTION.

00:07:35.696 --> 00:07:39.199
WE’RE TALKING ABOUT THIRD TRY

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.000
WE’RE TALKING ABOUT THIRD

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.033
TRIMESTER ABORTIONS, WHEN YOU

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:56.550
AND HERE’S WHY.

00:07:56.551 --> 00:08:00.120
ANYONE I EVER SAY I’M VOTING

00:08:00.121 --> 00:08:02.823
FOR, IT’S A KISS OF DEATH.

00:08:02.824 --> 00:08:03.223
[ LAUGHTER ]

HE CALLS ME AND SAYS, DON’T

00:08:10.231 --> 00:08:10.864
ENFORCE ME.

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:12.634
YOU’RE NOT HELPING.
