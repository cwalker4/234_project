00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.570
In an empire so devoid of color, the vibrantly
red-colored Imperial Royal Guards not only

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.290
stood out in their unique appearance but also
in their perfected level of skill in combat.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.500
These guys were the best of the best the empire
had to offer, and they were most likely the

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.580
finest trained non-force sensitive soldiers
in the entire galaxy during the empire’s

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.580
reign.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.690
There’s a reason they were hand picked by
the Emperor himself to guard his excellency.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.440
And since we unfortunately never see them
properly fight in the movies, exactly how

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.729
powerful were the Imperial Royal Guards?

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.960
Before we begin, we want to clarify that the
red guards we see get knocked out by Yoda

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.420
are not even near the same skill level as
the Imperial Royal guards at the height of

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.330
the galactic empire’s reign.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.789
The red guards we see throughout the clone
wars did not go through the same intense training

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.119
that the Imperial royal guards had.

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.020
Instead they were just senate guards, senate
commandos, and other trained soldiers promoted

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.229
by Palpatine based on their loyalty for him.

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.560
Palpatine’s main reason for creating the
Red Guard at the time was to surround himself

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.120
with guards that were solely loyal to him
above all else, so that he could attend his

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.821
alter ego as Darth Sidious and do other secret
things without fear of being spied on or being

00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:24.700
betrayed by one of the senate guards who would
have protected him otherwise.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.450
Just to put things in perspective, a single
Imperial Royal Guard would probably be able

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.650
to take out 4 Red guards with relative ease.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.380
As the Red Guards were picked mainly for their
loyalty, while the Imperial Royal Guards were

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.799
picked for both their loyalty and their extensive
training.

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:46.019
Said extensive training for the Imperial Royal
Guards took place on the harsh, war torn planet

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.250
of Yinchorr.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.750
The trainees who attended this Academy were
chosen for being the strongest, most intelligent

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.630
and gifted soldiers from all across the Imperial
military.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.549
An initial class consisted of about 40 to
50 students, but only about one or two of

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.860
them would eventually graduate from the academy
to become Royal Guards.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.870
They were mainly trained in Echani art, which
was an unarmed combat style which essentially

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.620
turned the practitioner's body into a weapon.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.590
Their reflexes were sharpened to perfection,
to the the point that they could even sometimes

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.160
deflect a blaster bolt in the heat of battle
with just their melee weapons.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.580
Much of their fighting took place amongst
themselves, with the loser of each fight facing

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.970
the possibility of death.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.380
Once they reached a certain point in their
training, they would be greeted by Emperor

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.070
Palpatine, who even he himself showed the
soon to be guards with utmost respect, treating

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.350
them as if they were his own children.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.280
But then again, it wouldn’t be wise to make
the people who would eventually be tasked

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.320
in protecting you dislike you.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.530
So that could also be why he was so respectful
towards them.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.000
Anyway, along with inspecting the remaining
students of the academy, Palpatine then had

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.880
Darth Vader arrive and duel with the best
student in the group.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.570
Those who dueled Vader were almost certainly
doomed to lose, but beating Vader wasn’t

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.570
the point.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.450
It was more of a learning experience for the
other students as they watched their best

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.700
mate get essentially murdered in front of
them as Vader toyed with his opponent before

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.370
ending his life by kicking him down into the
abyss below.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.329
The purpose of this demonstration was to show
them that what they believed was the best

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:24.000
wasn’t even good enough, and in a sinister
kind of way, to encourage them to train harder.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.110
That if they were going to protect the Emperor,
then they would have to be almost unnatural

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.930
in their level of skill in combat.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.630
It was also probably done to perhaps show
them that even if they were considered the

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.200
best the empire had to offer, that they were
still vulnerable to death for their failures.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.800
Many months later, and the very few remaining
students were on course to graduating and

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.460
only had one final test to accomplish.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.320
A final test that would be overseen by the
Emperor himself within his chamber.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.580
Two students would enter the chamber at a
time and kneel before the emperor as he was

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.570
surrounded by Royal guards and Vader.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.410
After they were praised for their remarkable
successes, they then were presented with their

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.770
final test: to fight each other to the death
and the winner will become a Royal guard.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.240
Now the main purpose of the test was to test
the student’s loyalty, as they would be

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.039
fighting someone who they have trained with
and been friends with for months, if not years.

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.570
But their ambitions for becoming a guard overcame
their long friendship and they quickly fought

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.080
as they were ordered, with eventually a victor
emerging.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.740
After being congratulated by the emperor,
the newly confirmed member of the royal guard

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.960
would be reminded by Vader that he shouldn’t
ever be sorry for his actions nor should he

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.960
ever regret a direct order given by his master.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.730
And if the new guard shows signs of possible
defiance, Vader will hurt them and put them

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.200
in their place, reminding them that they are
no match to the power of the dark side that

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.840
both Vader and the Emperor possessed.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.700
Anyway, these guards have demonstrated their
level of skill from time to time again throughout

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.870
the comics.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.830
For example they were able to hold off an
entire private army of clone stormtroopers,

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.570
which were secretly created by a traitorous
Imperial who tried to overthrow the emperor.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.880
They did this with minimal casualties, fending
them off long enough for Palpatine to kill

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.400
the rest of them with his force lightning.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.700
Another case was when a single Imperial Royal
Guard literally turned the tide of an entire

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.180
battle as he fought against stormtroopers
who were being commanded by a traitorous Imperial

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.660
warlord who sought the Imperial throne after
contributing to Palpatine’s death.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.330
This single royal guard cut down scores of
stormtroopers with his vibroblade, with even

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.760
deflecting one blaster bolt at one point.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.510
He eventually took out his heavy blaster pistol
and started to duel wield his weapons, cutting

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.940
down troopers with his vibroblade and shooting
them at a distance with his blaster.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.870
Nearing the end of the battle he even took
out a TIE interceptor by shooting the pilot

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:52.360
through the glass and causing the starfighter
to crash toward the other stormtroopers.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.180
This single gaurd caused the traitorous Imperials
to retreat, with the commander almost having

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:02.060
a nervous breakdown when he was notified that
an Imperial royal guard was fighting alongside

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.889
his enemy.

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:07.650
So on top of their training, these guards
were outfitted with some of the best armor

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.520
the empire had to offer.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.900
The armor provided far better protection than
that of typical stormtrooper armor, but it

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.010
was also designed to be very flexible and
allowed for great movement.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.150
They were armed with force spikes which could
be used to stun or kill enemies, or in some

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.040
cases even torture their victims if needed.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.010
They also were equipped with a heavy blaster
pistol if they required to eliminate longer

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.540
ranged enemies.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:35.220
The armor and blaster were hidden beneath
the guard's long robes, giving a deceptive

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.730
appearance that they were only armed with
force pikes.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.750
Along with their physical combat training,
the guards were also experts at dogfighting

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:48.010
in space, being given their own special red
colored tie interceptors whenever they escorted

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.630
the Emperor’s shuttle.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.450
They were taught a secret language to use
amongst each other during battle as a means

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:57.810
to keep their tactics a secret from the enemy,
and they were more than willing to die than

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.630
give up any information or betray their emperor.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:05.500
Actually when the death of Emperor Palpatine
was confirmed, a huge portion of the royal

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.510
guard committed suicide as they felt they
had failed in protecting him.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:15.410
Those who did not commit suicide, either joined
an Imperial warlord or sought to avenge the

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:19.840
emperor by either fighting the rebels or Imperials
who betrayed the emperor and sought the Imperial

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.940
throne for themselves.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.740
Along with guarding they also were used for
assassination missions, and in some cases

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:31.690
they wore special red colored stormtrooper
armor during special missions.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:35.300
Royal Guards who were exceptionally skilled
in their training and were discovered to be

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:40.080
force sensitive were allowed to join an even
more elite organization called the Imperial

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.199
Sovereign Protectors or the Imperial Shadow
guards.

00:08:44.199 --> 00:08:48.350
Within either of these subset organizations
the guards were trained in the dark side of

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:53.180
the force, and were either equipped with a
doubled-end vibroblade or a red lightsaber

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.180
pike.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.350
 

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:58.790
 

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.930
 

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:02.430
