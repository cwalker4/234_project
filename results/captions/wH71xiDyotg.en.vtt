00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.260
Hi.

00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:00.760
How are you?

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.470
I'm good.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.000
How are you?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.730
I am a huge fan of the show.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:04.890
Well, thank you so much.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.360
I'm a huge fan of you.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.900
Thank you.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.399
Thank you.

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:08.870
Well, we kind of
know each other.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.650
This is-- I can't believe this
is your first time on the show.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.940
That doesn't seem right, right?

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.439
I know.

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:12.974
How come?

00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:15.390
I don't know, but it's good
to be here for the first time.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.890
Yeah.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.530
Well, we're happy to have you.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.470
So we've met many, many times.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.330
You've been to my house twice.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.640
You came to my house
to look at it to buy,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.390
and then you were trying to
get LeBron James to buy it.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.480
How come he didn't buy it?

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.310
Well, I couldn't afford it.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.890
He could.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.390
I see.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.260
So--

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.030
I see.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.962
You know, that was the
time that he was almost

00:00:35.962 --> 00:00:36.920
coming to the Clippers.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.580
Right.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.680
And then it took kind of a right
turn to South Beach, Miami.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.400
Yeah.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.900
OK.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.110
So, they are happy about that.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.200
So then you came
up for lunch, and I

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.609
understand that you
didn't have a good time.

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:51.650
Well, I had a great time.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.570
So Ellen has a great house,
impeccable taste, the artwork,

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.280
to die for.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.817
The problem came when
she served my lunch.

00:01:01.817 --> 00:01:03.650
She thought I was like
a model or something.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.420
Obviously I'm not, because I'm
a big, growing athlete, right?

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.420
6'3", 230 pounds.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.180
And the meal was this small.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.570
And I said, "I hope
there's others coming."

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.730
And nothing came,
so on the way home

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.760
I just stopped at an In-N-Out
Burger and got a good meal.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.045
I'm so sorry, but
then I made up for it.

00:01:23.045 --> 00:01:25.170
There's a ton of stuff in
the dressing room, right?

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.170
Yeah, and it's all Dominican
food, so I love it.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.669
Yeah.

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:28.310
I'm glad.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.380
And then I have some
shots of vodka in case--

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.400
this is your first time.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.140
I didn't know if you'd be
nervous, so I just thought

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.100
if you want to do a shot--

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.260
Well, since I didn't make your
party a couple weeks ago--

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.870
Yeah, what happened?

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.078
Why weren't you at the party?

00:01:38.078 --> 00:01:39.260
Yeah, I wasn't invited.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.350
That is not--

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.770
Jennifer-- Jennifer was
one of the first ones there

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.270
and one of the
last ones to leave.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.920
Danced the entire time.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.690
She got everyone out
on the dance floor.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:48.230
And how was she?

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.855
Did she behave?

00:01:48.855 --> 00:01:49.740
She was amazing.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.240
Yeah.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.580
She and Melissa McCarthy
had a dance-off, which was--

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.600
I think Melissa scared her.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.350
But it was so fun.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.260
Where were you?

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.421
I was actually in Miami
with my daughters.

00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:00.920
Oh.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.180
Well, you missed a good one.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.750
I heard.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.250
I heard.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.296
I was disappointed.

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:06.670
So do you need to do a shot
because you missed the party?

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.794
Is that what you're saying?

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:12.950
First of all, I love this show.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.325
This is my first
time, but I feel

00:02:14.325 --> 00:02:17.482
like I've been here
many times, so cheers.

00:02:17.482 --> 00:02:22.071
To feeling like you've
been many times.

00:02:22.071 --> 00:02:22.570
Whoo.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.170
All right.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.184
So I have to show you--

00:02:26.184 --> 00:02:28.100
this is your first time,
so what we like to do

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.100
is we like to remind people
of someone's body of work

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.188
because, you know, so let's
show a few pictures of--

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.610
So there's that.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.850
And there's that.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.000
You know, just your body
of work, just you know,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.350
just because people
need to see that.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.090
So you work out
every single day?

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.780
Well.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.538
You're infatuated with yourself.

00:03:01.538 --> 00:03:04.750
You can't stop
looking at yourself.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.590
I just couldn't believe
what I was seeing.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.410
That's how we feel.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.870
Not every day, but I definitely
try to break a sweat every day,

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:15.540
and I love it.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.140
In what way?

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.200
In every way.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.700
So, wait.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.190
I have to ask you,
because when Jen was here,

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.810
when you all first
got together, I

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.870
asked her her side of the
story of how you all met.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.310
So she told me her side of
the story of how you met.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.660
So I want to hear your
side of how you met.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.160
Yeah.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.070
So I describe it as the
luckiest day of my life.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.870
But I was having a lunch with
two women from my office,

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.410
and we then jumped into a room
and had a conference call.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.760
It was very complicated.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.490
Anyways, long story
short, I'm walking outside

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.190
and I forget where
I park my car.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.100
I have no idea, and for 10 or
12 minutes I'm sitting there.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.094
And I'm kind of
getting upset now

00:04:03.094 --> 00:04:04.260
because I'm like how can I--

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.820
Well, anyway, someone
taps me on the shoulder,

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.540
and I turn around.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.780
And I do not
recognize this person.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.410
And it's Jennifer, She's
dressed up as Harlee

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.541
from Shades of Blue, and she's
in her jeans and her big boots.

00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:21.290
And it took me about
four or five seconds,

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.895
and she said, "It's Jennifer.

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:23.540
It's Jennifer."

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.310
I go, "Oh my god, Jennifer.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.750
You look beautiful."

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.210
I was so embarrassed, and
then I got a little nervous,

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.704
and I'm like this is so goofy.

00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:32.870
We all know who Jennifer is.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.130
She's everywhere.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.860
And then we basically had a
small chit-chat, and she said--

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.610
I said, "I'm here.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.109
I'm in LA.

00:04:41.109 --> 00:04:44.010
I'm doing some work
for Fox, and I'm here,

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.784
and what are you doing?"

00:04:45.784 --> 00:04:47.450
And she says, "Well,
you have my number.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:48.620
Reach out."

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.964
And I went home that
night and I reached out.

00:04:52.964 --> 00:04:56.303
Well, totally different story.

00:04:56.303 --> 00:05:00.170
First of all, how did you
have her number already?

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.570
That was because we were looking
at someone in the fitness

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.860
space, and I wanted
to get a referral.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.360
I see.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.590
And it was just very basic.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.160
Right.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.440
OK.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.939
So that's a totally
different story.

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:16.430
She says you went up to her, and
you approached her at the table

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.747
and started talking.

00:05:17.747 --> 00:05:18.330
Oh my god, no.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.130
I'm pretty sure.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.510
No, no, no, no.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.786
Maybe I'm remembering it
wrong, but isn't that what--

00:05:22.786 --> 00:05:23.660
that's what she said.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.924
She said you approached her.

00:05:25.924 --> 00:05:26.840
You know what's funny?

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.997
Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas,
her partner,

00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:32.330
was the one that saw me first,
which I can't believe it,

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.830
because she knows
nothing about baseball.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.730
And then Jennifer saw it,
and, you know, minutes later,

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.490
we saw her outside.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.140
All right, well,
one of you is lying.
