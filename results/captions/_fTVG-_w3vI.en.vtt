00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:08.730
let me tell you about the name Kevin in
Germany hey guys what's up it's Kelly

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.410
again and welcome back to my channel! I
just did a video for you guys talking

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.359
about surnames in Germany and now I'm
going to do a video to talk to you guys

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.800
about first name differences between
Germany and the US. now if you had told

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.460
me a few years ago that there are a lot
of differences between first names in

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.880
Germany and the US I probably would have
looked at you and been like yeah they're

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.989
different countries they have different
names, obviously. but that's really not

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.770
all there is to it. first, I want to
clarify something that I've heard some

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.390
grumblings about among my German friends and acquaintances. I guess there have

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.480
been some instances where Americans have expressed the expectation that their

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.539
US. American name can be translated
into German and then conversely that a

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.879
German name can be translated into a
US. American name. and yeah, as I'm

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.830
saying this especially, it sounds really
pretty stupid. but I think that I can

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.430
shed some light onto why that sort of
idea would exist. so when Americans go to

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.500
high school they will most likely learn
a language. they will learn either

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.450
Spanish French or German... maybe there
will only be Spanish depending on the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.439
school district, maybe they'll have some
other languages like Italian or Russian...

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.210
it all depends on the school, and the
funding, and the availability of teachers

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.820
in that area. but these language teachers
will oftentimes assign their students

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.030
with a new name that correlates with
whatever language they're learning as

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.460
sort of an idea to get them into the
mindset of being ready to speak in that

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.930
language. so for example I learned
Spanish in high school,

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.750
regrettably I did not learn German, I
learned Spanish, and students in my class

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:06.369
with me with names like Mark and
Matt and Emily became Mateo and Marco

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:12.690
and Emilia. that was their Spanish
assigned name so it sort of seemed like

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.400
their name was translated into Spanish
but really it was just the Spanish

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.290
version of their name.
now of course names like mine, Kelly, does

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.599
not have a translation into Spanish. it
doesn't have a Spanish version and

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:34.780
similarly it doesn't have a German
version so I kind of always understood

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.880
that my name didn't translate into
another language but you can see why

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.760
someone might think that this is the
case that there is you know a version of

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.579
their name in every single language.
right, so moving on. in the US a lot of

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:56.709
times longer names will be shortened.
so someone named Stephanie might go by

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:03.099
Steph, Stephen might become Steve Matthew might become Matt, Benjamin will become

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.030
Ben. I don't think that this is any
different from what you would see in

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.989
Germany - they shorten names there too.
but I think what is really

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.970
surprising for a lot of Germans is to
hear that sometimes the shortened

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.250
version of an original name looks
nothing like the original name and

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.230
sometimes it actually isn't even any
shorter. so let me give you an example -

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:35.230
our 42nd President Bill Clinton's real
name is William, not Bill. He goes by Bill

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.290
which is a diminutive form of William so
if you meet an American with the name

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.599
William, they might go by William, they
might go by Will like Will Ferrell or

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:52.930
they might go by Bill  - for example Bill
Gates. His real name is William, but he

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.139
goes by Bill. so for another example, our
vice president for George Bush is Dick

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:05.530
Cheney but his real name isn't Dick, his
real name is Richard. Dick is just the

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.230
diminutive form of Richard. so if you
meet an American with

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.950
Richard they might go by Richard, they
might go by Rich, which of course makes

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.600
sense it's just a shortened version, they
might go by Rick, which yeah you can see

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.340
that, or they might go by Dick which
looks really nothing like Richard.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.050
Another example, we'll just stick with
politics, Senator Chuck Schumer is the

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.110
Minority Leader for the Senate in
the US, and his real name is Charles.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:40.100
Chuck is the nickname for Charles. and on
the Senate Majority is Senator Ted Cruz

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:48.110
whose real name is Rafael Edward Cruz
but Ted is the diminutive form of the

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.789
name Edward. so if you meet someone named Edward they might go by Edward or they

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:58.070
might go by Ed, they might go by Eddie,
or they could go by Ted. Ted is the one

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.960
that doesn't really fit with Edward.
where does that T come from? nobody knows

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.729
where the T comes from. moving on to some Hollywood examples - Jim Carrey is a

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:13.789
famous actor in his real name is James
because Jim is the diminutive form of

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:20.630
James. and finally, Jack Nicholson who is
a very famous actor and screenwriter, his

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.849
real name is actually John. and this is
one that I find to be the most confusing

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.919
of all of the examples that I've already
given you because John is no shorter

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:37.220
than Jack. it's already a very, very short
one syllable name and it looks nothing

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:44.330
like Jack but yet John will become Jack.
so it's not actually Jack Nicholson his

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.400
name is John Nicholson. I didn't really
see this as a thing in Germany. what I

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.780
did see was shortened versions that I
mentioned earlier. things that make sense.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.580
they correlate very strongly with each
other. so Benjamin would become Bennie or

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:04.190
Ben. Christoph would become Chris. Michail will become Micha. but these are also

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.050
used in very casual settings among
friends and my friend Bennie would never

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:15.050
sign a document as Bennie it would always
be Benjamin. but in the US, people

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.980
like Dick Cheney will sign documents as
Dick Cheney

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.670
even though his real name is Richard.
Another big difference that I noticed

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.980
between Germany and the US are middle
names in that a lot of Americans will

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:33.950
have middle names and middle names in
Germany just aren't common at all and

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.480
even stranger perhaps is the fact that a
lot of Americans will use their middle

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.790
name as their first name. so going back
to my example of Senator Cruz, you

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.830
probably heard me and picked up on the
fact that I said his full name is Rafael

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:55.490
Edward Cruz but that he goes by Ted
Cruz. Ted being the diminutive form of

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:02.090
the name Edward which is his middle name, not even his first name. I know a lot of

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.260
people in my life that used their middle
name as their first name but of course

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.440
you don't know those people, so I'll
stick with some celebrity examples here.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.710
Bradley Pitt his first name is actually
William but he goes by his middle name

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:21.050
Bradley or the shortened version of it
Brad. Dakota Fanning is a big actress

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:26.630
here and her real first name is actually
Hannah she goes by Dakota which is her

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:31.790
middle name and Meghan Markel is the
princess that married one of the people

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:36.650
I don't really remember one of the royal
people and her middle name is Meghan

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:42.170
while her first name is actually Rachel.
I think I most often see people in the

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:46.070
US taking their middle name on as
their first name if they share the same

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:50.180
first name as their father and I say
father because usually this is with men.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:55.190
so for example, I have a friend whose
first name is Frederick. it's the same

00:07:55.190 --> 00:08:00.320
first name his father has and so my
friend goes by Benjamin which is his

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.220
middle name and so that way if the
family's ever together it's not

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.790
confusing if someone just yells
Frederick, both people turn around to

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:13.070
look and see which one is needed, they're
able to say Frederick or Benjamin. in

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.770
fact I see a lot of people in the US
using the same name

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:22.710
generation after generation and they
start to add suffixes at the end of the

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:28.110
name, so for example junior or the third
or the fourth in order to differentiate

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:33.570
between the people and denote some sort
of distinction. so Bill Gates who I

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:38.669
mentioned earlier is named William Henry
Gates which is the same exact name of

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:44.490
both his father and his grandfather and
so Bill Gates is actually William Henry

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:49.470
Gates the Third. but I don't think this
is happening in Germany I can't think of

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:54.420
a single time I've met like a Martin
Hofman the Third or anything like this.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.220
another thing I noticed in Germany is
that there seem to be really strong

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:03.570
associations with certain names. so I'll
use my name for example. I can't tell you

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:08.880
how many times I've had people tell me
when I introduced myself or even write

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:15.089
on my youtube-channel saying "oh my gosh
Kelly just like the character in married

00:09:15.089 --> 00:09:20.010
with children" or "just like the character
in Beverly Hills 90210" and every time I

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:24.329
actually I have to laugh at this because
they will oftentimes be people that are

00:09:24.329 --> 00:09:29.370
the same age as me and I never, guys, I
never saw an episode of married with

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:35.940
children because it ended in 1997. I was
10 years old at the time so I actually

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:41.070
don't know who this Kelly character is
that everybody thinks I'm related to or

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:46.560
named after and I barely remember seeing
Beverly Hills 90210 with my older sister

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.579
it was one of her favorite TV shows so
it just makes me laugh because I can't

00:09:50.579 --> 00:09:54.990
even really relate to what their
references are but those references are

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:59.370
always brought up when I introduce
myself to a German it seems. now I can

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:03.959
understand why this association would
happen. I mean my name is foreign in Germany

00:10:03.959 --> 00:10:09.240
so of course people will relate it to
the one or two other times that they've

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:14.670
ever heard the name Kelly before but it
goes even further than this. let me tell

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:20.130
you about the name Kevin in Germany.
according to Die Welt, the name Kevin was

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:24.240
the most popular name
in Germany in 1991 but despite its

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.800
former popularity there is quite a
negative stigma attached to this name

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:34.019
now generating terms like Kevinitis and
Kevinism. there was a study done by the

00:10:34.019 --> 00:10:39.449
University of Oldenburg that found that
teachers associated the name Kevin with

00:10:39.449 --> 00:10:45.240
poor behavior and that they actually
graded homework and papers written by

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:50.029
students named Kevin far more harshly
than students bearing other names

00:10:50.029 --> 00:10:55.019
obviously this disadvantages a kid
solely for the fact that his name is

00:10:55.019 --> 00:10:58.860
Kevin and it became a topic of
discussion in Germany where a lot of

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:04.589
sociologists weighed in on whether or not
anglo-american names like Kevin or Mandy

00:11:04.589 --> 00:11:09.920
or like my name Kelly had some sort of
indication for a lower socioeconomic

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.730
status. this reminds me of a little story
that I'm gonna share with you guys where

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:18.810
there's really quite a few things to
unpack here but I went on a couple dates

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:24.120
with a German guy and I think it was
like our third date he said to me "you

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:29.129
know Kelly is a really trashy name in
Germany" and this stopped me in my tracks

00:11:29.129 --> 00:11:36.000
actually because first of all, why would
my name be trashy and 2, why would you

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.610
share this with someone named Kelly? why
would you say, "your name is very trashy

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:48.360
in the country you're living in" so now I
understand the sentiment behind the

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:54.329
statement. he was trying to share a facet
of German culture with me and explained

00:11:54.329 --> 00:11:59.309
that there is this sort of stigma in
Germany behind anglo-american names and

00:11:59.309 --> 00:12:03.149
then 2, I think it was really an
introduction to the differences between

00:12:03.149 --> 00:12:08.250
dating and American versus a German
where a lot of Germans are more blunt

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:12.509
and forthright with sharing
controversial statements with people

00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:16.889
right after meeting them. so back to
names one last thing that really

00:12:16.889 --> 00:12:21.139
surprised me about first names in
Germany is that the German government

00:12:21.139 --> 00:12:25.790
dictates what you are allowed to name
your child and I

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:31.760
think that this is yet another factor on
the long list of ways that Germans are

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:38.210
more subjected to government regulation
than Americans. in the US, you can pretty

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:42.200
much name your kid anything you want
because it's seen as freedom of speech

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:47.030
or freedom of expression and of course
there's a reason why the German

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:51.200
government does this. the idea behind the
regulation is that the government wants

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.360
to make sure that a child is not
subjected to any sort of ridicule or

00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:01.910
bullying based on their name so with the
idea that they are protecting children,

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:07.700
there's a government office that
actually has to approve of what Germans

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:12.560
name their children. in fact, there's a
list of pre-approved names that you can

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.760
select from but if you want to name your
child something that is not on that list,

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:21.530
you have to seek permission from this
office. I did some research to find some

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:26.660
examples that fit this sort of situation
and I learned about this couple who

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:30.440
wanted to name their child Berlin and I
think that this would really resonate

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.700
with a lot of Americans because there
are oftentimes people who name their

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:41.150
children after a place that means
something to the parents and so this

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:44.990
couple wanted to name their child Berlin
because it's the city in which they met

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:48.620
and they were denied they were told by
the government that they were not

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:53.000
allowed to name their child Berlin so
they got a lawyer or as we say in the

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.680
US, they lawyered up. I don't know if
anybody says that. and the lawyer was actually

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.960
able to use a precedent where a couple
successfully named their child London

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:08.660
and so this couple was in fact able to
name their kid Berlin. in the US I

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:13.850
don't have to look up examples because I
know so many people with names that I'm

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:20.090
pretty sure would not pass the test in
Germany. for example, I know a couple who

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:26.120
named their two children each after half
of the name of a mascot from my alma

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:32.840
mater, Penn State. so the girl is named
Nittany and the boy is named Lion to

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.339
make up Nittany Lion which is the mascot.
I also

00:14:36.339 --> 00:14:41.920
worked with a guy whose name is Ace and
his twin brother's name is Joker. I know

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:47.230
a guy whose last name is Hunter and he
named his son Buck to make Buck Hunter

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:53.379
and I also know a couple whose last name
is Wiener and they named their first son

00:14:53.379 --> 00:14:58.720
Maximus and their second son Oscar Mayer. what actually got me thinking about

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.620
making this video in the first place was
a news story that broke out a couple

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:08.259
months ago about a child in the US whose
name is Abcde. it's spelled with the

00:15:08.259 --> 00:15:14.499
first five letters of the alphabet and I
guess she was made fun of by a Southwest

00:15:14.499 --> 00:15:19.990
Airlines employee and so it was out in
the news about this crazy name Abcde.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:23.800
and it turns out there are actually
quite a few people in the US already

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:28.120
with this name. it wasn't even the first
time that people had encountered the

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:32.709
name Abcde before. but in Germany it's
not even unorthodox names that aren't

00:15:32.709 --> 00:15:37.480
allowed but also names that don't
accurately indicate the gender of the

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:42.759
baby. there are a lot of names in the
US that are what I would say bi-gender

00:15:42.759 --> 00:15:46.809
but I can't think of any that are in
Germany. correct me if I'm wrong, but I

00:15:46.809 --> 00:15:51.459
can't think of any names that I learned
or met someone in Germany that could be

00:15:51.459 --> 00:15:55.959
used for both males and females. but like
I said in the US there are a ton of

00:15:55.959 --> 00:16:01.929
names. my name for example, Kelly, can be
used for both men and women and then you

00:16:01.929 --> 00:16:07.929
have names like Courtney, Ashley, Dana,
Kelsey, Lindsay...those are all names that

00:16:07.929 --> 00:16:12.459
are predominantly female but can be used
for males as well. and then there's the

00:16:12.459 --> 00:16:16.720
reverse - there are a lot of names that
are predominantly male names that can be

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:23.379
used for females. for example, Sam or Andy or Colby. and then lastly in Germany you

00:16:23.379 --> 00:16:27.459
can't give your child a surname as a
first name you can't name your kid

00:16:27.459 --> 00:16:32.889
Merkel or Kohl but in the US I would
say that this happens a lot. right now,

00:16:32.889 --> 00:16:37.569
there's a very trendy name, Sawyer,
which you probably have heard of the

00:16:37.569 --> 00:16:41.709
character Tom Sawyer and then there's
other names like Kennedy you probably

00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:46.060
have heard of John F Kennedy, Carter like
Jimmy Carter...

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:51.190
I even know a girl whose name is Monroe
as in Marilyn Monroe. now I get this

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:55.900
sentiment behind wanting to protect kids
from being bullied but from my personal

00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:00.850
experience and the opinions I have from
those personal experiences, kids can be

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:06.130
little assholes. they don't need a funny
name to bully someone and I think that

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:10.990
dictating what you're allowed to name
your kid only addresses the symptom of a

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:15.520
larger problem. instead of deciding
whether or not a couple should be

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.930
allowed to name their kid Berlin
maybe the focus should be on teaching

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:24.100
kids not to be little assholes. but I also
don't think that there's been any sort

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:28.329
of study to show that teachers treat
students differently based on their

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:32.470
names so maybe this is some sort of
cultural phenomenon that exists in

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:37.000
Germany that I'm just having a really
hard time understanding as an outsider

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.750
alright guys that's all I've got for you
but I'm really curious about what you

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:44.650
think! do you think that the government
should be able to dictate what you name

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:48.370
your kid? what do you think about the
fact that Bill Clinton's name is

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:52.030
actually William? did you know that
before you watched this video? and what do

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:55.840
you think about Kevinism? I hope that
you guys liked this video and if you did,
