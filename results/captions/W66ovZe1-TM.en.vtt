00:00:23.758 --> 00:00:25.840
SHANE SMITH: Getting into Sudan
was really difficult.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.680
We had to fly to London and wait
at the Sudanese embassy.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.159
Our contact in Sudan had talked
to the ambassador.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:36.220
And so the ambassador had talked
to some minister that

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.590
our contact's father
was friends with.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.210
So we're waiting.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.840
And I'm like, there's no way
this is going to happen.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.890
And at the 11th hour,
we got the visa.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.540
They said OK, got on a
plane, and then flew

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.430
from there to Khartoum.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.280
And the minute you get off the
plane, you're like, what's

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.170
happening here?

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.520
Because everyone's
in the jalabiya.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.270
Everyone's got turbans.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.130
There's no foreign
people there.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.120
There's no white people there.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.100
It's a very deserty airport,
very empty, very hot, at least

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.950
in the Sahara.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.670
Lots of security, lots
of different--

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.340
There's the police.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.010
There's the army.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.010
There's the secret police.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.400
There's this.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.130
There's that.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.290
We talked to our fixer.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.460
And she said, oh by the way,
you might get all of your

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.340
camera gear confiscated
and thrown in jail.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.040
But don't worry, I'll
get you out.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.140
So we were terrified the minute
we got there that we

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.240
were going to get everything
taken away from us.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.920
But when we went through, it
was 4:00 in the morning.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.830
So they were just
tired and bored.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.620
So they just said, OK,
well, go through.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.930
Then they never checked our
bags, which was fantastic.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.150
We've been told that we should
get some bilaja--

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.410
bilajabiya?

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.280
FEMALE SPEAKER: Jalabiya.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.260
SHANE SMITH: Jalabiya.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.380
So that we fit in a
little bit more.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.420
We don't cause so much
consternation.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.510
The minute we get out of the car
here, we're the focus of a

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.970
lot of attention because
they don't get a lot

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.980
of foreigners here.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.350
They're suspicious
of foreigners.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.400
My pink Irish face
is not going to

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.490
do much in a jalabiya.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.150
But we're going to
give it a shot.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.726
And we're going to check
out the market.

00:02:02.726 --> 00:02:04.100
JAMIE-JAMES MEDINA: It's
not as tight as I

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.780
thought it would be.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.343
SHANE SMITH: Am I fitting in?

00:02:23.873 --> 00:02:26.840
All of a sudden, the Sudanese
thought that was so funny, to

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.830
see Americans dressed
up like them, that

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.230
they were a lot nicer.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.520
When we had to get the press
credentials, we met the

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.430
Secretary General of the
Ministry of Information.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.790
And he was dressed in the
exact same tribal garb.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.150
I just grabbed some stuff.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.590
But we had dressed in the
exact same tribal garb.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.820
So he loved me and
said, oh great.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.580
You should go to my friend
the sheikh's

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.110
place to see a madrasa.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.510
The madrasa is a religious
school where you

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.600
just learn the Koran.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.470
Pakistani madrasas were where
the Taliban came out of, which

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.695
were a lot of terrorists
come out of.

00:02:55.695 --> 00:02:57.640
And they are an ideological
training ground for

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.190
terrorists, et cetera,
et cetera.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.320
So Sudan, which is incredibly
closed towards Western media,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.700
and then a Sudanese madrasa
of children who have been

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.160
orphaned by the Darfur conflict
is a huge coup.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:26.846
[SUDANESE MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:26.846 --> 00:03:31.860
SHANE SMITH: A lot of the kids
from Darfur come here, and

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.010
they get put up by the sheikh.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.165
And they just learn the Koran.

00:03:35.165 --> 00:03:35.770
That's it.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.152
The sheikh Is a rich guy,
but he's also a

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:40.360
religious leader, right.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.890
Well, these kids' parents
have been slaughtered.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.530
He brings them and he feeds them
and clothes them, if they

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.850
learn the Koran.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:48.560
Just the Koran.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.095
There's no geography.

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:50.350
There's no mathematics.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.320
There's no foreign language.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.320
There's no nothing.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:04:14.820
[SUDANESE MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.620
SHANE SMITH: So as you're
walking through there, you

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.149
really get a chill, because
you realize the world has

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:20.501
totally polarized.

00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:23.545
And there is Muslim world,
non-Muslim world, the rich

00:04:23.545 --> 00:04:24.020
world, the poor world.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.520
And as you walk through there,
and you see that division so

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.158
clearly defined, it gives
you a shiver.

00:04:30.158 --> 00:04:31.590
And you say, wow.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.364
When I walked out of there,
I was blown away.

00:04:36.364 --> 00:04:38.240
I got back into the car.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.210
And there were these thousands
of kids still burned into my

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.280
head as they were going back
and forth, back and forth.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.190
And a lot of times they
were looking at us.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.460
And they are looking
at us with hatred.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.294
And they're eight years old.

00:04:48.294 --> 00:05:13.046
[SUDANESE MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:16.010
SHANE SMITH: As heavy as the
madrasa was, we went the next

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.980
day to see the alternative.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.290
And it was even worse.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.760
We're here with the Lost Boys
who have been displaced by the

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.520
war in the South
and in Darfur.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.220
And they come here.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.820
They live in a market
just over here.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.600
And a lot of them are addicted
to solvents.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.540
But they're here
playing soccer.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.485
And we're going to see
them do some dancing.

00:05:46.485 --> 00:05:48.920
BARBARA GOULDSBURY: We have a
drop-in center, a learning

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.470
center, a vocational school, and
a residential center here.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.470
SHANE SMITH: And what are they
set up to do exactly?

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.220
BARBARA GOULDSBURY: The learning
center is set up to

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.110
take kids off the street who
have had no education or

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.565
little education to get them up
to an age and a stage where

00:06:02.565 --> 00:06:04.650
they can be reentered into the
regular school system.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.710
SHANE SMITH: And most of these
kids are solvent addicts?

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.490
BARBARA GOULDSBURY: The older
boys that you see around here

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.720
are living on the streets and
the market, and they are

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.952
addicted to solvent
abuse, yes.

00:06:12.952 --> 00:06:13.940
SHANE SMITH: How do they live?

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.140
How do they get food?

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.110
BARBARA GOULDSBURY: They beg.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.020
They steal.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.800
They come here daily for food.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.180
They get a regular meal here.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.647
And apart from that, they
just eat what they can

00:06:24.647 --> 00:06:25.300
get from the market.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.530
SHANE SMITH: Right.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.050
And they live here as
well, some of them?

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.820
BARBARA GOULDSBURY:
Some of them do.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.875
33 of them do.

00:06:29.875 --> 00:06:32.565
But the older boys that you see
[INAUDIBLE], they live in

00:06:32.565 --> 00:06:33.225
the market.

00:06:33.225 --> 00:06:34.475

SHANE SMITH: All these kids,
they live in the market.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.840
They all live on the streets.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.750

OK.

So as we're hanging out and
watching them do their dancing

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.620
and stuff, we realize that all
these little boys are totally

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:23.670
addicted to sniffing glue.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.000
And do you sniff glue as well?

I'm not.

And everyone in the background
is saying, yeah you are.

I could smell it.

RAZAN AHMED: He knows, because
everyone's laughing at him.

00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:31.723
He's just trying to deny it.

SHANE SMITH: When you see kids,
it's always the heaviest

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.880
part, because they've
done nothing.

And whatever it is, land, or
greed, or any kind of--

it's usually money.

ramifications are, which are

in the street.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.500
We'd only been in Sudan a few
days, and we'd already seen

hundreds of displaced people,
and a lot of orphans, and the

to people and see what

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.070
they thought about what
was happening,

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.308
what was causing this.

SHANE SMITH: We're here at
a displaced persons camp.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.590
2 million people have been
displaced from the war on

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.600
Darfur, but also another
4 million from

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.710
the war in the South.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.010
They come to places like this
in the middle of the desert.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.970
A lot of the houses are made
from wattle and daub, from

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.090
manure, from hay, whatever
they can find.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.030
They estimate around 300,000
people live here.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.000
And we're going to tour around
and talk to people from the

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.240
South and from Darfur about
what they've done.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.130
It's just so makeshift.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.380
It's like Star Wars.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.300
Pretty heavy to be here.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.480
I was thinking about that last
night, how North America and

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.510
Europe, you get so used to
just booze, and food, and

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.960
coke, and parties,

water, food.

[SINGING SUDANESE SONG]

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:07.250
SHANE SMITH: We hear in America
that the conflict in

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:10.840
Darfur is racial in nature,
Arab on black.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.790
And when we were in the IDP
camp, there were Arabs, there

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:14.100
were blacks.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.400
There was actually 40 or 50
different tribes that all

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.020
co-exist and that
all get along.

00:13:21.966 --> 00:13:25.000
OLGA EUNICE ODERA: We
have so far about 56

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.270
tribes living here.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.190

OLGA EUNICE ODERA: And they
are from the 25 states.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.120
SHANE SMITH: And so we started
having some questions of, why

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.800
is this actually happening
in Darfur?

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.820
What's really happening?

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.390
So we started asking
the people if

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.610
they had any answers.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.310
Some people say it's racial.

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:42.760
Some people say it's economic.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.560
Some people say it's
political.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.960
People in the South
say one thing.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.020
People in Khartoum say
another thing.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.990
And I'm just trying to find out
what the general consensus

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:52.380
of why it's happening is.

00:13:56.086 --> 00:13:58.860
SHANE SMITH: We started hearing
a lot of rumors about

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.530
finding oil in Darfur.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:03.430
So we went into the camp to meet
some people from Darfur

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:04.970
and hear what their
stories were.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:06.950
We're going to our
friend's house.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:08.710
He's from Darfur.

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:11.690
He was just telling us that the
Janjaweed said, we want

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:13.580
you to go because
you're black.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:14.750
But they were the same color.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:18.210
And even in Khartoum the
Arabs are black.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:19.600
So he's saying, he's
not stupid.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.210
He understands that they're
just telling him that.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:24.610
But they want him to go for
another reason because they

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.050
want the land.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.790
SHANE SMITH: He had members of
his family, young babies,

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:52.280
thrown into fire.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.970
His father was killed.

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.070
His family was killed.

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.310
And he was kicked
out of his land.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:01.180
And what we were just talking
about after that was in the

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:04.960
South, we saw that the informal
militias started

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.710
coming when Chevron discovered
oil, kicking people off their

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:11.380
land, starting a 20
year civil war.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.320
And now what's happened is they
just found oil in Darfur.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.040
And a lot of people say
that the problem

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.610
in Darfur is racial.

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:19.280
But when we talked to a lot
of people, they say we

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.360
found oil in Darfur.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.150
And then it became much more
serious of a problem.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.020
They want the land.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.120
They want the land for cattle.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.490
They want the land for oil.

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:27.480
This is what's happening.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.900
And it already happened
in the South.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.770
Everybody here knows it.

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:33.500
But no one is reporting on
that for some reason.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:37.300
So after hearing about finding
oil in Darfur and hearing that

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.920
it was so similar to what had
already happened down South,

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.590
we decided to go to the Unity
State where they first found

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.580
oil and check out what
had happened there.

everything.

own UN plane.

They have oil.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.260
And this is where the
whole conflict

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:20.750
started because of oil.

goes, oh yeah, you'll see a

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.260
Russian helicopter.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.600
And they crash all the time
because they're really old.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.410
The Russians just give really
old helicopters.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.575
Sure enough, we got on this
Russian helicopter.

00:16:36.575 --> 00:16:38.990
And it's really old and
it's shaking around.

And we were going to Bentiu.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:44.345
Bentiu is in southern Sudan.

00:16:44.345 --> 00:16:47.180

in the middle of

nowhere, and we land.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.670

just see these really super

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:56.830

were the oil was found.

That's where the first well--
it's called the unity well--

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:16.349
was sunk.

And it was sunk by Chevron.

left during the war, and then

SHANE SMITH: They
found oil there.

00:17:34.695 --> 00:17:36.640
Then paramilitary groups
just started kicking

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.060
everybody off the land.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.100
They took the oil.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.040
It used to be Chevron.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.190
Now America's in disfavor.

So now it's all going
to Chinese

and Malaysian companies.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.710
So we're standing here
in front of one

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:48.650
of the unity wells.

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:51.370
A lot of people think in America
that the war here is

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:56.930
racial, between the Arab
population from the North and

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:59.620
the animist population
in the South.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.915
But the war started with the
finding the oil here.

00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:03.165
Is that true?

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.330
SHANE SMITH: They
take the oil.

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:29.100
SHANE SMITH: And they started
fighting to get--

00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:36.000
SHANE SMITH: '82, '83.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.110
We have to hurry.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.850
And we have to get out and in
very quickly, because the oil

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:41.970
security is very tight.

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:43.210
They don't want us shooting.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:44.590
They don't want anybody
to know.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.400
So we have to jump in, jump
out, jump in, jump out.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.700
And no one can see us, otherwise
we'd get in a lot of

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.220
trouble and go to jail.

00:19:04.396 --> 00:19:06.280

was terrified.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.630
If they catch you, that's it.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:09.120
So we get out of the
car, shoot it.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.490
This is the unity well.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:12.775
First thing, Chevron, in, out.

00:19:12.775 --> 00:19:14.820
When we have more time, we
went to the villages.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.006
And that's where it was really
sad, because you walk and

00:19:17.006 --> 00:19:18.420
there's just garbage
everywhere.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.870
We're here in Bentiu, which is
the capital of the Unity

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:26.670
State, which is the richest oil
concentration in Sudan.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:31.810
But as you can see, a lot of the
oil money, most of it goes

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.190
north or to China.

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.520
But very little of it
is coming here for

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.160
infrastructure, for
water, for roads.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.650
We're just checking it out with
our friend Charles who is

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.540
explaining to us the political
situation of what's happening.

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.910
SHANE SMITH: So most of the oil
in all of Sudan is from

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:52.830
the Unity State, but
it looks very poor.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.620
SHANE SMITH: So where does all
the money from the oil go?

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.050
SHANE SMITH: They don't
have water.

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:31.950
There's a huge malaria
epidemic.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:33.930
Anybody get any fish?

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.290
So the kids all come fish
in polluted water.

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:39.765
There's a lot of water-borne
diseases.

00:20:39.765 --> 00:20:43.080
They use popcorn, and they
have a little string.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.510
They try to get fish
out of here.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:49.640
The men get water
right from here.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:54.330
And then they just bring it with
a donkey to town and sell

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:58.300
it untreated, which of course
leads to a lot of disease.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.240
And you're like, hold on.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.610
You have a ton of oil.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.440
Shouldn't you have money?

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.200
All the money goes to China,
Malaysia, and Khartoum.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.570
They're supposed to get 2%.

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:07.530
But they don't have auditing.

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.090
So it's 2% of what?

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:34.740
SHANE SMITH: So they don't
get any money.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.470
And it's unbelievable poverty.

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.420
But right next to oil, right
next to these wells.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.765
And they won't even hire them
to work in the camps.

00:21:43.765 --> 00:21:47.680
They only bring in Chinese
and Malaysian workers.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:52.080
So we're just in the village,
and they don't have water.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.090
So they get just water untreated
from the river and

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:57.080
they sell it to the villagers,
which makes

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.650
everybody very sick.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:03.190
But even though right down the
street there's a brand new

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:05.190
petrol station for
all the trucks.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:09.070
The only roads are built for
the trucks to come get the

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:11.970
petrol, which just goes north.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.420
And you see, oh, they
found the oil.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:18.380
Paramilitary groups come in,
kill everybody, get them off

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.810
the land, take the oil.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.970
Now, OK, we've got the oil.

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:24.200
Now then people can come back.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:24.650
We don't care.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:25.610
It's ours.

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:27.490
Oh, find the oil in Darfur.

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:30.100
Send in the paramilitary groups,
kill everybody off,

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.410
take the oil.

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:32.630
They've been doing
it for 20 years.

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:47.789
[SUDANESE MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:47.789 --> 00:22:49.815
SHANE SMITH: We were driving
out to the pyramids.

00:22:49.815 --> 00:22:53.400
And as we were driving out,
there was a huge Chinese

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.530
refinery in the middle
of the desert.

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:58.240
Khartoum really doesn't want
you to know about oil.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.630
Because what happened was in the
South, Chevron found oil.

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:06.260
Right after that, paramilitary
groups came into the South and

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.570
started just exterminating
everybody.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:09.110
Why?

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.370
Because they wanted the oil.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:12.410
So there's a huge civil war.

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:13.960
Four million people
are killed.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.820
All the oil is going
to Khartoum.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:19.450
So the petrol profits are
going to Khartoum.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:20.540
And then they're
buying weapons.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:21.510
Why are they buying weapons?

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:23.800
Because they found
oil in Darfur.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.110
But this is what starts and
finishes the whole problem in

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:29.070
Darfur, the whole problem
in southern Sudan.

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:30.400
It's all about the oil.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.350
And this is where they
refine it right here.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:35.230
We're shooting literally for two
minutes in the middle of

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:35.940
the Sahara.

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.100
There's nothing near us.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:39.050
We're shooting this refinery.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:40.730
I'm saying, OK it's
all about oil.

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:41.530
The war's about oil.

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:42.440
Bang.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.920
Out of nowhere, this dude comes
screaming up, grabs the

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.440
camera right away, is about to
take us into jail, got a gun.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.600
Thank God we had a Ministry
of Information guy to

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.290
say, no, no, no.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:51.780
Wait, wait, wait.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.460
He took the camera back
from the guy.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.590
As they were arguing, we went
back into the truck and then

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:56.590
we just got out of there.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:59.160
RAZAN AHMED: Most of the time,
they break your camera first

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.780
and then they let you explain.

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.600
Other times, they don't just
break your camera, they break

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.570
your bones.

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:05.610
They beat you up.

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.351
We could've easily
gone to jail.

00:24:07.351 --> 00:24:08.692
We were very, very lucky.

00:24:08.692 --> 00:24:11.120
SHANE SMITH: When we finally got
to the pyramids, I was so

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.430
happy that I was giddy.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:13.200
I was giggling.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.250
I couldn't stop laughing.

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:16.340
I was nearly in tears
that we weren't

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:17.480
rotting in a pit somewhere.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.870
Because when they arrest you
in Sudan, you go to jail.

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.940
And you go to jail for life,
no trial, no nothing.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:28.400
We had to drive four hours
through the Sahara to get to

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.810
these pyramids and
nobody's here.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:33.720
Surprise, surprise.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.890
In Sudan, you're not allowed to
travel outside of Khartoum.

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:39.130
No one's been here for months.

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:43.040
So there's just us
and a camel guy.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:43.930
Yes, hello.

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:44.390
MALE SPEAKER 2: Hello.

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:45.580
SHANE SMITH: How are you?

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.560
[ARABIC].

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:53.038
These are the oldest pyramids
in the world apparently.

00:24:53.038 --> 00:24:55.960
Hold on, let me start again.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.130
It's really hard to
stay on up here.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:01.330
But these pyramids are older
than the pyramids in Egypt.

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.080
They're Nubian pyramids.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.970
And it shows the state of
affairs of tourism in Egypt

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:08.510
versus tourism in Sudan.

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:11.260
Because the pyramids in Egypt,
it's basically Disneyland.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.810
And here, as you can see,
there's absolutely nobody.

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:32.130
[SUDANESE MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:34.390
SHANE SMITH: We've been in Sudan
for about a week now.

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:38.540
And we've been afraid the whole
time about police, or

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.890
getting caught, or getting
our cameras smashed.

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:42.440
We couldn't really
eat anything.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.800
Water was hard to get,
clean water.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:45.960
We didn't sleep.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.300
Our doctors had warned us of
worms that fly out of the sand

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.090
into your eye.

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:53.020
We were worried about malaria.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:56.530
We couldn't get boners because
of our malaria pills.

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.650
We were just getting at
the end of our rope.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:25:59.420
And we're like, wait a minute.

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:01.760
We haven't even gotten close
to Darfur yet, where it was

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.640
really dangerous.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.180
So we're off to Darfur.

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:19.820
[SUDANESE MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.500
SHANE SMITH: Flying into Al
Fashir, which is the political

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.460
capital of Darfur, you see the
effects of the conflict

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.480
everywhere.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.660
First of all, we weren't even
allowed into Darfur.

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.300
They had made it illegal for any
foreign press to go there.

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.780
The airport was as far as
the UN could take us.

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:36.790
In fact, a National Geographic
journalist and his crew had

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:39.520
just been thrown in jail days
before for sneaking into

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.810
Darfur through Chad.

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:43.390
When we arrived in Al Fashir
proper, we weren't allowed to

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:44.250
shoot any footage.

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.630
Because it was not only illegal
to be there, but the

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:49.140
town was filled with Janjaweed,
Sudanese armed

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.220
forces, and SLA.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:54.080
The SLA are the rebel militia
headed by Minni Minnawi, who

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.090
we had just snuck into
Darfur to interview.

00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:00.750
We're here in the headquarters
of the SLF slash M to meet

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:02.620
Minna Minnawi, who is
now the fourth most

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:04.060
powerful man in Sudan.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.750
He was the main guy fighting
Janjaweed.

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:08.390
And the government has made a
peace agreement with him.

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:11.500
Minnawi, because he fought the
Janjaweed, is a hero to some.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.180
But others, like Amnesty
International, accuse him of

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:17.480
raping and killing civilians
as recently as last July.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.290
So as I was rushed in to
do the interview, I

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:20.720
sat across from him.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.525
I looked into his face.

00:27:21.525 --> 00:27:23.580
And it was totally,
totally fucked up.

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:24.530
And what do you think--

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:29.090
I know that Al Jazeera reported
that they found oil

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:31.100
in Darfur, which is
why there's a

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.210
lot of these problems.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:36.130
Because in the South, in the
Unity State, they found oil.

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:39.140
And then paramilitary groups
came to clear people out.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.160
And now maybe they found oil
in Darfur, and paramilitary

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.440
groups like the Janjaweed
are clearing people out.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.690
Do you know anything
about that?

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:23.310
SHANE SMITH: I don't have
a satellite myself.

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:25.260
And now that you're part of
the government, do you see

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:29.500
that helping the problem in
Darfur, political problem?

00:29:07.461 --> 00:29:10.555
SHANE SMITH: I went out back to
where Minnawi's troops were

00:29:10.555 --> 00:29:14.580
singing SLA songs and realized
that it was militia men just

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.950
like these who were responsible
for the Lost Boys,

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:21.600
for the refugees in the IDP
camps, for taking Rasheed's

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.980
two-month-old brother and
throwing him into a fire.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:28.167
And from what I've learned in
Southern Sudan and seen in Al

00:29:28.167 --> 00:29:31.040
Fashir, it looked to me like
this conflict is going to

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.000
continue as long as it is
profitable to do so.
