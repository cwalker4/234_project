00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.150
Well I'll tell you a couple of strange things that the things that I don't really understand the first is when we've done the analysis

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.449
Of the effects of the future authoring program it has had a different

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.660
It's differential impact on men and it's had a particularly

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:19.799
differential impact on what I would call excluded men, and so that would be non-western ethnic minority men or

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:21.820
or

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.050
What?

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.550
Majority, man who are doing very well so for example at Mohawk College

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.840
The future authoring program had a particularly robust effect on

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.319
Mohawk College students who were men who hadn't done very well in high school

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.259
And who hadn't picked a major that had a destination a career destination at its end

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.689
so you can imagine those people are they have an ambiguous relationship with the idea of education and

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.339
They're not oriented specifically towards a goal. They're not very motivated

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.749
Now why did it have a differential effect on men?

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.449
That's a good question

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.340
Well first of all the women are doing better

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.010
so

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.369
It might just be a matter of the fact that it does better for people who aren't doing as well and at the moment most

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.090
Of them are men

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.070
I don't believe I think that might be part of it, but I don't believe that's all of it

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.479
I think that part of the reason that women are doing better is cuz they're agreeable and

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.008
So if a system sets out a structure and says here's a pathway to attainment

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.599
The women won't rebel against that they'll go along with it and that's working very well for them at the moment

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.899
the men especially the men on the disagreeable end of the distribution

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.909
And there's way more men on the district disagreeable end of the distribution, then there are women right

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.809
That's what you get from if you look at overlapping normal distributions, so there's the male district female distribution for agreeableness

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.500
male distribution for agreeableness tremendous overlap

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.799
Okay, women are higher all the really agreeable people are women all the really disagreeable people are men

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:57.269
And maybe the real differences occur at the extremes right so so and it's it's a very interesting side effect of overlapping

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.850
Distributions, so they people can be mostly the same

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.229
But that can still produce

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.229
radical differences

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.540
Disagreeable men won't do anything they don't want to do

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.979
They just say up yours I'll go home and play video games

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.860
With you no. I'm not listening to your stupid and

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.249
Why should I work for you? I'll just go have fun

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.230
I'll do my own thing

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.989
I don't think they're motivated and so then if you take the men who are like that and you say, okay. What do you want?

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.880
You can have what you want

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.480
But you have to figure out what it is

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.509
So then they write down what they want they think oh hey well that might be worth having so maybe I'll put some effort into

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.939
It that's what it looks like to me now

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.809
You know that's weak evidence, and this is a weak argument, but I'm trying to stretch out my understanding to account for this

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.560
But I'll tell you something else that's really weird. I don't understand this either, so

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.810
More than 90% of the people who watch my videos on YouTube are men now

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:59.369
that's weird because not about 80% of psychology students are women so that is not what you would expect right you would expect that the

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.799
Majority of them would be women and you might say well

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.559
it's because of the political stance I've taken and I thought well that's possible so I went looked at the demographic data because I have

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.290
That well before I did any of the political videos

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.910
85% of my viewers were men so it's actually increased a bit, it's increased by 6% and that's not trivial

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.160
But it was still overwhelmingly men, so that was interesting. I thought what the hell

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.109
why is that exactly and then now I've been watching crowds when I've been talking to them and

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.480
The crowds that have come to see me in person this happened at the University of Toronto free speech debate

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.470
and I actually noticed it and

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.369
Commented on it before the debate took place because I was talking about intrinsic differences between men and women and I looked around the room

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.520
And I thought hmm hey 80% of the people in this room are men

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.330
So I had all the men's women and women stand up and then all the men stand up

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.059
I said look like here's a natural experiment

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.140
For some reason 80% of the people who showed up to this or men now everybody thought

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.169
I was kind of cracked to to do that and it was a risk

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.559
You know what and all right, but I thought no weather something going on here

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.940
And then what's interesting now is that every public appearance that I've made that's related to the sort of topics that we're discussing is

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.520
Overwhelmingly men it's like it's like

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:12.880
85 to 90%

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.839
And so I thought wow that's weird like what the hell's going on here exactly, and then the other thing. I've noticed is that?

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.369
I've been talking a lot to the crowds that I've been talking to not about rights

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:30.180
But about responsibility right because he can't have the bloody. What are you doing? You can't have the conversation about rights without the

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.140
conversation about responsibility because your rights are my

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.619
Responsibility that's what they are technically so you just can't have only half of that discussion

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.890
And we're only having half that discussion and the question is well

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:50.009
What the hell are you leaving out if you only have that half of the discussion and the answer is what you're leaving out

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.710
Responsibility and then the question is well

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.169
What are you leaving out if you're leaving out responsibility and the answer might be well, maybe you're leaving out the meaning of life

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.829
That's what it looks like to me. It's like here you are

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.999
Suffering away, what makes it worthwhile, right?

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.820
you know you're completely out you're completely you have no idea what you're

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.729
You it's almost impossible to describe how bad an idea that is

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.100
Responsibility

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.840
That's what gives life meaning

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.840
It's like lift a load

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.320
Then you can tolerate yourself right because look at your useless

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.309
Easily hurt easily killed. Why should you have any self-respect?

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.980
That's the story of the fall

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.809
Pick something up and carry it pick make it heavy enough so that you can think yeah well

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.489
Useless as I am at least I could move that from there to there well

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:51.150
What's really cool about that is that when I talk to these crowds about this the man's eyes light up, and that's very good

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.369
I've seen that phenomena because I've been talking about this mythological material for a long time and I can see when I'm watching crowds people

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:03.360
You know their eyebrows lift their eyes let light up because I put something together for them. That's what mythological stories

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.460
Do so I'm not taking responsibility for that

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.999
That's what the stories do so I save the story people go click click click

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.210
You know in their eyes light up, but this responsibility thing

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.589
That's a whole new order of this is that young men are so hungry for that it is unbelievable

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.219
And one of the things I've been talking to some of the people who've been

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.969
Running for the conservative leadership in Canada, and I've been talking to them about well the difficulties

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.220
They have communicating with young people because conservatives

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:34.830
What what the hell are they going to sell to young people right because being conservative is something that happens when you're older they can

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.830
sell responsibility

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.309
No, one's selling it and the thing is for men. There's nothing about responsibility

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:44.189
You know I was watching The Simpsons the other day

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:45.989
I watched the first Simpsons episode

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:51.689
And I deconstructed it and so it's really interesting so what happens in the first Simpson episode is that?

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:58.049
It's Christmas and homer and Marge are going to buy some Christmas presents, but Homer doesn't get his Christmas bonus

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.050
And so he's absolutely crushed by that and that

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:07.139
Actually is a recurring theme in The Simpsons where Homer loses his job or something like that or can tonight make enough money

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:10.438
He's completely crushed even though he's kind of useless bumbling

00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:17.429
Laughing fool of a guy. You know the thing that gives that show its soul is that he's still oriented towards his family

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:19.439
That's what makes him honorable is that?

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:22.528
Foolish as he is he's decided to adopt

00:07:22.929 --> 00:07:27.359
Responsibility for his family and to try to bear that and so he's not he's a holy fool

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.469
He's not a complete fool

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:35.939
And it's so interesting watching the story because he suffers dreadfully as a consequence of not being able to fulfill his responsibilities well

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:37.239
That's for men

00:07:37.239 --> 00:07:40.768
Women have their sets of responsibilities. They're not the same

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:45.449
Right because they're complicated because women of course have to take primary

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:52.378
Responsibility for for having infants at least but then also for caring for them there they're structured differently than men

00:07:53.259 --> 00:08:00.748
For biological necessity even if it's not a psychological issue and it's also partly a psychological issue women know what they have to do

00:08:01.209 --> 00:08:07.619
men have to figure out what they have to do, and if they have nothing worth living for then they stay Peter Pat and

00:08:08.289 --> 00:08:10.289
Why the hell not?

00:08:10.539 --> 00:08:14.818
because the alternative to valued responsibility is

00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:18.219
Impulsive

00:08:18.219 --> 00:08:19.329
low-class

00:08:19.329 --> 00:08:24.269
Pleasure and you saw that in the Pinocchio story right that's Pleasure Island, it's like well

00:08:24.369 --> 00:08:26.609
Why lift the load if there's nothing in it for you?

00:08:27.369 --> 00:08:31.828
That's another thing that we're doing to men. That's a very bad idea and to boys it's like

00:08:32.529 --> 00:08:36.479
You're pathological and oppressive. It's like fine. Then why the hell am I going to play

00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:40.438
That's that if that's the situation if I get no credit for bearing responsibility

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.349
It could bloody well be sure I'm not going to bear it

00:08:43.349 --> 00:08:49.739
but then you know your life is useless and meaningless and you have you're not you're full of self-contempt and nihilism and and

00:08:50.019 --> 00:08:52.948
That's not good, and so that's why I think all right

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:54.390
That's what I think's going

00:08:54.390 --> 00:09:00.269
At a deeper level with regards to men needing this direction a man has to decide that he's going to do something

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:06.659
He has to decide that yeah, well. You know partly what you're trying to do in the future authoring processes say, okay well

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.079
What's your highest value?

00:09:08.079 --> 00:09:14.969
Right it's the star. It's like. Okay. What are you aiming for you can decide man, but you know there's some criteria

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:20.550
It should be good for you. It should be good for you in a way that facilitates your moving forward

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:25.649
Maybe it should be good for you in a way. That's also good for the family in the community it should cover the the

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:34.350
domain of life I mean there's constraints on what you should regard as a value, but you but within those constraints you have the

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.319
Choice you have choice

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.749
Well the thing is is that people will carry a heavy load if they get to pick the goddamn load

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.140
So and they think well I won't carry any load

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.310
It's like okay fine

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.429
But then you're like the sled dog that doesn't have a sled to pull you're just gonna

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:57.269
You're gonna tear pieces out of your own legs because you're bored. You know you need people are pack animals

00:09:57.269 --> 00:10:02.279
They need they need to pull against a weight, and and that's not true for everyone

00:10:02.279 --> 00:10:08.729
it's not true particularly say for low conscientious people I mean maybe they're open and creative or extroverted and some other things but for the

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.040
for the typical person

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:18.209
They'll eat themselves they'll eat themselves up unless they have a load this is why there's such an opiate epidemic among

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:24.359
Dispossessed white middle-aged guys who are unemployed in the u.s.. It's like they lose their job. They're done

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:32.490
Right they despise themselves. They develop chronic pain syndromes and depression and the chronic pain is treated with opiates

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:34.490
It's like that's what we're doing so

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:41.699
Yeah, that's what it looks like to me is you you have to and it's so interesting to watch the young men when you talk

00:10:41.699 --> 00:10:49.439
To them about responsibility, there's a god damn thrilled about it. It just blows me away. It's like really. That's what's that's the counterculture

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.690
Grow the hell up and do something useful really I could do that oh

00:10:54.690 --> 00:11:01.169
I'm so excited by that idea no one ever mentioned that before it's like rights rights rights rights Jesus

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:08.940
It's it's it's appalling. It's a it's and and I feel that that's deeply felt by the people who are who are coming out to

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.509
To listen to these sorts of things - they're they've had enough of that

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:17.549
So and they better have because it's it's a non-productive mode of being

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.749
Responsibility man that's where the meeting in life is so
