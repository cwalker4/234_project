00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.629
Right You see you see how this works it's Just well here are Ways you can Be creative and here are strata of

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.009
Accomplishment Within Those Ways and so then The question is what Does it look like yes

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.910
yes

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.700
yes fair enough and and This probably Needs to be Updated to reflect That

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:29.398
So so there's There's the distribution of Scores Now That's Dismal That's a Dismal Thing

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:32.308
To look at you have to understand that Why look at this?

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:34.329
Zero

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.919
Right The median person has not done anything creative ever in Their life with anything on any Dimension

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.939
Right It's really important to know that and then You have These Horrible People out Here?

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:53.609
Right They do everything They do everything price is Law Here's prices Law This does something to hammer into your Heart?

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.479
The square root of The Number of People in a domain do 50% of the Work

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.430
Okay so let's Let's Go through That you have ten Employees three of them Do Half The Work

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.339
Makes sense That's reasonable you have a Hundred employees?

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.369
Ten of them Do Half the Work

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.149
That's problem so the Other Ninety Percent are doing the other Half Who cares about them you have ten Thousand employees a

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.580
Hundred of them Do Half the Work

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.780
Right So Here's That Here's a Nasty Little law As Your Company grows

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.849
incompetence Grows in It Exponentially and competence Grows Linearly

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.180
Got It right Because It with ten it's three who are doing half the Work but at ten Thousand it'S one Hundred that are doing

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.979
Half The Work so nine Thousand Nine Hundred of your employees are doing as much as The best 100

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.349
you Might Not even know who the best 100 are but probably they know and maybe Their Peers Know

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.479
Too and so One of The things That's Really interesting

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.080
When Big companies start to Shake Which means maybe They've had a Bad quarter too Bad quarters and the stock price starts to tip down

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.339
And The People the hot People who have options are not Very happy about that and

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.339
Maybe They start to announce layoffs all The Hundred People who have opportunities leave and They're the ones who were doing Half The Work?

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.019
So boy that puts your company in a Pretty Rough situation Because Now you've Got the ninety Nine Hundred

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.358
People Left Over Who we're only doing half the Work and the next time you announced layoffs the next most

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.309
Productive Hundred leave and so Then You're Left With Nobody Who's productive at a Massive

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.829
Overhead Payroll

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.129
Prices Law You can look that Up to soul a price to soul a price Is a Guy who was looking at scientific productivity and

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.609
One of The Things he found was When he was looking at Phd students is That

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:36.809
The Median Number of publications for a Phd graduate When he did his Work Which Was in the Early 60s Was one

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.950
okay half as Many Had - Half as Many as That had three Half as many as That had four it's a Real Step down

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.589
And One of The corollaries of that is that There's a Certain Number of People Who are hyper productive and That's These People Out Here?

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:57.298
and If You were graphing the distribution Let's Say You Graphed how many People in that Population of 300 had

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.360
$10,000 in a Savings account It Would Look Very Much Like This

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.880
Some of them would Have or

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.599
Some of some of them Would most People Would have like no Savings Whatsoever?

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.979
The Median person Would Have no savings Whatsoever and then You Go up here where the

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.209
1% is they have all the Money But the thing you want to understand about that 1%?

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.979
Issue that you always Hear about is that It applies in Every single Realm Where there's difference in creative production Every realm

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:31.019
Doesn't Matter Number of Records produce Number of Records sold Number of compositions Written so here's Here's an Example 5 composers

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:38.429
Produce The Music That occupies 50% of the Classical repertoire right bach Beethoven Brahms

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.329
Tchaikovsky

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.809
Who's Mozart That's right Those 5 ok so Here's something cool so you take all the Music Those People wrote

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.900
5% of the Music all Those People Wrote

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.829
occupies

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.819
50% of the Music that of Their writing That's Played

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.180
so not only

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.130
Do Almost all the composers never get a Listen But even among the composers who do get a Listen Almost none of Their Music ever

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.250
gets Played

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:10.139
So so then That's a That's another Example of This prices Loss Scaling so when It Applies to all sorts of Things Like Number of

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:14.549
Hockey Goals Scored Is also distributed This Way Number of Basketball Basketball

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:17.079
Basketball

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.529
Successfully Put Through The hoop Follows the same distribution

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:27.179
size of Cities Follows The Same distribution It'S a Weird it'S a Weird law and you can Think about it in part

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.800
Why Does this Happen

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.919
While imagine What happens when you play Monopoly

00:04:32.859 --> 00:04:36.479
What happens Everybody has the same Amount of Money to begin with right

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:39.719
so then You start Playing it's basically a Random Game

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:44.219
Well some People start to win a Bit and some People start to lose a Bit and then if you win the hut

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:48.509
probability That You'll keep Winning starts to increase and if you lose Your

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:54.449
Vulnerability Increases as You lose and then Maybe You've Got to say Six People Playing Monopoly Soon One person has zero

00:04:54.549 --> 00:04:56.549
What happens When they have zero?

00:04:57.429 --> 00:05:02.309
They're out of The game so zero Is a Weird Number Because When you hit zero you're out of the game so

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:08.458
So then if you keep Playing People start to stack up at zero Right What happens at the end of the game

00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:13.049
One person has all The property and all the Money and everyone else Has none

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:15.449
Right That's What happens if you Play an

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:22.319
Iterated trading Game to its Final Conclusion and That's Part of The the law in a sense That's Underlying This Kind of

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.518
Distribution so it's it's really it's it's it's not a consequence

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.899
NeCessarily Of Structural Inequality it's built into the system at a Deeper Level Than That

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:34.138
so you know People Talk about all The time about how Unfair it is That

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:40.408
1% of the population has the vast Amount of the Money and 1% of The 1% has most of That Money and

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:44.698
1% of The 1% of The 1% has most of That Money but It is a

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:51.958
It's a it's an inevitable conclusion of iterated trading Games and we Don't know how to fight it we don't know. How to take

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:57.508
From The People Who have and move it to the bottom Without Instantly moving back Up to the top

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:03.569
Different People Maybe But Still back Up to the top because even The 1% churns a Lot like i think

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:04.989
you have a

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:09.689
10% chance if i remember Correctly you have a 10% Chance of being in The top 1%

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:12.719
for At Least One Year of Your life and a

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:13.569
40%

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:15.339
Chance of being in The top 10%

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:19.379
For At Least One Year in Your life That's in canada in the us it's less so in europe

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:24.779
So there's a Fair Bit of Churning at The top end it's not the same people all the time who have the Money

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:28.528
But It is a Tiny Fraction of The People all the time who have all the Money

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.060
yeah

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.610
No

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.610
Not usually i

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.740
Mean They do but it's attenuated

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.140
Because The People Mean

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.089
If you Reshuffle the entire company and Put everywhere somewhere Else There's some

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.850
Probability That some of Those People Would rise to the top that Weren't

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:02.570
At the top before but in that Company that that isn't Generally What happens People Get stuck in their niche and they don't move so

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.910
yeah This is you cool you wonder sometimes well how can Companies die so quickly

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.049
Well They go they go into a Death Spiral That's almost impossible for them to get out of

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:19.429
so and It Happened It can Happen Extraordinarily Quickly This is why you know the typical fortune 500 company only lasts 30 Years That's it

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.390
It's not That Easy for These bam moths to continued Existence across Time

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:28.609
So and it's because it's really easy for something to die it's very Unlikely that it Will be built

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:36.260
It's very Unlikely That It Will Be Successful and Once Successful it's Very Unlikely that It Will continue to duplicate its success because the Underlying

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:41.239
Landscape Shifts on It and It Doesn't Know where to go and That's also partly Because

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.590
It's not That Easy to integrate

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:49.520
Creative People Into your Company right You Certainly don't want them at the bottom Because They're supposed to be people who are doing What they're

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.190
Told to do

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:55.130
So you filter Out a Lot of them at the bottom and then you need them at the top but They've already Been Filtered out

00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:01.219
and also creative People are troublesome to work with because They're always how do You evaluate a creative person

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.740
You all you almost can't By

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.730
Definition Because They keep coming Up with New Things and you don't have a Good

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:11.209
Evaluative Strategy for a New Thing It Wouldn't be new if you had a Good

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:15.440
Evaluative Strategy for It right It Would have to be the member of a Class That You've Already encountered

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:19.460
Substantially so Anyway so the take-Home lesson from this is?

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:22.770
Zero

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:29.869
Right Right and Then That's Like That's like a Graph of Money Monetary distribution as Well and The Thing the problem with being at zero

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.010
Is it very difficult to get out of zero This is also Why People Get stuck in

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:38.718
Poverty You Know you can't get a bank account if you're if you don't have any Money Right if

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.369
There's a Bunch of Things That start to move against you when you're at zero that you can't

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.640
Shake it's very difficult to get out of the out of the

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.539
The Pit here because zero Is a Kind of Pit
