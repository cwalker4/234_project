00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:07.209
Starch!

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:09.480
(Laughter)

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.910
Yeah, it’s starch.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.919
You know, rice, corn,
potatoes, sweet potatoes.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.085
It’s starch that has healed 
thousands of my patients.

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:22.275
For example,

00:00:22.405 --> 00:00:23.849
a young lady from the Bay Area

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.539
had deforming rheumatoid arthritis,

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.729
to the point where
she couldn’t catch her mom.

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.963
Juliea Baker decided, at 17 years old, 
she was going to change her diet.

00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:38.248
She was going to give up the cheese,
the meat, and the oil;

00:00:38.918 --> 00:00:42.375
and switch to a diet 
based upon rice, corn, and potatoes.

00:00:43.112 --> 00:00:46.332
And it took about seven days 
before she started getting better.

00:00:47.382 --> 00:00:49.479
Or, from Sacramento, Robert Cross.

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:52.349
he used to work in the attorney
general’s office.

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:54.309
He had terrible chest pains;

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:58.985
high blood pressure, diabetes, 
high cholesterol, overweight.

00:00:59.675 --> 00:01:01.439
He went to his doctor for a solution.

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:03.959
Quickly ended up 
in front of the cardiologist,

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:05.336
who recommended what?

00:01:05.886 --> 00:01:06.886
A heart surgery.

00:01:06.886 --> 00:01:09.000
He said, "No. I’ve got a better idea".

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.779
And he switched to a starch-based diet.

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.959
He lost 60 pounds, dropped
his cholesterol from 300 to 150,

00:01:16.557 --> 00:01:17.947
and cleaned out his arteries.

00:01:18.917 --> 00:01:21.352
Or Deb Tasic, from Chicago.

00:01:21.862 --> 00:01:23.659
He had terrible Multiple Sclerosis.

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.783
In fact, she fell down, stayed down 
for a month, couldn’t get up.

00:01:27.393 --> 00:01:30.202
Her doctor told her she’d be
in a wheelchair in five years,

00:01:30.202 --> 00:01:32.172
and likely bedridden or dead in 10.

00:01:32.172 --> 00:01:33.925
She said, I’m not going to do that.

00:01:34.155 --> 00:01:37.495
So what she did is, 
she switched to starch.

00:01:37.495 --> 00:01:38.759
Yeah, starch.

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:40.967
I’m doctor John MacDougall.

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.557
I’ve been in this business for 44 years.

00:01:45.187 --> 00:01:49.096
And I’m the luckiest doctor in the world
because my patients get well.

00:01:50.576 --> 00:01:51.476
It started out...

00:01:51.476 --> 00:01:53.796
(Applause)

00:01:54.476 --> 00:01:57.596
I have to tell you, it started out 
by a bit of an accident.

00:01:57.896 --> 00:01:59.058
I was in Michigan,

00:02:00.628 --> 00:02:05.856
and decided to go to Hawaii
for my internship, back in 1972.

00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:08.305
I stayed in Oahu for a year,

00:02:08.305 --> 00:02:14.095
practiced just general internal medicine 
or internship type of program.

00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:15.383
And then after a year,

00:02:15.383 --> 00:02:17.825
I fell in love with Hawaii
and didn’t want to leave.

00:02:17.865 --> 00:02:21.091
So, I took a job on the Big Island 
as a plantation doctor.

00:02:21.521 --> 00:02:24.171
And there I worked
as a general doctor for three years.

00:02:24.171 --> 00:02:26.849
I caught babies, 
I pronounced people dead,

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:29.440
I did brain surgery 
in the middle of the night.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.709
But I’ve learned everything 
that I know today

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.434
during those three years
from my patients.

00:02:34.984 --> 00:02:37.934
First thing I learned was 
that I wasn’t a very good doctor.

00:02:38.564 --> 00:02:41.343
I thought I was going to make 
all these miraculous cures.

00:02:41.343 --> 00:02:45.759
I mean, I watched Ben Casey, 
Dr. Kildare, Marcus Welby.

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:47.204
I knew what a real doctor did.

00:02:47.204 --> 00:02:50.341
And I went into this general practice 
on the Big Island of Hawaii,

00:02:50.861 --> 00:02:54.734
And I started taking care of these 5000 
sugar plantation patients.

00:02:55.164 --> 00:02:57.719
And I gave them 
the best pills I could find,

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.309
I sent them off to the best
surgeons in Honolulu.

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.196
And they wouldn’t get well.

00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:06.422
They just stayed fat and sick.

00:03:06.482 --> 00:03:09.542
Initially, I thought it was 
because I was a bad doctor.

00:03:11.352 --> 00:03:15.379
I realized my limitations as a physician 
during those three years;

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:16.421
I was humbled.

00:03:18.301 --> 00:03:20.631
The second thing that I learned 
from my patients,

00:03:20.631 --> 00:03:23.010
It was a unique setting
on the Big Island of Hawaii,

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.250
in the sugar plantation,

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.431
is I learned how to eat.

00:03:25.431 --> 00:03:28.858
because I was taking care 
of 5,000 people who ate differently.

00:03:29.398 --> 00:03:33.279
I was taking care of first, second,
third, and fourth generation

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:36.090
of Filipinos, Japanese, 
Chinese, and Koreans.

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:39.279
Now, my first generation, 
they learned about how to eat

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:41.529
when they’re little kids 
in their native land:

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:44.069
the Philippines, Japan, China, Korea.

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.429
They learned a diet 
of rice and vegetables.

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.279
Then, they had the fortune 
of moving to the Big Island,

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:52.278
to start new families, a new life, 

00:03:52.478 --> 00:03:54.658
but with them they took 
their original diet.

00:03:54.658 --> 00:03:56.979
And they continued to eat 
rice and vegetables.

00:03:57.619 --> 00:04:00.939
The kids, who were influenced 
a little bit by the western diet,

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.909
started to change.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.029
And by the time you got to the grand-kids,

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.098
you’re looking at people who ate 
the traditional western diet.

00:04:09.288 --> 00:04:11.719
Now, realize these are people 
of the same genetics,

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:15.784
same kind of work for over 100 years
on the sugar plantation

00:04:16.304 --> 00:04:21.534
Yet, before my eyes as a doctor,
I saw people living on rice and vegetables

00:04:21.534 --> 00:04:24.802
No dairy, just a little bit
of meat at most.

00:04:24.802 --> 00:04:26.279
Trim, healthy, hardy people.

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:31.092
No MS, no arthritis, no diabetes, 
no heart disease

00:04:31.092 --> 00:04:34.077
in that first generation living
on those traditional diets.

00:04:34.697 --> 00:04:37.633
Then, I watched the second generation
get fatter and sicker

00:04:37.633 --> 00:04:39.072
as they abandoned starch.

00:04:40.392 --> 00:04:42.021
And then, the third generation,

00:04:42.441 --> 00:04:44.141
which feared starch,

00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:46.259
- rice, corn, potatoes -

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:51.050
and took on meat and dairy 
in their diet, and oils.

00:04:51.005 --> 00:04:54.102
They got fat and sick just like 
every other American.

00:04:55.022 --> 00:04:58.965
Well, after three years, I had to leave
as a general practitioner.

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:02.710
I went back to Oahu to become
a board-certified internist.

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.409
And I spent the next two years

00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:09.699
studying in the scientific library,
in the Medical Library,

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.429
next to Queen’s Medical Centre,

00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:14.307
to see whether anybody else 
had made this observation:

00:05:14.717 --> 00:05:17.199
that people who live on starch

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.259
- rice, corn, potatoes, sweet potatoes -

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.847
are thin, healthy, hardy, young-looking.

00:05:23.547 --> 00:05:26.274
Not just in the world today, 
but throughout history.

00:05:26.274 --> 00:05:28.964
And when they switch
to a well-balanced diet,

00:05:29.414 --> 00:05:30.954
the rich American diet,

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.519
with lots of protein, calcium 
and other of these wonderful nutrients,

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:36.879
do they get fat and sick?

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:40.553
What I found out was that scientists
over the previous 100 years

00:05:40.553 --> 00:05:41.845
had made this observation.

00:05:42.095 --> 00:05:44.179
In fact, it goes further back than that.

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:48.409
That was important, because that 
told me right there and then,

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:52.668
that getting older didn’t mean getting fat
and sick; it didn’t have to be that way.

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:54.555
But as I read in the science, 

00:05:54.555 --> 00:05:56.865
I discovered something
that was really profound,

00:05:56.865 --> 00:05:59.564
and I’m sure it’s going to be easy
for you to understand.

00:05:59.874 --> 00:06:04.011
When you stop doing things
that make people sick, they get well.

00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:08.034
And so, if I had figured out

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:12.246
that eating a well-balanced diet,
lots of meat and dairy made people sick,

00:06:13.716 --> 00:06:17.619
then the only next clue I needed
was the idea that I could be

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:19.448
a miracle doctor.

00:06:19.448 --> 00:06:22.638
I could fulfill what I wanted
to do as a physician,

00:06:22.695 --> 00:06:26.808
which is to help other people
by applying this very simple principle.

00:06:28.218 --> 00:06:32.369
That is, to feed people a diet
for human beings.

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:35.009
You know, there is a diet for people.

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:36.786
I know you might be surprised

00:06:36.786 --> 00:06:38.984
considering the variety
of what everybody eats.

00:06:38.984 --> 00:06:40.874
But there is a diet for human beings.

00:06:40.874 --> 00:06:43.298
Each of you ought to be able
to answer that question

00:06:43.298 --> 00:06:45.627
for yourself, for your spouses,

00:06:45.627 --> 00:06:47.976
for your children, for your friends.

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:50.361
You should be able to have that answer.

00:06:50.361 --> 00:06:52.611
When someone says, 
"What do humans eat?"

00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:55.019
I mean after all you know 
what a cat eats, right?

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:57.758
You know cats are carnivores.

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:03.880
Horses, they have a diet, 
and parrots have a diet,

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:09.059
You never take and feed your parrot meat 
or your cat nuts and seeds.

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:12.459
So every animal must have a diet.

00:07:12.459 --> 00:07:14.679
What is the diet for human beings?

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:17.509
History will tell us what that is.

00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:23.029
When you look back through history,
you can go back 2.5 million years,

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:28.119
and you see that the bulk of human beings

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:30.844
have lived on starch-based diets.

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:36.089
We have evidence from 44,000 years ago

00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:40.177
that said that the Neanderthals
lived on starches.

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:44.309
And from 30,000 years ago, we have
population studies in Europe,

00:07:45.119 --> 00:07:48.004
that talk about people living
on starch-based diets.

00:07:49.234 --> 00:07:52.057
I mean, that’s pre-agriculture,

00:07:52.227 --> 00:07:53.327
so they say.

00:07:54.197 --> 00:07:56.563
That’s pre-civilization, so they say.

00:07:56.563 --> 00:08:00.305
But how about over the last 
10, 12, 14, 000 years?

00:08:00.325 --> 00:08:02.109
We have really direct evidence, 

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:06.989
we have written evidence
about what people ate.

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:10.100
And if you’re a person of history,
you know what people ate.

00:08:11.466 --> 00:08:16.399
Throughout human history, all large,
successful populations of people,

00:08:17.979 --> 00:08:20.559
have obtained the bulk 
of their calories from starch.

00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:24.948
I’m sure lots of examples 
are popping in your mind.

00:08:24.948 --> 00:08:28.635
You’re thinking about 
the Aztecs and Mayans;

00:08:28.915 --> 00:08:31.823
the people of the corn.

00:08:32.773 --> 00:08:34.789
And if you go a little bit further south,

00:08:35.569 --> 00:08:37.948
and you look at the Incas;
they lived on potatoes.

00:08:37.948 --> 00:08:40.786
Except when they went to battle
then they'd switch to quinoa

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:42.364
And if you go to the Middle East,

00:08:42.364 --> 00:08:44.879
these people are from
the bread baskets of the world.

00:08:47.359 --> 00:08:51.249
In Asia, I think most people can relate
to the rice-based diets.

00:08:51.249 --> 00:08:52.816
And think about these people.

00:08:54.416 --> 00:08:59.922
Trim, hardy, healthy, strong warriors.

00:09:00.382 --> 00:09:03.839
The diet of human beings has been
traditionally and always will be a diet

00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:06.597
based on starch with the addition
of fruits and vegetables.

00:09:06.867 --> 00:09:12.216
What happened is people became
more effective at gathering calories.

00:09:13.116 --> 00:09:16.907
And the richer people in every society,
what happened to them is

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:20.062
they no longer had to eat the starches.

00:09:20.572 --> 00:09:25.006
They can instead eat the animals
that were eating the starches.

00:09:25.576 --> 00:09:26.976
And as a result,

00:09:27.106 --> 00:09:30.563
there's a certain segment of population
throughout all of human history

00:09:30.952 --> 00:09:33.559
that became wealthier
than the rest of the people.

00:09:35.139 --> 00:09:39.019
And these people could eat meat, pheasant,

00:09:39.259 --> 00:09:41.632
or pigs, or other kinds of animals,

00:09:41.972 --> 00:09:43.911
and put the starches as side dishes.

00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:46.481
We had the pharaohs, the kings,

00:09:46.481 --> 00:09:51.172
the priests and the priestesses of 3,500
years ago who were described as fat.

00:09:52.492 --> 00:09:56.089
The examination of their bodies, 
3,500 years later, shows

00:09:56.089 --> 00:09:58.552
terrible atherosclerosis, 
gallbladder disease,

00:09:58.552 --> 00:10:01.709
and all kinds of other problems
of Western civilization.

00:10:02.469 --> 00:10:04.738
Well, we had few kings 
and queens back then.

00:10:05.738 --> 00:10:08.087
And then, as time went on, 
more and more people

00:10:08.467 --> 00:10:10.397
were able to eat like kings and queens.

00:10:10.397 --> 00:10:12.508
You recall King Henry 8th and his court.

00:10:13.168 --> 00:10:14.328
What did they look like?

00:10:15.498 --> 00:10:16.483
Americans.

00:10:16.703 --> 00:10:18.133
That’s what they looked like.

00:10:18.183 --> 00:10:22.222
And then, as time went on, we became
more efficient at gathering food.

00:10:22.652 --> 00:10:23.840
People became wealthier.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.924
We had the industrial revolution
in its midst of 150 years ago.

00:10:27.164 --> 00:10:29.311
And we had the discovery of fossil fuel

00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:30.864
And as a consequence, 

00:10:31.744 --> 00:10:34.834
almost everybody in western society
can eat like kings and queens.

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:36.137
And what's the result?

00:10:37.377 --> 00:10:38.450
Can’t you see it?!

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:39.565
Can’t you see it? 

00:10:39.985 --> 00:10:42.265
When people abandon
their starch-based diets

00:10:42.265 --> 00:10:44.206
of rice and corn and potatoes,

00:10:44.346 --> 00:10:46.345
with the addition
of fruits and vegetables;

00:10:46.345 --> 00:10:50.165
instead, they eat the food of royalty,
as people do in western society,

00:10:50.225 --> 00:10:51.459
what would you expect?!

00:10:51.459 --> 00:10:55.359
That you’d have people that look like
kings and queens, and are sick

00:10:55.359 --> 00:10:59.653
with diabetes, and heart disease,
and cancer, and multiple sclerosis.

00:11:00.163 --> 00:11:02.511
Anyway, that’s the setting
of the country today.

00:11:02.511 --> 00:11:05.426
The statistics are very familiar 
to you, I’m sure.

00:11:06.296 --> 00:11:09.029
We live in a society where
people are fat and sick.

00:11:09.799 --> 00:11:12.719
Not just the adults, 
but the children too.

00:11:14.359 --> 00:11:16.435
30% of the kids are overweight.

00:11:17.975 --> 00:11:19.352
Not only they're overweight;

00:11:19.352 --> 00:11:22.252
but deep under the skin,
there’s a lot of sickness.

00:11:22.812 --> 00:11:25.209
These kids have atherosclerosis;

00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:27.399
they have arthritis;

00:11:28.319 --> 00:11:30.074
they suffer precocious puberty.

00:11:30.724 --> 00:11:34.459
Little boys are going through 
puberty at the age of nine,

00:11:34.649 --> 00:11:37.001
little girls around age eight.

00:11:37.001 --> 00:11:39.311
That’s five-six years before intended.

00:11:40.001 --> 00:11:42.270
We have a society of sick children.

00:11:44.439 --> 00:11:45.575
Now, come on.

00:11:46.245 --> 00:11:49.235
Civilized people don’t let 
children be hurt.

00:11:50.305 --> 00:11:52.068
But somehow we do in our society.

00:11:52.068 --> 00:11:54.065
Somehow it’s okay 
for the kids to be sick.

00:11:55.015 --> 00:11:56.015
Well, it’s not okay.

00:11:57.495 --> 00:12:01.248
People should rise up to the occasion 
and protect their children,

00:12:01.998 --> 00:12:03.379
How about our soldiers?

00:12:04.489 --> 00:12:06.139
Our soldiers are sick.

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:10.496
We send our men and women
across the world to represent us,

00:12:12.224 --> 00:12:13.969
Yet, half of the soldiers

00:12:15.259 --> 00:12:16.207
are overweight.

00:12:16.207 --> 00:12:20.059
And underneath that obesity
there’s a lot of sickness. 

00:12:20.169 --> 00:12:24.429
What kind of society tolerates men 
and women who fight in our defense,

00:12:24.739 --> 00:12:25.939
tolerates them being ill?

00:12:26.459 --> 00:12:29.721
Because the rich western diet 
feeds them a diet of kings and queens.

00:12:29.751 --> 00:12:31.159
Makes no sense at all.

00:12:32.509 --> 00:12:33.879
How about our businesses?

00:12:33.939 --> 00:12:35.979
We are competing in a world market

00:12:35.979 --> 00:12:38.299
and our workers are fat and sick?!

00:12:39.629 --> 00:12:43.579
How do we compete with people in Japan
who live on a starch-based diet?

00:12:43.579 --> 00:12:45.403
or China, or India?

00:12:45.403 --> 00:12:48.713
Oh, I know how; we just wait untill
they switch to the american diet

00:12:48.713 --> 00:12:50.288
and get fat and sick, right?

00:12:51.378 --> 00:12:52.928
I think there is a better way.

00:12:53.198 --> 00:12:57.591
We can work hard to get 
our employees healthy.

00:12:57.691 --> 00:12:59.459
How about our health care system,

00:12:59.459 --> 00:13:05.179
where 20% of our gross national product 
is expected to be spent on illness?

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:06.952
How can we ever get ahead?

00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:08.803
How can we solve the deficit?

00:13:09.383 --> 00:13:11.066
How could we fix this world?

00:13:12.956 --> 00:13:17.154
When we have a world where 
people look, feel and function

00:13:17.154 --> 00:13:18.639
like kings and queens?

00:13:21.339 --> 00:13:26.168
The solution is simple,
but it doesn’t favor business.

00:13:27.679 --> 00:13:29.749
We have a celebration here.

00:13:30.689 --> 00:13:31.689
George McGovern.

00:13:33.169 --> 00:13:36.097
Senator George McGovern
died last month.

00:13:36.097 --> 00:13:38.999
October 21st, 2012.

00:13:39.429 --> 00:13:42.809
George McGovern was essentially 
the author of dietary goals

00:13:42.809 --> 00:13:43.959
of the United States,

00:13:44.289 --> 00:13:47.668
which were published in January 1977.

00:13:48.148 --> 00:13:53.645
These goals were to be similar
to the Surgeon General’s Report of 1964.

00:13:54.455 --> 00:13:56.864
The Surgeon General’s Report of 1964

00:13:56.864 --> 00:13:58.644
changed America.

00:13:59.104 --> 00:14:00.581
It changed the Western world.

00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:03.898
Back then, in the 70s,,
half of the population smoked.

00:14:04.118 --> 00:14:06.626
Today, fewer than 20% of the people smoke.

00:14:08.031 --> 00:14:10.012
Back in the 70s,

00:14:10.702 --> 00:14:13.618
obesity was half of what it is today;

00:14:14.638 --> 00:14:17.189
diabetes was half what it is today.

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:18.879
Industry has won.

00:14:19.429 --> 00:14:21.189
Americans have lost.

00:14:22.109 --> 00:14:23.939
But we have an option to change that.

00:14:24.079 --> 00:14:27.355
By becoming informed
about what the human being eats.

00:14:27.735 --> 00:14:29.375
The human being is a starch eater.

00:14:29.845 --> 00:14:33.136
All of you out there that are suffering, 
your families are suffering.

00:14:33.486 --> 00:14:36.239
and you’re looking to modern
medicine for a solution;

00:14:36.369 --> 00:14:37.269
stop looking.

00:14:37.979 --> 00:14:41.609
They’re not going to cure dietary
diseases with a pill or a surgery.

00:14:42.229 --> 00:14:46.049
You’re going to fix dietary diseases
by fixing the problem,

00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:48.730
which is the food.

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:53.439
And when you fix the food, 
what happens is people get healthy.

00:14:53.839 --> 00:14:56.654
You as individuals,
sick with various diseases,

00:14:57.194 --> 00:15:00.439
communities, countries, and the world,

00:15:00.979 --> 00:15:03.430
can get healthy by making 
a simple change,

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.503
back to a starch-based diet.

00:15:05.503 --> 00:15:08.833
And I believe it will make economic sense
to have a healthy country.

00:15:09.433 --> 00:15:11.532
I believe it’s worth doing.

00:15:12.332 --> 00:15:14.858
I know a lot of you who are new to this;

00:15:15.668 --> 00:15:17.462
you think about changing your diet,

00:15:19.202 --> 00:15:22.072
and somebody says to you, 
"Well, you have to give up meat,

00:15:24.222 --> 00:15:25.489
you have to give up dairy,

00:15:25.489 --> 00:15:29.437
your ice cream, your cheese,
your chicken, your steaks".

00:15:30.477 --> 00:15:36.221
You say, "I’m going to starve to death;
its like asking me to give up breathing,

00:15:36.641 --> 00:15:39.816
or asking me to give up drinking water".

00:15:41.446 --> 00:15:43.355
You think it’s impossible task.

00:15:43.905 --> 00:15:47.439
That’s because you’ve been
faced with a serious untruth

00:15:47.729 --> 00:15:49.129
about starches.

00:15:49.889 --> 00:15:51.549
You love starch;
I know you do.

00:15:52.489 --> 00:15:54.945
When I mention rice and beans,

00:15:56.175 --> 00:15:57.805
you have a very positive reaction.

00:15:58.445 --> 00:15:59.660
If I mention pasta,

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.615
you say, "Well, that’s comfort food".

00:16:01.945 --> 00:16:03.952
Potatoes, "I was raised in the Midwest;

00:16:03.952 --> 00:16:06.786
If it wasn’t for mashed potatoes,
I wouldn’t be here today".

00:16:10.036 --> 00:16:13.319
So when somebody says,
"You must give up meat and dairy",

00:16:15.159 --> 00:16:17.303
and they fail to finish the sentence,

00:16:17.703 --> 00:16:20.003
What you need to do instead is,

00:16:20.003 --> 00:16:22.669
you need to live on starch.

00:16:22.769 --> 00:16:25.179
on oatmeal for breakfast, 
hash brown potatoes;

00:16:25.449 --> 00:16:28.277
for lunch you need to have
bean soup, pea soup, lentil soup;

00:16:28.277 --> 00:16:31.139
for dinner you have bean burritos,
pasta with marinara sauce,

00:16:31.139 --> 00:16:32.597
mu-shu vegetables and rice.

00:16:32.597 --> 00:16:34.811
You say, "I can do that!"

00:16:34.811 --> 00:16:36.861
Of course you can, you love those foods.

00:16:37.791 --> 00:16:40.639
This is the kind
of education that we need.

00:16:41.079 --> 00:16:44.377
We need new dietary goals 
for the United States.

00:16:44.597 --> 00:16:48.065
We need a government that will stand up
and tell the truth to the people.

00:16:48.285 --> 00:16:51.164
We need a society that will not tolerate

00:16:51.164 --> 00:16:54.774
uncivilized behavior like letting
our children be sick,

00:16:54.774 --> 00:16:56.469
our military be sick,

00:16:56.469 --> 00:16:59.349
our poor people be sick,
and our workers be sick

00:16:59.349 --> 00:17:02.945
because of the diet of kings and queens.

00:17:03.315 --> 00:17:05.551
And once we do that,
we can change it, can't we?

00:17:05.851 --> 00:17:07.231
We can make a difference.

00:17:08.121 --> 00:17:09.403
Thank you very much!

00:17:09.403 --> 00:17:12.053
(Applause)
