BACK THEN THEY COULD REPEAL. I WATCHED TODAY IN AWE AS

00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:15.098 line:92%
SENATOR AFTER SENATOR GOT UP TO SAY, I WILL ONLY ROTE FOR THE

00:00:15.233 --> 00:00:18.765 line:92%
WILL IN FRONT OF THIS AUGUST BODY IF YOU GUARANTEE AND ASSURE

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:22.198 line:92%
ME, IT DOES NOT BECOME LAW. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THAT BEFORE?

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:30.965 line:92%
&gt;&gt; I WAS JUST THINKING, CHRIS. CONGRESS HAS A 12% POSITIVE

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.298 line:92%
RATING. I THINK WE'LL BE IN LOW SINGLE

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:41.998 line:92%
DIGITS AFTER THIS ABOMINATION. WE HAVE THIS SITUATION AS YOU'VE

00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:45.265 line:92%
INDICATED, REPUBLICAN MEMBERS HAVE SAID, THIS IS A FRAUD, A

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.565 line:92%
DISASTER. OH, YEAH, WE M MAY VOTE FOR IT

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.732 line:92%
IT GOES TO CONFERENCE. THEN ON THE HOUSE SIDE, YOU'VE

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:59.165 line:92%
HAVING ON THE HOUSE SIDE, RYAN SAYING, ACTUALLY, IT MAY GO TO

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:09.765 line:92%
THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. THIS WOULD RAISE PREMIUMS.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.465 line:92%
THE CBO, CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:21.132 line:92%
20% THIS YEAR, 20% ON TOP OF THAT, AND 20% ON TOP OF THAT.

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:24.199 line:92%
IN OTHER WORDS, PREMIUMS WILL SOAR IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:27.065 line:92%
16 MILLION PEOPLE WILL LOSE THEIR INSURANCE.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.198 line:92%
PLANNED PARENTHOOD WILL BE DEFUNDED.

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:36.698 line:92%
IT MAY BE PATHETIC BUT THIS IS NOT A LAUGHING MATTER.

00:01:36.833 --> 00:01:40.732 line:92%
&gt;&gt; AND WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS ESSENTIALLY UNIFORMLY UNDERSTOOD

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:44.765 line:92%
BY THE ACTUAL PARTICIPANT. WHAT THEY GOT UP THERE TO SAY

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:54.598 line:92%
WAS, THIS IS A DISASTER. THIS IS UNWORKABLE POLICY.

00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:58.232 line:92%
PAUL RYAN BASICALLY SAYS HE DOESN'T OFFER THE ASSURANCE.

00:01:58.333 --> 00:02:03.932 line:92%
HE DOESN'T SAY UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:06.998 line:92%
HE SAYS, IF YOU NEED US TO, WE WILL.

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:10.698 line:92%
ARE THEY GOING TO ALLOW US TO BE CONNED IN DAYLIGHT?

00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:19.398 line:92%
&gt;&gt; WHAT I WOULD SAY IS STAY TUNED.

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:21.798 line:92%
I'LL TELL WHAT YOU THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT.

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:26.065 line:92%
THEY UNDERSTAND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS FAR FROM PERFECT.

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.032 line:92%
DEDUCTIBLES ARE TOO HIGH. CO-PAYMENTS ARE TOO HIGH,

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:32.299 line:92%
PREMIUMS ARE TOO HIGH AND WE PAY THE HIGHEST PRICES IN THE WORLD

00:02:32.433 --> 00:02:34.932 line:92%
FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND THEY ARE SOARING EVERY SINGLE DAY.

00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:38.799 line:92%
WHAT VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT IS FOR A

00:02:38.933 --> 00:02:45.932 line:92%
START FOR US TO IMPROVE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:51.132 line:92%
LOWER PREMIUMS, LOWER CO-PAYMENTS, LOWER PRESCRIPTION

00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:52.465 line:92%
DRUGS. I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO GO FURTHER

00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:59.865 line:92%
AND PASS A MEDICARE FOR ALL SINGLE PAYER PERHAPS WILL.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.898 line:92%
RIGHT NOW, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT TO US APPROVE THE

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:07.665 line:92%
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THERE HAS NOT BEEN ONE PUBLIC

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.365 line:92%
HEARING. NOT ONE DOCTOR HAS BEEN ABLE TO

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:12.632 line:92%
TESTIFY IN COMMITTEE ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE LEGISLATION ON HIS

00:03:12.766 --> 00:03:16.698 line:92%
OR HER PATIENTS. NOT ONE HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR.

00:03:16.833 --> 00:03:20.465 line:92%
NOT ONE RECOMMENDIVE OF THE DIBBLE COMMUNITY.

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.965 line:92%
WE HAVE EVERY MAJOR NATIONAL HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION.

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.265 line:92%
THE AMA, THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION, OPPOSED TO THIS

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:30.265 line:92%
LEGISLATION. AND THESE GUYS ARE GOING FORWARD

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:39.098 line:92%
WITH LEGISLATION THAT HAS 12% SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

00:03:39.233 --> 00:03:42.465 line:92%
&gt;&gt; AS THIS IS HAPPENING, IN THE BACK GROUND, WHAT HAPPENS IF

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:51.198 line:92%
THEY PASS THIS? WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS?

00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:54.498 line:92%
STEVE DANES OFFERED AN AMENDMENT DEMOCRATS COULD VOTE FOR THAT

00:03:54.633 --> 00:03:59.232 line:92%
WOULD BE MEDICARE FOR ALL. NOW, ALLEY CORRECT YOU VOTED

00:03:59.366 --> 00:04:03.398 line:92%
PRESENT ON THAT AND IF SO YRGS? &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

00:04:03.533 --> 00:04:08.032 line:92%
WHAT I SAID WAS, THANK YOU FOR BEING A REPUBLICAN WHO

00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:11.665 line:92%
UNDERSTANDS THAT OUR DYSFUNCTIONAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.232 line:92%
NEEDS FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE AND WE NEED TO JOIN THE REST OF THE

00:04:15.366 --> 00:04:17.832 line:92%
INDUSTRIALIZED WORLD IN GUARANTEEING HEALTH CARE.

00:04:17.933 --> 00:04:20.932 line:92%
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SENATOR, A VERY CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN.

00:04:21.066 --> 00:04:25.265 line:92%
THEN I SAID, SENATOR DANES, YOU GET FOUR OR FIVE OTHER

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:27.665 line:92%
REPUBLICANS TO VOTE FOR THIS AND YOU VOTE FOR IT.

00:04:27.799 --> 00:04:33.232 line:92%
I THINK WE CAN PASS THIS THING. NEEDLESS TO SAY, SENATOR DANES,

00:04:33.366 --> 00:04:34.865 line:92%
THE GUY WHO OFFERED THE BILL DIDN'T VOTE FOR IT.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.699 line:92%
NO REPUBLICAN VOTED FOR IT. MY RESPONSE IS WE WILL OFFER A

00:04:38.833 --> 00:04:41.965 line:92%
MEDICARE FOR ALL SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM WHEN WE ARE READY.

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.965 line:92%
AND THAT WILL BE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:50.332 line:92%
NOT RESPOND -- NO INTENTION OF VOTING FOR THIS IN THE FIRST

00:04:50.466 --> 00:04:52.332 line:92%
PLACE. &gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN TALKING TO STAFF

00:04:52.466 --> 00:04:55.598 line:92%
AND TEXTING. AND THERE ARE OUTSTANDING

00:04:55.733 --> 00:05:01.132 line:92%
QUESTIONS FOR REAL PEOPLE WITH REAL PEOPLE'S LIVES ON THE LINE.

00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:03.998 line:92%
CAN THEY BE SO RECKLESS THAT THEY SIGN INTO LAW SOMETHING

00:05:04.133 --> 00:05:08.132 line:92%
THEY ALL AGREE IS BAD AND RECKLESS AND WILL ESSENTIALLY

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:12.432 line:92%
BLOW UP INSURANCE MARKETS FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE?

00:05:12.566 --> 00:05:17.698 line:92%
IT SEEMS INCOINCOMPREHENSIBLE THEY'LL DO THAT.

00:05:17.833 --> 00:05:23.298 line:92%
BUT I'LL NOT SO SURE THEY WON'T DO THAT.

00:05:23.433 --> 00:05:29.432 line:92%
&gt;&gt; THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS NOW A RIGHT WING EXTREMIST PARTY

00:05:29.566 --> 00:05:31.265 line:92%
DOMINATED BY THE KOCH BROTHERS IDEOLOGY.

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:37.932 line:92%
AND THEY DO NOT WANT TO SEE CUTS TO SOCIAL SECURITY OR MEDICARE.

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.765 line:92%
THEY WANT TO ELIMINATE EVERY FEDERAL PROGRAM PASSED IN THE

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:46.365 line:92%
LAST 80 YEARS DESIGNED TO PROTECT WORKING FAMILIES OR THE

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:50.232 line:92%
ELDERLY OR THE SICK OR THE POOR. THIS IS BEGINNING OF THE AGENDA.

00:05:50.366 --> 00:05:54.165 line:92%
IF THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL, IN WHATEVER THIS THING TURNED OUT

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.265 line:92%
TO BE, CUTTING MEDICAID, ET CETERA, MARK MY WORDS, MARK MY

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.165 line:92%
WORDS. THEY'LL BE BACK TO PRIVATIZE

00:06:02.333 --> 00:06:05.799 line:92%
MEDICARE WITHIN A FEW MONTHS, AND THEN THEY'LL GO AFTER SOCIAL

00:06:05.933 --> 00:06:12.065 line:92%
SECURITY AND THE VETERAN ADMINISTRATION.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.132 line:92%
WHAT THEY HAVE BEHIND THEM ARE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:06:15.266 --> 00:06:18.799 line:92%
FROM BILLIONAIRES WHO WANT TO DESTROY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S

00:06:18.933 --> 00:06:19.665 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
EFFORT TO FREQUENT
