00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:05.137 size:84% position:42%
- [James] This is a Black
Nouveau web exclusive.

00:00:05.137 --> 00:00:07.640 size:84% position:42% line:0%
This is the final part
of our extended interview

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.774 line:0%
with diversity trainer

00:00:08.774 --> 00:00:11.644 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
and human rights
activist, Jane Elliott.

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:14.147 align:start size:97% position:3%
Today, most urban sectors,
especially Milwaukee,

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:18.684 size:84% position:42%
remains hyper segregated,
why has it taken so long

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:20.753 align:start size:97% position:3%
or why doesn't it seem
like we can move the button

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:22.388
on diversity in neighborhoods?

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:24.390 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
- Because the people who have
the power in this country

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.492 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
are the people
who have the money

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:27.727 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
and the people
who have the money

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:29.862 line:0%
are going to decide
where people live,

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:31.864
you need to realize that
there are more children

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:34.967
attending segregated schools
in the United States today,

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:38.404 align:start position:0%
than there were previous to
Brown versus Board of Education

00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:40.273 size:88% position:44%
and that's a fact.

00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:42.842 align:start size:88% position:13%
You need to realize that
it is not the intent

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:46.011
of white people to let
this situation change

00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:48.081 align:start size:84% position:16%
in favor of anyone
but themselves

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:51.116 align:start size:97% position:3%
and right now, white people
are really frightened,

00:00:51.116 --> 00:00:53.485 align:start size:88% position:13%
if you don't understand
the destruction

00:00:53.485 --> 00:00:56.088
of Planned Parenthood Offices

00:00:56.088 --> 00:00:58.725
and you don't understand the
wall, that we're going to build

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.726
on the southern border
of the United States,

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:02.161 size:88% position:44%
you haven't read the book,

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:04.396 size:88% position:44%
The Birth Dearth
by Ben Wattenberg,

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:05.965
Ben Wattenberg was a
brilliant Jewish man,

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:08.701 align:start size:97% position:3%
who was a member of the
American Enterprise Institute

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:12.672 align:start size:97% position:3%
and he wrote a book, the
first paragraph of which says,

00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:14.573 align:start size:97% position:3%
"The main problem confronting
the United States today

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:15.974
"is there aren't
enough white babies

00:01:15.974 --> 00:01:18.044
"being born in this country."

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:20.313 align:start position:0%
He was an advisor to presidents
of the United States,

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:23.415 size:84% position:42%
he wrote the book
in 1987, he says,

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:25.818
"If we don't change this
and change it rapidly,

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:27.720
"white people will lose
their numerical majority

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.221
"in this country and
this will no longer

00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:30.890
"be a white man's land."

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.859 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now, I'm not
misrepresenting this,

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:36.663 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm telling you exactly,
almost exactly what he says,

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:39.231 align:start position:0%
he says, "There are three
things we can do to solve this,

00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:41.067
"number one, we can pay
women to have babies,

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:42.368
"as they have been doing

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:43.903
"in Western European
nations for years,"

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:46.205
then he says, and these
are his words, not mine,

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:48.240
"Unfortunately, we would have
to pay women of all colors

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.910
"to have babies, so we
don't want to do that,"

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.645 align:start size:84% position:16%
he says, "the second
thing we could do

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:54.346
"is increase the number
of legal immigrants,

00:01:54.346 --> 00:01:56.315 size:84% position:42%
"that are allowed into
this country every year,"

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:57.650 size:84% position:42%
then once again, he says,

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.252 align:start size:84% position:16%
"unfortunately the
vast majority of those

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:01.487 align:start position:0%
"willing to come to this country
today are people of color,

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:03.022
"so we don't want to do that,"

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:04.490
the third thing he says

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.460 align:start size:97% position:3%
and white women had better
pay attention to this,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.296
"60% of the fetuses, that are
aborted every year are white,

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.698 size:84% position:42%
"if we could keep
that 60% alive,

00:02:12.698 --> 00:02:15.401 size:88% position:44%
"that would solve
our birth dearth."

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:18.871 align:start size:84% position:16%
Does that sound
like racism to you?

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:21.074 size:84% position:42%
And if it doesn't, I want
to know why it doesn't,

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:23.710 size:84% position:42%
if it doesn't, you don't
understand what racism is

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.010
and I think it does.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.014
When we close Planned
Parenthood Clinics,

00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:30.883
because we think they're
there only for abortion,

00:02:30.883 --> 00:02:32.051
we need to take another look,

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:33.552 align:start size:88% position:13%
they are used for
many, many, many things

00:02:33.552 --> 00:02:35.521
and many women need the things

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:38.024 align:start size:97% position:3%
that they can get from
Planned Parenthood Clinics,

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:40.459
but we are willing to do
away with all that good

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.895
to avoid allowing white women

00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:45.964 size:88% position:44%
to have control of
their own bodies.

00:02:45.964 --> 00:02:48.100 align:start size:88% position:13%
Now nobody had better
tell one of my daughters

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.272 align:start size:97% position:3%
or granddaughters what they
can do with their body,

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.508
you haven't that right.

00:02:56.508 --> 00:02:59.178 align:start size:97% position:3%
Now, it would be interesting
if we were as concerned

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:01.681
about sperm cells, wouldn't it?

00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:06.252
I mean, we could take
a whole lot of fun

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:07.754
out of you boys' lives.

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:11.090 size:84% position:42%
- [James] Right, a lot of
people don't understand

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.061
the traumas associated
with race and racism,

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:16.829
can you talk a little
bit about the traumas

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:17.830
associated with it?

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.365
- The trauma associated with it?

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:20.299
- [James] Yes.

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.533
- One of the main traumas is

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:23.069
it tells white people,
that they are superior,

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.804
because of the lack of
melanin in their skin

00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:27.273
and then they find out suddenly,

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:28.874
that we've got a
black President,

00:03:28.874 --> 00:03:31.778
that's traumatic, that's
where their trauma is,

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:35.447 size:84% position:42%
living a lie, finding out
the truth is traumatic,

00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:38.684 align:start size:97% position:3%
finding out now, recently,
that within 30 years,

00:03:38.684 --> 00:03:41.420
white people will be in
the numerical minority

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.023
in this country is
going to be traumatic

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:46.225 size:88% position:44%
and that's the reason we
have to solve this problem

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:48.328
and we have to solve it now.

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:51.030
I will ask folks tonight,
how many of you black folks

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.998
wanna get even with
all white people

00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:54.533 align:start size:88% position:13%
and that's what white
people are quite certain

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:57.170
blacks are gonna wanna do is
get even with all white people

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.671 size:84% position:42%
and nobody ever
raised their hand

00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:01.007 align:start position:0%
and then I'll say, how many
wanna get even with one or two,

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:04.376
every hand will go up (laughs)
and you know why and so do I,

00:04:04.376 --> 00:04:06.112 align:start size:88% position:13%
white people are scared
to death right now,

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:08.114 size:84% position:42%
particularly white males,
they're scared to death,

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:10.649
that they are going to lose
their power in the future

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:12.818 align:start size:97% position:3%
and they are, but if you wanna
get ready for the future,

00:04:12.818 --> 00:04:15.455 align:start size:88% position:13%
if you wanna be treated
well in the future,

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:17.690 size:84% position:42%
treat others well
in the present,

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.727 size:84% position:42%
what we do in the present
constructs the future,

00:04:21.727 --> 00:04:25.931 align:start size:97% position:3%
what we have done in the
past, we can learn from that

00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:27.333
and we'd better learn from that,

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:29.235
those who forget the
mistakes of the past

00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:30.536 size:84% position:42%
are doomed to repeat them

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:32.071
and when you read this book,

00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:34.440 size:88% position:44%
you'll realize that that's
exactly what we're doing,

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.443
we're repeating the mistakes
that we have made in the past,

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:40.012 align:start size:97% position:3%
because we aren't teaching
about these mistakes

00:04:40.012 --> 00:04:43.248 align:start size:97% position:3%
in the present, we are not
teaching history that is true,

00:04:43.248 --> 00:04:45.417 align:start size:97% position:3%
we aren't teaching social
studies that is true,

00:04:45.417 --> 00:04:48.754 align:start size:97% position:3%
we aren't even teaching true
geography, for God sake,

00:04:48.754 --> 00:04:52.692 align:start size:84% position:16%
have ya seen the
Mercator map recently,

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:54.994 align:start size:84% position:16%
have ya seen that
great, big Greenland

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:57.729 size:88% position:44%
hanging down the middle of
that map like a ripe plum

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.999
and have ya seen the
legend at the bottom,

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:01.467
that says South America

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:04.537
is actually nine times
larger than Greenland?

00:05:04.537 --> 00:05:06.472
Were you aware of that?

00:05:07.973 --> 00:05:12.177 align:start size:97% position:3%
Most of those watching this
program are not aware of that.

00:05:12.177 --> 00:05:15.113
- [James] You mentioned
the wall several times

00:05:15.113 --> 00:05:19.885
and at first we heard several
things about the wall first,

00:05:19.885 --> 00:05:21.553
Mexico was gonna pay
for the wall and now--

00:05:21.553 --> 00:05:23.189
- Yeah, but you need to know

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:26.391
that 70% of what Mister
Number 44 and a Half

00:05:26.391 --> 00:05:28.927 align:start size:84% position:16%
said during that
campaign wasn't true

00:05:28.927 --> 00:05:31.230
and the wall business
wasn't true either,

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.932
if his mouth is moving,
his lips are moving,

00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:35.268 size:88% position:44%
he's probably lying, you
know that as well as I do,

00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:37.336 size:84% position:42%
he doesn't intend
to build a wall,

00:05:37.336 --> 00:05:39.004 size:88% position:44%
we can't afford to
build that wall,

00:05:39.004 --> 00:05:40.840
we have no business
building that wall,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.643 align:start size:97% position:3%
we would be keeping
Americans out of America,

00:05:44.643 --> 00:05:46.445
what's your question?

00:05:46.445 --> 00:05:49.048 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [James] The question on
the wall is there's you know,

00:05:49.048 --> 00:05:51.250 align:start size:84% position:16%
when you talk to
people about the wall,

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.718 size:84% position:42%
to certain people
about the wall,

00:05:52.718 --> 00:05:56.154 align:start size:97% position:3%
there's certain people for
it, certain people against it,

00:05:56.154 --> 00:05:59.492
the people who are for
it, what's your mindset?

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:01.827 align:start size:97% position:3%
- They're scared, they're
afraid those people,

00:06:01.827 --> 00:06:03.596
those immigrants are
gonna come over here

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:06.064
and take their jobs.

00:06:06.064 --> 00:06:08.768 align:start size:97% position:3%
Let me tell you something,
you can build a wall,

00:06:08.768 --> 00:06:11.738 size:84% position:42%
you can build a
wall 50 feet tall

00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:15.742 align:start size:97% position:3%
and smart Hispanics,
Latinos, smart Ecuadorians,

00:06:16.942 --> 00:06:20.446
smart others are gonna
tunnel under that wall

00:06:20.446 --> 00:06:23.682 align:start size:97% position:3%
and come up in their friend's
house on the other side,

00:06:23.682 --> 00:06:26.752 align:start size:88% position:13%
you can build walls
until hell freezes over,

00:06:26.752 --> 00:06:29.121 align:start size:97% position:3%
you will not keep that
immigration from happening

00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:30.823 size:88% position:44%
and you'd better
hope we don't keep

00:06:30.823 --> 00:06:34.059 align:start position:0%
that immigration from
happening, we need those people,

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:36.862
do you know what will happen
to the economy of this country,

00:06:36.862 --> 00:06:38.397 size:88% position:44%
if we take all the people,

00:06:38.397 --> 00:06:41.333 align:start position:0%
who are brown-skinned
immigrants out of this country,

00:06:41.333 --> 00:06:42.601
if we send them back,

00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:44.370
do you know what will
happen to our economy?

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.373 align:start size:97% position:3%
Do you know what will happen
to farming in California?

00:06:47.373 --> 00:06:49.742
Do you know what will happen
to the price of your fruit?

00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:52.811 align:start size:97% position:3%
Do you know how hard it will
be to get a good avocado?

00:06:52.811 --> 00:06:54.980 align:start size:84% position:16%
Do you have any idea
what will happen

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.749 size:88% position:44%
to this country's economy,

00:06:56.749 --> 00:07:00.186 size:88% position:44%
if all those brown-skinned
people go back to Mexico?

00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:01.387
I don't think we do,

00:07:01.387 --> 00:07:02.688 align:start size:88% position:13%
I don't think people
have thought about that,

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:06.058
because they are being
taught not to think,

00:07:06.058 --> 00:07:07.727
they are using a
language right now,

00:07:07.727 --> 00:07:12.130
we are using a language, that
includes words like extremism

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.066
and ugly language about people,

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:15.200 size:84% position:42%
who are different
from ourselves,

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.969 align:start size:88% position:13%
people who are listening
to those words,

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:19.971
they aren't listening to
the philosophy behind them,

00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:21.973
they aren't listening
to the core principles,

00:07:21.973 --> 00:07:24.710
which this person has none of.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.213
- [James] Now, just a
couple more questions.

00:07:28.213 --> 00:07:30.683 size:88% position:44%
When we hear, when
I hear people say

00:07:30.683 --> 00:07:34.887
that they're not racist
and things like that

00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:37.656 align:start position:0%
and we talk about building
racial harmony in this country,

00:07:37.656 --> 00:07:40.225 align:start size:84% position:16%
I don't think I'll
see it in my lifetime,

00:07:40.225 --> 00:07:42.762 align:start size:97% position:3%
can you predict in a near
future, a far future,

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:45.130
when we will ever
have racial harmony

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.632 align:start size:88% position:13%
in this country?
- Oh yeah, in 30 years,

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:50.402
white people will have found
out that they have no choice,

00:07:50.402 --> 00:07:51.637
but to get along with those

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:53.105 size:84% position:42%
who are different
from themselves,

00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:54.807 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm not willing, I'd love
to wait, but I can't,

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:57.009 align:start size:88% position:13%
at my age, I'm not gonna
be here in 30 years,

00:07:57.009 --> 00:07:59.878 size:88% position:44%
but we could change this
situation, if we chose to.

00:07:59.878 --> 00:08:03.382 align:start size:97% position:3%
During the second World
War, we called the Japanese

00:08:03.382 --> 00:08:05.384
and you'll pardon me, but
this is what we called 'em,

00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:07.053 align:start size:97% position:3%
slant-eyed little yellow,
- Hm-mm.

00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:09.722
- we didn't say that
about the Germans.

00:08:09.722 --> 00:08:13.192 align:start size:97% position:3%
After the war, we
rebuilt Germany and Japan

00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:15.794 align:start size:97% position:3%
and we get along beautifully
with the Japanese,

00:08:15.794 --> 00:08:19.431
that was in 1945, that
we finally won that war,

00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:22.134
how many years ago was that?

00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:23.735
Figure that out quickly.

00:08:23.735 --> 00:08:25.003
- [James] I'm not a math person,

00:08:25.003 --> 00:08:26.037 align:start size:97% position:3%
by the--
- You're not a math person,

00:08:26.037 --> 00:08:27.540
but you know it wasn't that far,

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.740
- [James] Right.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.208 align:start size:84% position:16%
- and it didn't
take 50 years for us

00:08:30.208 --> 00:08:32.344 size:84% position:42%
to have peace with the
Japanese and the Germans,

00:08:32.344 --> 00:08:34.947 size:84% position:42%
even though, even
though we dropped

00:08:34.947 --> 00:08:37.616 size:88% position:44%
two atomic bombs on Japan,

00:08:37.616 --> 00:08:41.554 align:start size:97% position:3%
the Japanese hadn't
killed 10 million people,

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:46.191
nowhere near that, we didn't
drop any bombs on Germany,

00:08:46.191 --> 00:08:47.793
any atomic bombs on Germany,

00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:49.261 align:start size:84% position:16%
they were a different
kind of people,

00:08:49.261 --> 00:08:51.196
we couldn't afford to do that,

00:08:51.196 --> 00:08:55.368
we killed how many Japanese
people with two atomic bombs

00:08:57.203 --> 00:09:00.906 align:start size:97% position:3%
and they forgave us, you
wanna talk about forgiveness?

00:09:00.906 --> 00:09:04.276
You wanna talk about
changing this thing?

00:09:04.276 --> 00:09:07.312
I cannot understand
how Japanese people

00:09:07.312 --> 00:09:11.751 align:start size:97% position:3%
can stand the sight of
any of us and yet they do,

00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:13.885
I cannot understand
why black people,

00:09:13.885 --> 00:09:16.688 align:start size:88% position:13%
who have been subjected
to the ugliness,

00:09:16.688 --> 00:09:19.291 align:start size:97% position:3%
that they've been subjected
to in this country

00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:22.227
can get up every morning
and go to work among us

00:09:22.227 --> 00:09:24.664
and not be absolutely furious

00:09:26.598 --> 00:09:28.634 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I don't understand
why we allow

00:09:28.634 --> 00:09:31.136 align:start size:84% position:16%
white people to behave
the way they do,

00:09:31.136 --> 00:09:32.571
I don't understand that

00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:33.806
and my third graders,

00:09:33.806 --> 00:09:35.173
after they've gone
through the exercise

00:09:35.173 --> 00:09:37.676
couldn't understand it
and wouldn't tolerate it

00:09:37.676 --> 00:09:39.578 size:88% position:44%
and when they went
up to junior high

00:09:39.578 --> 00:09:42.681 align:start size:88% position:13%
and a junior high
teacher used the N word,

00:09:42.681 --> 00:09:44.816
one of my former students said,

00:09:44.816 --> 00:09:46.252
"If you're gonna use that word,

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:47.719 align:start size:97% position:3%
"I'm gonna go out in the
hall, until you stop using it,

00:09:47.719 --> 00:09:50.589 align:start size:97% position:3%
"'cause we don't use that
word in this school,"

00:09:50.589 --> 00:09:53.325 size:84% position:42%
that was a sixth,
a seventh grader,

00:09:53.325 --> 00:09:54.693 size:84% position:42%
who told his teacher off,

00:09:54.693 --> 00:09:56.395
when we have enough students,

00:09:56.395 --> 00:09:59.264 align:start size:97% position:3%
who are willing to confront
people who are making

00:09:59.264 --> 00:10:01.333
racist, sexist, ageist,
homophobic statements,

00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:02.835 size:88% position:44%
we're gonna be better off,

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:06.104 align:start size:97% position:3%
we have got to stop
tolerating the intolerable,

00:10:06.104 --> 00:10:08.073
if it's intolerable
for my black cousins

00:10:08.073 --> 00:10:10.943 align:start size:97% position:3%
and every black person on this
Earth is one of my cousins,

00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:13.679 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
if it's intolerable for them,
it's intolerable for me,

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:16.549 line:0%
I will not tolerate it,
I will not tolerate it,

00:10:16.549 --> 00:10:18.316
that is not...

00:10:18.316 --> 00:10:20.853 align:start size:97% position:3%
I am required not to tolerate
that kind of treatment

00:10:20.853 --> 00:10:22.822 size:88% position:44%
for the people who
are related to me

00:10:22.822 --> 00:10:26.258 size:84% position:42%
and that's every person
of the face of the Earth,

00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:28.761
if your ignorance is such,
that you mistreat somebody,

00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:31.630 align:start size:97% position:3%
because of your ignorance
about the color of their skin,

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.933
don't do it around me.

00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:37.102 align:start position:0%
Number one, I've been threatened
with death lots of times,

00:10:37.102 --> 00:10:39.137
now I say, go for it, fool,

00:10:39.137 --> 00:10:41.039
my husband died four years ago,

00:10:41.039 --> 00:10:45.544
being with him would not
be a bad thing for me,

00:10:45.544 --> 00:10:48.313 align:start size:97% position:3%
death is not the worst thing
that can happen to you,

00:10:48.313 --> 00:10:52.485 align:start size:97% position:3%
living a worthless, useless
life is much worse than dying.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.089
