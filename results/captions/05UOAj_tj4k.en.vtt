I COULD SEE HIM GETTING MORE
HEATED.

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.739 align:start position:0%
HE WAS UPSET WITH ME ABOUT AM
SOV THE QUESTIONS, THAT IS OKAY.

00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:29.075 align:start position:0%
HE WAS A LITTLE
IRSTATE-- IRRITATED.

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:30.243 align:start position:0%
THAT IS OKAY.

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:32.612

BE ABLE TO ASK MY QUESTIONS, SO

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:03.376
I THOUGHT WHAT CAN I DO TO SAVE
THE INTERVIEW, I THOUGHT IF I
