00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.870
Well, you all know that we
love sending our receptionist,

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.860
Jeannie around the country to help us
surprise deserving people in need.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.830
Today she's in Brooklyn, New York.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.041
Let's check in with her right now.

00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:11.086
&gt;&gt; Hey, Jeannie.

00:00:11.086 --> 00:00:11.701
&gt;&gt; Hi, Ellen.

00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:12.421
&gt;&gt; How you doing?

00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:13.420
&gt;&gt; Hi!

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.020
I'm good, how are you?

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.790
&gt;&gt; I'm really good.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.440
Tell us who we're surprising today.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.030
&gt;&gt; Okay, Ellen, I'm really,
really excited about this one.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.050
The person that we're surprising started
an after school program that has helped

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.160
countless of students get
free college education.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.680
He is constantly paying out of his own
pocket to provide for this program.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.980
And, I mean, this guy,
he postponed his own wedding,

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.280
because he wanted to make sure that his
students got what they needed first.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.240
He's absolutely amazing.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.860
&gt;&gt; That's great, and
what is his name, Jeanie?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.880
&gt;&gt; His name is Lennier Young.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.800
&gt;&gt; And he's here right now.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.540
Lennier, come here.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.370
So, did you think,
well that sounds like me?

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm like, I don't know,
but, damn, Brooklyn, I'm here, I-

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.860
&gt;&gt; I started in after school program.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm like-

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.700
&gt;&gt; I postponed my wedding.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.018
&gt;&gt; I said that's sounds my story.

00:01:04.018 --> 00:01:06.020
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.850
So your name is Lennier, but
you have a nickname, right?

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.320
&gt;&gt; Yes, they called me Dinero.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.330
&gt;&gt; Why do they call you Dinero?

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.999
&gt;&gt; It's just a name that I came
up with and stuck with it, and

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:19.180
anybody just either call me Dinero or
money.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.620
&gt;&gt; All right, Dinero or money?

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.270
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.685
&gt;&gt; Well, you can call me sweet water.

00:01:23.685 --> 00:01:26.570
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I don't know why.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.270
I just decided that that's my nickname,
just now.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.020
So, tell us about
the after school program.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.240
This is really amazing what I learned.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.220
&gt;&gt; Well, the after school program,
well, I started it,

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.380
because at the age of three,
I was adopted by my mother.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.890
And we started the program, because
a lot of people made fun of me, and

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.270
made me feel like I was
abandoned at a young age.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.110
So I wanted to make sure that, I am sorry.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.870
&gt;&gt; No, it is emotional.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.550
It's good.
&gt;&gt; I wanted to make sure that no kid

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.380
ever feels abandoned, or feel like they
don't have a family, or place to go.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.170
So at Jordan Madison, I wanted to see that
we make sure that everybody succeeds.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.601
Everybody gets into school for free.

00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:10.565
And that they're outstanding,
upstanding pillars of the community.

00:02:10.565 --> 00:02:15.328
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Want a sip of water?

00:02:15.328 --> 00:02:21.061
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So

00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:25.260
and it's Drill, in Drill Masters,
tell us about that.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.910
&gt;&gt; In Drill Masters we help kids on and
off court.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.390
&gt;&gt; We teach student athletes,
not athletic students, books comes first.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.410
We help with homework.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.722
We make sure any issues that they have
in school, we make sure we address them.

00:02:38.722 --> 00:02:41.430
You can't pick up a basketball if
you are not doing good in school.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.576
So, we make sure that every kid, we have
a 90-95% rate that the kids graduate,

00:02:46.576 --> 00:02:49.012
and they're going to college for free.

00:02:49.012 --> 00:02:50.417
&gt;&gt; Thatâ€™s what I was going to ask you,
that's amazing.

00:02:50.417 --> 00:02:53.665
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; So and

00:02:53.665 --> 00:02:58.451
there's one young lady,
Daisha, I think her name is.

00:02:58.451 --> 00:02:59.334
&gt;&gt; Yes, Daisha.

00:02:59.334 --> 00:03:03.814
She came to us a couple months ago,
and she was having a rough time.

00:03:03.814 --> 00:03:07.844
She didn't have any school, so
she came on down to Drill Masters.

00:03:07.844 --> 00:03:10.202
She come all the way from Connecticut,
all the way to Brooklyn.

00:03:10.202 --> 00:03:13.859
And we've been in the gym three to four
times a week, working hard, working hard.

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.736
And over the summer she has got
numerous offers to college.

00:03:17.736 --> 00:03:19.199
So she's going to school for free.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.780
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.076
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; That's amazing.

00:03:23.076 --> 00:03:27.404
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; All right, so Jeannie is in Brooklyn,

00:03:27.404 --> 00:03:29.242

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:30.159
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.458
&gt;&gt; All right, hey, Jeannie,

They love Dinero so much.

00:03:57.522 --> 00:04:00.621
They've been talking about how wonderful
he is, how much they've done for him.

00:04:00.621 --> 00:04:03.721
You are one fantastic man and
these kids love you.

00:04:03.721 --> 00:04:04.913
&gt;&gt; I love them too.

00:04:04.913 --> 00:04:06.226
&gt;&gt; All right, so listen, we are.

00:04:06.226 --> 00:04:08.876
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; The Brooklyn Nets heard about

00:04:08.876 --> 00:04:09.418
the story.

00:04:09.418 --> 00:04:10.870
They have a little message for you.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.275
Let's watch.

00:04:12.275 --> 00:04:15.300
&gt;&gt; Hey, Dinero,

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.310
We heard your story and
think what you're doing for

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.570
the Brooklyn community is incredible.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.960
You're an awesome role model, and

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.050

&gt;&gt; So everyone there is getting tickets.

00:04:33.867 --> 00:04:36.770
[LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.582
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:04:37.582 --> 00:04:39.590

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.063
Where's Dinero's special gift?

00:04:42.063 --> 00:04:43.796
They sent you this.

00:04:43.796 --> 00:04:44.633
&gt;&gt; Aww.

00:04:44.633 --> 00:04:47.071
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:04:47.071 --> 00:04:50.356
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:50.972
&gt;&gt; You are welcome.

00:04:50.972 --> 00:04:51.796
We'll be right back.

00:04:51.796 --> 00:04:55.330
You notice there's one person that was
not in that shot with Jeannie, and

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.765
that is because she's here.

00:04:56.765 --> 00:04:57.659
Daisha come on out.

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:01.720
So, Daisha, tell me why this
guy I mean I think we all know.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.335
You can hear how amazing he is and
especially the intention of where he was

00:05:05.335 --> 00:05:09.198
coming from that he really cared about
kids, because of his own experience.

00:05:09.198 --> 00:05:11.393
But tell me about him
from your perspective.

00:05:11.393 --> 00:05:15.676
&gt;&gt; Well I joined Drill Masters early May,
and I was at a point during

00:05:15.676 --> 00:05:19.973
basketball where I was just stagnant and
stagnant with myself.

00:05:19.973 --> 00:05:22.609
And my parents sacrificed and
found Dinero.

00:05:22.609 --> 00:05:27.728
And he did his job, and I busted my
butt to get up there when I needed to.

00:05:27.728 --> 00:05:30.116
And I put in my work, and
he gave me 200% back.

00:05:30.116 --> 00:05:30.801
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:05:30.801 --> 00:05:34.336
&gt;&gt; And that's how I got these offers and
these other schools, and

00:05:34.336 --> 00:05:37.617
then it came to a point where I was like,
I'm committing.

00:05:37.617 --> 00:05:39.300
&gt;&gt; I was so excited.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.622
&gt;&gt; And I found this school, and
I fell in love with the school.

00:05:41.622 --> 00:05:42.423
And I'm happy.

00:05:42.423 --> 00:05:46.115
He really pushed me and showed
another side of me that I didn't see.

00:05:46.115 --> 00:05:47.438
&gt;&gt; That's amazing, that's amazing.

00:05:47.438 --> 00:05:49.876
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; High five.

00:05:49.876 --> 00:05:51.118
&gt;&gt; We need more of this, right?

00:05:51.118 --> 00:05:51.990
More of this everywhere.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.313
&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.

00:05:53.313 --> 00:05:57.356
&gt;&gt; If every school had a Dinero that
would make a huge different in a lot of

00:05:57.356 --> 00:05:58.272
kids' lives.

00:05:58.272 --> 00:06:02.451
We want to give you two a chance to
raise some money for Drill Masters.

00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:06.619
And I think you are gonna do a pretty
good job, let's walk over here.

00:06:10.405 --> 00:06:15.595
&gt;&gt; All right, so each basket you make
we're gonna give you $1,000 per basket for

00:06:15.595 --> 00:06:17.069

&gt;&gt; You go first?

00:06:23.075 --> 00:06:25.728
&gt;&gt; 30 seconds, so
you just keep getting those balls and

00:06:25.728 --> 00:06:27.754
somebody will keep throwing them to you.

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:30.471
Make sure we give them the balls back
as soon as they bounce off, okay?

00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:31.086
&gt;&gt; I go first.

00:06:31.086 --> 00:06:31.902
&gt;&gt; 30 seconds on the clock.
&gt;&gt; You go first?

00:06:31.902 --> 00:06:32.482
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:06:32.482 --> 00:06:33.075
&gt;&gt; Okay, go!

00:06:33.075 --> 00:06:34.979

&gt;&gt; All right, what was that?

&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; 12?

00:07:15.118 --> 00:07:18.763
All right, that was 11, that's $11,000.

00:07:18.763 --> 00:07:22.769
But Shutterfly loves helping communities
and inspiring stories like yours.

00:07:22.769 --> 00:07:26.356
They wanna round that number up and
give Drill Masters $20,000.

00:07:26.356 --> 00:07:33.450

&gt;&gt; Thank you.
