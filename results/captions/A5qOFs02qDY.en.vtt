00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.389
GUEST: My husband and I are originally from
Los Angeles.

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.689
He's a congregational rabbi, now retired.

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:12.740
And while I was working in Japan in the late
'80s, he had a phone call asking if he would

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.000
officiate at the funeral of somebody that
wasn't a member of the congregation, and met

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.130
this woman, and she was charmed by him, and
he officiated at her husband's funeral.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.610
And she invited him to dinner, and he said,
"Well my fiancé is coming back from Japan.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.640
Would you mind if it was the three of us?"

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.090
And on Sunday evenings, she had a particular
restaurant in Los Angeles which she would

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:46.390
go to, Trader Vic's, and we were part of the
Trader Vic's Sunday night dinner event.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.739
And this took place probably once a month
for almost 12 years.

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:58.859
And when she passed, she left these two items
to me in her will, and I remember admiring

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.860
the ring because that was something that she
would always wear when I would see her Sunday

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:03.860
night.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.520
APPRAISER: Now, have you ever had an appraisal
done on the bracelet or the ring?

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.080
GUEST: Just on the bracelet.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.930
And, at the time, in the early 2000s, I think
they said it might have been ten grand.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.680
But I've never had the ring appraised.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.980
APPRAISER: The bracelet's kind of a classic
1940s…

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.980
GUEST: Oh.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.980
APPRAISER: …bracelet.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.120
We can tell it has some European-cut diamonds
in it.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.190
If you look through the bracelet, the larger
round stones…

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.190
GUEST: Mh-hmm.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.120
APPRAISER: …all add up to about eight carats,
total weight.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.130
GUEST: Wow.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.730
APPRAISER: Then we have these baguettes, what
they call "straight baguettes…"

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:36.730
GUEST: Mh-hmm.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.180
APPRAISER: …kind of basket-weaved throughout
it.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.040
And in those is another ten carats of diamonds.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.250
It's a Jewish appraisal.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.250
GUEST: Wow!

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.460
APPRAISER: 18 carats, that's chai.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.460
It's good luck.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.290
GUEST: That is good luck! (laughing)

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.810
APPRAISER: And then it's made out of platinum,
classic.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.000
It's built like a truck.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.420
That bracelet will never wear out.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.420
GUEST: Oh.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.240
APPRAISER: And it's fantastic.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.240
Couldn't find a signature.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.240
GUEST: Okay.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.740
APPRAISER: But when I see this kind of bracelet,
and the metal work is a little heavy, it leads

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.960
me to think something like this was probably
made in the United States, probably New York.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.960
GUEST: Okay.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.349
APPRAISER: I mean, she was out in L.A., it
certainly could have been made there.

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.609
And if I told you that $10,000 today appraisal
is low.

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:22.989
Today, if I had to reappraise that for auction,
I would tell you that bracelet would be $15,000

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.489
to $20,000.

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:25.989
GUEST: Wow.

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.079
That's... (breathlessly) ...quite, quite a
gift.

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.430
APPRAISER: Well, I'm not here for the bracelet.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.430
I'm here for the ring.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.430
GUEST: Oh, really?

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.430
APPRAISER: All right?

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.430
GUEST: Okay.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.430
APPRAISER: So let's go.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.430
(chuckling)

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.430
GUEST: Okay.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.519
APPRAISER: So, first, I love the...

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:40.659
I love pearls.

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.540
The pearl in the middle is about 14 millimeters.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.329
It's a little bit of a button pearl.

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:46.640
Instead of being very round…

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.640
GUEST: Mh-hmm.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.769
APPRAISER: …it's sloped down a little bit.

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:49.769
GUEST: Yes.

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:50.780
APPRAISER: Some pearls are cultured, some
are natural…

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.780
GUEST: Mh-hmm.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.989
APPRAISER: …and we're kind of assuming that
this is cultured.

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.530
I mean, down the road, you could always have
it X-rayed.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.719
If we turn it to the side, everybody can see
it's beautifully set, what we call "pavè-set"

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:04.719
diamonds.

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:05.719
GUEST: Mh-hmm.

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:09.969
APPRAISER: They're set so close together,
there's one or two beads holding each other

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:10.969
in.

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:11.969
GUEST: Oh.

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:12.969
APPRAISER: It's made out of platinum.

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:13.969
The pearl is later.

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:15.010
The bracelet's from the '40s.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.390
I talked to my colleagues and we feel the
ring is probably mid-20th century, maybe early

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.390
'60s.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.390
GUEST: Okay.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.760
APPRAISER: Platinum, about six carats of diamonds.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.760
GUEST: Wow.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.760
APPRAISER: Now, when we turn the ring around…

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.760
GUEST: Yes.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.610
APPRAISER: …and we pull it off, over here
is where the magic starts to happen.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.129
We can see right over here…

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.129
APPRAISER: Mh-hmm.

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.159
GUEST: …it is signed.

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.159
"V.C.A."

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:41.950
GUEST: (gasps) Van Cleef and Arpels!

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:42.950
APPRAISER: Yeah.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.000
GUEST: Holy moly!

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.540
She said something about Van Cleef and Arpels.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.930
I always thought it was the bracelet!

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:48.930
APPRAISER: I know you did.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.930
(laughing)

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:50.930
GUEST: Wow!

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:51.930
Wow.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.730
Amazing, because I asked you earlier.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:54.730
Wow.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.739
APPRAISER: What did I say?

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.980
GUEST: You said, "No, not the bracelet."

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.640
But you didn't tell me anything about the
ring.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.260
Wow, what a pleasant surprise.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.620
APPRAISER: And it was a pleasant surprise
for me, too.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.700
This is the kicker.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:17.190
If the ring came up for sale, I feel very
strongly for it, at auction, at $20,000 to

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.590
$30,000.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:25.000
GUEST: As Shirley Temple would say, "Oh, my
goodness!" (laughing) Wow.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.729
APPRAISER: And it's the kind of thing, I think,
would get to the high end of the estimate

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:30.729
pretty quick…

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:31.729
GUEST: Wow.

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:32.729
APPRAISER: …because, frankly, this is very
sought after.

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:39.490
If I was doing this for insurance replacement
value, I believe you'd have to put the bracelet

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.590
at $35,000.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.270
GUEST: Wow.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.270
Amazing.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.389
APPRAISER: But the ring, because it's Van
Cleef, for insurance replacement, would probably

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:49.919
be closer to $60,000.

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.150
GUEST: Oh, my goodness, thank you.
