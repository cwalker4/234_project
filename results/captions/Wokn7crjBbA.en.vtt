00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:07.666
[music playing]

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.766
- I'M A SCIENCE-FICTION FAN,

00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.400
AND I'VE LONG FELT
THAT THIS AGENCY

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.200
OUGHT TO BE ON OUR WAY
TO THE STARS.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.400
SO--AND WE ARE.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.933
BUT I THINK SOME OF THE THINGS
YOU'RE GONNA HEAR TODAY

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.200
MAY GET US THERE
A LOT FASTER.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.300
SO THIS, YOU KNOW, OUR--

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.333
I THINK IT'S THE PENULTIMATE
TALK IN THE SUMMER SERIES.

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:42.100
THIS IS A SERIES TO CELEBRATE
NASA AMES' 75TH ANNIVERSARY.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.800
BY THE WAY,
AT THE PICNIC THE OTHER DAY,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.600
I MET A FELLOW
THAT STARTED WORKING HERE

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.266
RIGHT AFTER WE WERE FOUNDED
IN 1940,

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.066
SO, REALLY COOL.

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.000
SO AMES IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.133
[laughter]

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:57.666
THAT DOESN'T WORK STATISTICALLY?

00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:01.266
BUT TODAY WE HAVE
DR. HAROLD "SONNY" WHITE,

00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.133
IS OUR GUEST.

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:06.200
HE HOLDS A Ph.D. IN PHYSICS
FROM RICE UNIVERSITY,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.200
A MASTER OF SCIENCE
IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.000
FROM WICHITA STATE UNIVERSITY,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.466
AND A BACHELOR OF SCIENCE
IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING

00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:15.366
FROM THE UNIVERSITY
OF SOUTH ALABAMA.

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.466
HE CURRENTLY SERVES

00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.433
AS THE ADVANCED PROPULSION
THEME LEAD

00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:20.566
FOR THE NASA
ENGINEERING DIRECTORATE

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.400
AND IS THE JSC REPRESENTATIVE

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.233
TO THE NUCLEAR SYSTEMS
WORKING GROUP.

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:26.500
KIND OF COOL STUFF.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.100
HE IS SERVING TO HELP THE AGENCY

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.200
INCORPORATE HIGH TRL
ADVANCED POWER

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.700
AND PROPULSION TECHNOLOGIES

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.766
INTO NEAR AND MID-TERM
HUMAN EXPLORATION ARCHITECTURES.

00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:35.966
BUT HE'S ALSO PURSUING

00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:37.933
THEORETICAL AND
LABORATORY RESEARCH

00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:42.733
ON DEVELOPING LOWER TRL
ADVANCED PROPULSION

00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:43.933
AND POWER TECHNOLOGIES

00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:45.666
IN THE ADVANCED PROPULSION
PHYSICS LABORATORY

00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:47.100
KNOWN AS EAGLEWORKS.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.700
THAT IS LOCATED
AT THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.466
WHICH I'M ON MY WAY TO
THIS AFTERNOON,

00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:52.866
WHERE IT'S 98 DEGREES
WHEN I LOOKED AT THE--

00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:54.200
AND THE HUMIDITY, I THINK,
IS ABOUT THE SAME.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.366
SO BE GLAD
YOU'RE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:58.200
OH, BY THE WAY,
BEFORE I GO ON,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.233
TOMORROW IS A TALK
ON A LOT LESS FUN TOPIC,

00:02:02.233 --> 00:02:03.233
BUT ONE YOU ALL NEED TO KNOW.

00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:05.266
IT'S ABOUT EXPORT CONTROL.

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:09.833
SO I DO URGE ALL THE STAFF
TO BE HERE.

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:15.200
THE--CHUCK DUFF WILL BE TAKING,
YOU KNOW, ATTENDANCE.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.166
I PARTICULARLY WANT
THE MANAGERS TO BE HERE.

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:20.766
I GOT IN TROUBLE
OVER THAT STUFF A FEW YEARS AGO.

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:22.533
SO WE'RE GONNA DO
A LOT BETTER.

00:02:22.533 --> 00:02:26.133
BUT, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,

00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:30.100
LET ME SAY HELLO
TO MY FRIEND AND MY COLLEAGUE,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.533
SONNY WHITE
FROM JOHNSON SPACE CENTER.

00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:33.800
THE STAGE IS YOURS.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.233
- THANKS, PETE;
APPRECIATE IT.

00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:36.533
[applause]

00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:37.933
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.

00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:40.366
[applause]

00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:42.133
THANKS FOR COMING
TO JOIN ME TODAY.

00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:45.100
AS PART OF COMING
INTO THIS SERIES,

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.566
I WAS ASKED TO MAYBE TALK
A LITTLE BIT

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:50.566
ABOUT WHAT GOT ME INTO WORKING
IN THE SPACE INDUSTRY,

00:02:50.566 --> 00:02:53.133
WHAT WAS SOME OF THE BACKGROUND
THAT INSPIRED ME.

00:02:53.133 --> 00:02:56.266
I GREW UP IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,

00:02:56.266 --> 00:02:58.500
JUST OUTSIDE OF D.C.,
IN VIRGINIA,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.633
AND SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME

00:03:00.633 --> 00:03:05.833
GOING TO THE AIR AND SPACE
SMITHSONIAN IN D.C.,

00:03:05.833 --> 00:03:07.266
AND I WAS REALLY INSPIRED

00:03:07.266 --> 00:03:11.533
BY ALL OF THE DISPLAYS
THAT THEY HAD THERE

00:03:11.533 --> 00:03:15.766
OF THE APOLLO PROGRAM,
A LOT OF THE AIRCRAFT.

00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:18.700
SO I THINK I GOT THE BUG
AT A VERY EARLY AGE

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.833
TO WANT TO GET
INTO THE SPACE PROGRAM.

00:03:21.833 --> 00:03:23.900
SO IT WAS QUITE A TREAT
TO BE ABLE

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.500
TO EVENTUALLY FIND MY WAY
WORKING AT NASA

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.466
ON HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT
BACK IN 2000.

00:03:31.466 --> 00:03:34.333
SO HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE
A LOT OF YEARS IN THE FUTURE

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:35.766
TO TRY AND CONTRIBUTE
TO THE CAUSE

00:03:35.766 --> 00:03:37.700
THAT WE ALL KIND OF CARE ABOUT,

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.166
IN TERMS OF TRYING
TO GO AND EXPLORE

00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:41.400
AND FIGURE OUT SOME NEW THINGS.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.933
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND
ON SOME OF THE STUFF THAT I DO

00:03:43.933 --> 00:03:45.433
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT HIGHER
IN THE TRL.

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:47.333
PETE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT
THAT I DO WORK

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:49.666
WITH SOME HIGHER TRL STUFF.

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:51.866
I'VE DONE SOME WORK
WITH TRYING TO INTEGRATE

00:03:51.866 --> 00:03:54.733
THINGS LIKE HALL THRUSTERS
INTO HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT.

00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:56.033
AND YOU SEE A LITTLE--

00:03:56.033 --> 00:03:58.500
A MONTAGE OF SOME
OF THE PROJECTS I'VE WORKED

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.433
OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS,

00:04:00.433 --> 00:04:04.200
TRYING TO INTEGRATE
THINGS LIKE HALL THRUSTERS

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.400
INTO HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT
PLATFORMS.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.100
YOU SEE, ON THE TOP LEFT THERE,
THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.066
WE LOOKED AT USING
HALL THRUSTERS

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:15.700
TO PROVIDE SOME DRAG MAKEUP.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.566
SO WE SPENT SOME TIME
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:04:17.566 --> 00:04:21.166
HOW TO INTEGRATE THOSE
ONTO THE SPACE STATION.

00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:22.533
TYPICALLY,
IN HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT,

00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:25.366
WE ALWAYS THINK OF ROCKETS
THAT HAVE NOZZLES,

00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:27.500
AND THEY MAKE A LOT OF SMOKE
AND A LOT OF NOISE

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.333
AND HAVE A THRUST-TO-WEIGHT
RATIO GREATER THAN ONE.

00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:32.866
SO IT TOOK A LITTLE BIT
OF TIME AND EFFORT

00:04:32.866 --> 00:04:36.500
TO HELP PEOPLE OVERCOME
THE PERSPECTIVE

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.066
THAT LOW THRUST
MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY

00:04:38.066 --> 00:04:39.266
BE SOMETHING THAT WE CAN USE,

00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:42.100
BUT IT TURNS OUT
IT REALLY CAN HELP

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.700
WITH HUMAN SPACE EXPLORATION.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.600
AND SO WE LOOKED
AT SEVERAL OTHER THINGS

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.800
ABOUT USING LOW THRUST
IN SPACE PROPULSION SYSTEMS.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.600
ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT,
YOU SEE A CONCEPT

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.200
THAT LOOKED AT TRYING
TO USE HALL THRUSTERS

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.600
WITH SOME ASSETS IN THE
EARTH-MOON LAGRANGE POINT AREA.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.466
THIS WAS KIND OF A PRECURSOR
TO THE ASTEROID MISSION.

00:05:01.466 --> 00:05:04.133
AND WE ALSO DID SOME WORK
WITH DARPA

00:05:04.133 --> 00:05:06.066
TO KIND OF THINK ABOUT WAYS

00:05:06.066 --> 00:05:10.233
THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO
SOME COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS.

00:05:10.233 --> 00:05:11.766
BUT THESE ARE ALL CONCEPTS

00:05:11.766 --> 00:05:14.866
THAT TRY AND ADDRESS
GETTING OUT OF LOW EARTH ORBIT

00:05:14.866 --> 00:05:17.033
INTO CIS/TRANS LUNAR SPACE,

00:05:17.033 --> 00:05:19.333
MAYBE ONE DAY OUT TO MARS.

00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:21.400
IT'S AT 1 1/2 A.U.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.600
BUT WHAT IF WE WANT
TO GO THROUGH

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.233
AND EXPLORE THE REST
OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM?

00:05:24.233 --> 00:05:27.833
WHAT IF WE WANT TO GET OUT TO
SOME OTHER LOCATIONS WITH PEOPLE

00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:29.066
IN THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM?

00:05:29.066 --> 00:05:31.533
WHAT IF WE REALLY WANT
TO TRY AND GO

00:05:31.533 --> 00:05:33.800
TO SOMEPLACE
THAT'S EVEN FURTHER,

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.933
SOME TYPE OF
AN INTERSTELLAR DESTINATION?

00:05:35.933 --> 00:05:39.200
I THINK YOU HAVE A TALK
ON KEPLER IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.500
AND KEPLER'S IDENTIFYING

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.400
A LOT OF VERY NEAT THINGS
THAT ARE OUT THERE,

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.633
AND WE'RE FINDING OUT

00:05:43.633 --> 00:05:45.733
THAT THERE'S A LOT
OF PLANETS OUT THERE,

00:05:45.733 --> 00:05:48.200
AND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
IS NOT UNIQUE

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.966
FROM THE STANDPOINT
THAT IT HAS BODIES

00:05:50.966 --> 00:05:52.000
THAT ORBIT THE SUN.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.033
SO THAT TENDS
TO MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT,

00:05:55.033 --> 00:05:57.333
"WHAT DOES IT TAKE
TO ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THAT?"

00:05:57.333 --> 00:06:01.000
SO LET'S SEGUE INTO
A MUCH LOWER TRL DISCUSSION.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.633
I'LL TALK ABOUT TWO THINGS:

00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:04.400
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE IDEA
OF A SPACEWARP,

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.766
AND THEN WE'LL TALK ABOUT
A FORM OF ELECTRIC PROPULSION

00:06:07.766 --> 00:06:09.166
YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN IN THE NEWS

00:06:09.166 --> 00:06:11.033
WE'RE WORKING ON AT JSC
CALLED Q-THRUSTERS.

00:06:11.033 --> 00:06:12.600
AND SO WE'LL TALK TO YOU GUYS
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.333
AND SOME OF THE DATA
WE PRESENTED

00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:18.400
AT THE JOINT PROPULSION
CONFERENCE IN OHIO.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.133
SO, WHEN WE TALK
ABOUT INTERSTELLAR SPACEFLIGHT,

00:06:22.133 --> 00:06:24.166
A LOT OF PEOPLE
REALLY HAVE NO GRASP

00:06:24.166 --> 00:06:26.600
ON HOW FAR THESE DISTANCES ARE,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.733
COMPARED TO WHAT
WE CAN DO TODAY.

00:06:29.733 --> 00:06:32.133
SO I THINK,
IN TERMS OF STATE-OF-THE-ART,

00:06:32.133 --> 00:06:34.966
THE "VOYAGER 1" SPACECRAFT
IS A REALLY GOOD ILLUSTRATION

00:06:34.966 --> 00:06:36.633
OF THE BEST
THAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR

00:06:36.633 --> 00:06:40.666
IN TERMS OF
AN INTERSTELLAR MISSION.

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:43.866
SO THE "VOYAGER 1" SPACECRAFT
WAS LAUNCHED IN THE LATE '70s.

00:06:43.866 --> 00:06:45.566
IT GAVE US ALL THOSE
REALLY NICE PICTURES

00:06:45.566 --> 00:06:47.366
OF THE OUTER PLANETS
IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

00:06:47.366 --> 00:06:49.000
THAT KIND OF INSPIRED US.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.433
IT'S BEEN ON ITS WAY
FOR ABOUT 30 YEARS.

00:06:51.433 --> 00:06:53.933
IT'S MOVING AT ABOUT
3.6 A.U. PER YEAR.

00:06:53.933 --> 00:06:57.133
AN A.U. IS THE DISTANCE
FROM THE EARTH TO THE SUN.

00:06:57.133 --> 00:06:59.866
IT'S CURRENTLY AT ABOUT
120 ASTRONOMICAL UNITS

00:06:59.866 --> 00:07:01.766
OUT INTO THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.700
SO WE COULD ASK THE QUESTION:

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.666
HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE
"VOYAGER 1"

00:07:08.666 --> 00:07:10.166
TO MAKE IT TO OUR NEAREST STAR

00:07:10.166 --> 00:07:11.866
IF IT HAPPENED TO BE GOING
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION?

00:07:11.866 --> 00:07:13.166
IT TURNS OUT IT'S NOT.

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:16.633
ALPHA CENTAURI IS ALMOST
DUE SOUTH FROM THE PLANET.

00:07:16.633 --> 00:07:19.366
BUT IF IT HAPPENED TO BE POINTED
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION,

00:07:19.366 --> 00:07:21.566
HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE FOR IT
TO GET TO ALPHA CENTAURI?

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:22.600
IT TURNS OUT IT WOULD TAKE

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.533
A RIDICULOUSLY LONG
PERIOD OF TIME,

00:07:24.533 --> 00:07:26.766
75,000 YEARS.

00:07:26.766 --> 00:07:28.133
AND SO,
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS.

00:07:28.133 --> 00:07:32.766
THAT'S A REALLY LONG TIME
TO SIT ON CONSOLE, SO...

00:07:32.766 --> 00:07:34.633
BUT ANYWAY, IT REALLY DOES
HIGHLIGHT THE FACT

00:07:34.633 --> 00:07:37.600
THAT INTERSTELLAR DISTANCES
ARE VERY, VERY DIFFICULT

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.166
COMPARED TO ANYTHING
THAT WE'VE DONE

00:07:40.166 --> 00:07:42.133
OR EVER THOUGHT ABOUT DOING.

00:07:42.133 --> 00:07:45.733
TO KIND OF CONTINUE
TO HIGHLIGHT THE CHALLENGES

00:07:45.733 --> 00:07:49.066
ASSOCIATED WITH
INTERSTELLAR SPACEFLIGHT,

00:07:49.066 --> 00:07:50.900
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A PROJECT
THAT WAS CONVENED

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.533
BY THE BRITISH
INTERPLANETARY SOCIETY

00:07:53.533 --> 00:07:55.666
BACK IN THE '70s

00:07:55.666 --> 00:07:57.966
TO LOOK AT GOING
TO BARNARD'S STAR.

00:07:57.966 --> 00:08:00.800
THAT'S ABOUT 6 LIGHT-YEARS AWAY.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.066
THEY WANTED TO GET THERE
IN 50 YEARS.

00:08:04.066 --> 00:08:08.600
THE SPACECRAFT THAT THEY
DEVELOPED AS PART OF THAT STUDY,

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:13.333
USING--I THINK THIS WAS
PULSED FUSION PROPULSION.

00:08:13.333 --> 00:08:16.333
THE SPACECRAFT THEY DEVELOPED
AND PUBLISHED IN THEIR PAPER

00:08:16.333 --> 00:08:20.300
WAS PRETTY BIG,
AROUND 54,000 METRIC TONS.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.866
AND YOU KIND OF SEE
A PHOTO THERE

00:08:21.866 --> 00:08:26.100
THAT COMPARES TO THE "DAEDELUS"
TO THE SATURN V ROCKET

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.333
TO SCALE.

00:08:27.333 --> 00:08:28.800
AND I'VE ALSO INTERPOSED

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.900
A PICTURE OF THE INTERNATIONAL
SPACE STATION AS A COMPARISON.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.933
AND SO I SAT ON CONSOLE
FOR ALMOST ALL THE MISSIONS

00:08:35.933 --> 00:08:37.500
THAT BUILT THE
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION,

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.033
AND IT TOOK ALL THE RESOURCES

00:08:39.033 --> 00:08:41.366
OF ALL THE MAJOR
SPACE-FARING NATIONS

00:08:41.366 --> 00:08:44.100
OVER TEN YEARS
TO ASSEMBLE THE SPACE STATION.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.733
AND THAT'S ONLY 450 TONS.

00:08:45.733 --> 00:08:49.166
SO THAT'S OVER 100 TIMES
MORE MASS

00:08:49.166 --> 00:08:51.633
THAN THE INTERNATIONAL
SPACE STATION.

00:08:51.633 --> 00:08:54.166
SO INTERSTELLAR FLIGHT
IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:59.633
AND CAN BE A VERY
TIME-CONSUMING PURSUIT.

00:08:59.633 --> 00:09:01.633
SO YOU COULD ASK THE QUESTION:

00:09:01.633 --> 00:09:03.400
WHAT IF YOU WANTED TO GET
SOMEWHERE VERY QUICKLY?

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.066
WHAT IF YOU WANTED TO TRY
AND COVER THAT DISTANCE

00:09:06.066 --> 00:09:07.966
FROM ALPHA CENTAURI
IN SOME TIME PERIOD

00:09:07.966 --> 00:09:12.266
THAT'S NOT MEASURED IN DECADES,
CENTURIES, OR MILLENNIA?

00:09:12.266 --> 00:09:16.833
WHAT IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE IT
IN LESS THAN FOUR YEARS?

00:09:16.833 --> 00:09:19.500
IT TURNS OUT
THAT THE SAME FRAMEWORK

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.933
THAT ESTABLISHES
THE SPEED LIMIT,

00:09:21.933 --> 00:09:23.500
THE COSMIC SPEED LIMIT--

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.700
YOU CANNOT EXCEED
THE SPEED OF LIGHT.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.266
THERE ARE TWO LOOPHOLES

00:09:27.266 --> 00:09:30.600
WITHIN THE MATHEMATICS
OF GENERAL RELATIVITY

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.266
THAT POTENTIALLY ALLOW YOU
TO GO SOMEWHERE VERY QUICKLY

00:09:34.266 --> 00:09:37.666
WITHOUT LOCALLY
LEAVING YOUR LOCAL LIGHT CONE.

00:09:37.666 --> 00:09:39.800
ONE IS THE IDEA OF A WORMHOLE,

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.166
AND THE OTHER IS THE IDEA
OF A SPACEWARP.

00:09:41.166 --> 00:09:44.033
AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT THAT.

00:09:44.033 --> 00:09:46.200
SO THE IDEA OF A SPACEWARP
WORKS ON THE PRINCIPLE

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.366
THAT YOU EXPAND AND CONTRACT
SPACE AT ANY SPEED.

00:09:49.366 --> 00:09:52.766
IT'S NOT RESTRICTED TO "C."

00:09:52.766 --> 00:09:55.933
WE KNOW THAT INFLATION OCCURS
IN NATURE.

00:09:55.933 --> 00:09:58.866
WHEN WE LOOK AT LIGHT
THAT COMES TO US

00:09:58.866 --> 00:10:02.133
FROM STARS THAT ARE IN GALAXIES
VERY FAR AWAY FROM US,

00:10:02.133 --> 00:10:05.533
THAT LIGHT HAS BEEN RED-SHIFTED
SINCE THE BIG BANG

00:10:05.533 --> 00:10:08.100
13.7 BILLION YEARS AGO.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.633
SO WE KNOW THAT INFLATION
IS A REAL PHENOMENON,

00:10:10.633 --> 00:10:13.366
AND IT'S PART
OF GENERAL RELATIVITY.

00:10:13.366 --> 00:10:14.966
AND SO NATURE CAN DO IT.

00:10:14.966 --> 00:10:17.566
CAN WE DO IT
IN SOME PURPOSEFUL WAY?

00:10:17.566 --> 00:10:21.133
AND SO IT WAS THIS IDEA
THAT MOTIVATED MIGUEL ALCUBIERRE

00:10:21.133 --> 00:10:24.400
TO PUBLISH A PAPER IN THE '90s

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.266
THAT KIND OF CAPTURED THIS IDEA
IN MATHEMATICS.

00:10:27.266 --> 00:10:30.833
AND YOU SEE THE CONCEPT HERE
ON THE SCREEN.

00:10:30.833 --> 00:10:32.366
AND SO, WHEN YOU LOOK
AT THE MATH

00:10:32.366 --> 00:10:35.600
AND YOU TRY AND ENVISION
WHAT IT MIGHT REQUIRE,

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.333
YOU SEE A LITTLE
SURFACE PLOT THERE

00:10:37.333 --> 00:10:40.366
THAT REPRESENTS THE EXPANSION
AND CONTRACTION OF SPACE.

00:10:40.366 --> 00:10:44.033
SPACE IS CONTRACTING HERE
IN THE FRONT OF THE SPACECRAFT.

00:10:44.033 --> 00:10:47.266
AND SPACE IS EXPANDING HERE
IN THE BACK.

00:10:47.266 --> 00:10:49.233
WHEN YOU LOOK
AT THE ENERGY DENSITY TERM,

00:10:49.233 --> 00:10:50.433
YOU END UP WITH A SPACECRAFT

00:10:50.433 --> 00:10:54.566
THAT HAS THIS DONUT
TYPE OF APPARATUS

00:10:54.566 --> 00:10:58.333
THAT SURROUNDS THIS LITTLE
FOOTBALL-SHAPED SPACECRAFT.

00:10:58.333 --> 00:10:59.800
AND SO THE FOOTBALL SHAPE

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.600
MIGHT BE WHERE YOU'D HAVE
YOUR SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTATION

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.700
OR ANY PAYLOAD
THAT YOU'RE VERY WORRIED ABOUT,

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.266
OR IF YOU WANTED TO BE BOLD,

00:11:09.266 --> 00:11:13.733
MAYBE SOME TYPE
OF A HUMAN CREW.

00:11:13.733 --> 00:11:16.500
NOW, THE METRIC HAD A LOT OF
GOOD, APPEALING CHARACTERISTICS

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.533
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE IDEA.

00:11:18.533 --> 00:11:20.833
THAT LITTLE CENTER AREA,

00:11:20.833 --> 00:11:23.800
THAT BLUE DISC
YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN,

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.333
IT HAS A COUPLE
OF GOOD CHARACTERISTICS

00:11:26.333 --> 00:11:28.700
FOR THE CONCEPT
OF A MISSION LIKE THIS.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.533
IT HAS--
THE DIVERGENCE OF PHI IS ZERO.

00:11:31.533 --> 00:11:34.833
SO THE--
IT HAS FLAT SPACE-TIME

00:11:34.833 --> 00:11:36.000
INSIDE OF THE BUBBLE.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.233
THE COORDINATE TIME
IS EQUAL TO PROPER TIME

00:11:38.233 --> 00:11:40.366
INSIDE OF THAT FLAT REGION.

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:43.733
SO THE MISSION CONTROL CLOCKS
WOULD BE SYNCHRONIZED

00:11:43.733 --> 00:11:46.333
WITH THE CLOCKS
ONBOARD THE SPACECRAFT.

00:11:46.333 --> 00:11:48.833
THEN THE PROPER
ACCELERATION ALPHA IN THE BUBBLE

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:50.666
IS FORMALLY ZERO.

00:11:50.666 --> 00:11:55.666
SO WHEN YOU TURNED ON
THE SPACEWARP SYSTEM,

00:11:55.666 --> 00:11:58.366
THE WHOLE CREW WOULD NOT FEEL
AN INFINITE ACCELERATION

00:11:58.366 --> 00:12:00.400
AND GO SMACKING
AGAINST THE BULKHEAD

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.766
AND KILLING EVERYBODY ONBOARD

00:12:02.766 --> 00:12:08.233
AND MAKING FOR A VERY SAD
EPISODE OF "STAR TREK."

00:12:08.233 --> 00:12:11.600
NOW, IT DOES HAVE ONE
UNAPPEALING CHARACTERISTIC.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.833
AFTER MIGUEL PUBLISHED HIS PAPER

00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:15.700
AND PEOPLE WENT TO GO TRY
AND FIGURE OUT,

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.033
"HOW MUCH STUFF WOULD IT TAKE
TO MAKE THIS CONCEPT WORK?"

00:12:19.033 --> 00:12:21.666
BECAUSE IT REQUIRES
EXOTIC MATTER

00:12:21.666 --> 00:12:23.600
OR NEGATIVE VACUUM ENERGY.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.900
AND SO THEY DID
SOME CALCULATIONS TO FIGURE OUT,

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.133
"WHAT WOULD YOU NEED
TO MAKE SOME TYPE OF A SYSTEM

00:12:29.133 --> 00:12:31.200
THAT WE WOULD THINK ABOUT
ACTUALLY WORK?"

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.000
AND SO THE BEST ESTIMATES
THAT WERE DONE PRIOR TO 2011

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.733
WERE DONE BY SOME COLLEAGUES
OF MINE,

00:12:36.733 --> 00:12:39.633
DR. RICHARD OBOUSY
AND DR. JERRY CLEAVER.

00:12:39.633 --> 00:12:42.366
THEY REDUCED THE AMOUNT
OF STUFF THAT'S REQUIRED

00:12:42.366 --> 00:12:46.033
TO SOMETHING THAT'S
ABOUT THE SIZE OF JUPITER.

00:12:46.033 --> 00:12:49.100
AND SO THAT'S JUST
QUITE IMPRACTICAL.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.566
AND SO THE CONCEPT
WAS REALLY CONSIDERED

00:12:51.566 --> 00:12:53.466
MAYBE NATURE CAN DO IT
ON A GRAND SCALE,

00:12:53.466 --> 00:12:57.366
BUT IT'S UNLIKELY THAT WE COULD
EVER DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS

00:12:57.366 --> 00:13:00.266
IN A PURPOSEFUL SENSE.

00:13:00.266 --> 00:13:02.266
AND SO I GOT ASKED TO COME

00:13:02.266 --> 00:13:04.300
TO THE 100 YEAR
STARSHIP SYMPOSIUM

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.966
AND GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF A TALK
ON THE CONCEPT OF A SPACEWARP.

00:13:07.966 --> 00:13:11.000
SO, AS A RESULT OF PETE WORDEN
AND SOME OTHERS

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.333
KIND OF BEING VISIONARY

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:15.366
AND ASKING FOR FOLKS
TO KIND OF THINK ABOUT THIS

00:13:15.366 --> 00:13:17.200
RATHER THAN JUST KIND OF
RELAY EVERYTHING

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.400
THAT HAD BEEN DONE BEFORE
BY MYSELF AND OTHERS,

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.900
I DECIDED TO DO
A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.600
I WANTED TO LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS
TO THE MATHEMATICS

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.966
WHEN I CHANGE
SOME OF THE INPUT PARAMETERS.

00:13:29.966 --> 00:13:32.766
AND SO I LOOKED AT
AND FOCUSED ON, IN THIS CASE,

00:13:32.766 --> 00:13:35.633
THE SHELL THICKNESS PARAMETER.

00:13:35.633 --> 00:13:37.266
AND SO YOU SEE
A COUPLE OF STILLS THERE

00:13:37.266 --> 00:13:39.833
FROM SOME VIDEOS WE'LL LOOK AT
IN JUST A SECOND.

00:13:39.833 --> 00:13:44.133
SO THIS IS FOR
A 10-METER DIAMETER SPACECRAFT

00:13:44.133 --> 00:13:47.433
WITH AN EFFECTIVE VELOCITY
OF 10C.

00:13:47.433 --> 00:13:48.533
AND THE ONLY THING I'M CHANGING

00:13:48.533 --> 00:13:51.100
IS THE SHELL THICKNESS
PARAMETER,

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.833
SO, INSTEAD OF HAVING
THAT FOOTBALL

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:56.000
WITH THE RING
THAT GOES AROUND IT,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.533
INSTEAD OF THAT RING,
BEING A VERY THIN ASPECT RATIO

00:13:59.533 --> 00:14:01.166
OF, SAY, LIKE A WEDDING BAND,

00:14:01.166 --> 00:14:02.366
IF I CHANGE IT WHERE IT LOOKS

00:14:02.366 --> 00:14:05.733
MORE LIKE A LIFESAVER
OR AN INNER TUBE,

00:14:05.733 --> 00:14:09.233
I CAN GREATLY CHANGE
THE MAGNITUDE OF THE YORK TIME.

00:14:09.233 --> 00:14:12.166
AND TO KIND OF PUT THAT
IN ENGINEERING PARLANCE,

00:14:12.166 --> 00:14:17.100
KIND OF LIKE A STRAIN RATE,
SO TO SPEAK, ON SPACE-TIME.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.166
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ENERGY
DENSITY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT,

00:14:20.166 --> 00:14:23.733
THE ENERGY DENSITY
CHANGES SIGNIFICANTLY.

00:14:23.733 --> 00:14:26.566
SO JUST SHOW YOU SOME OF
THE ANIMATIONS TO HELP YOU SEE.

00:14:26.566 --> 00:14:30.066
SO, AS THE THICKNESS
OF THE BUBBLE GETS THICKER,

00:14:30.066 --> 00:14:31.733
BECAUSE THE RING
IS GETTING THICKER,

00:14:31.733 --> 00:14:35.766
THE MAGNITUDE OF THE YORK TIME
DECREASES SIGNIFICANTLY.

00:14:35.766 --> 00:14:38.133
AND SIMILARLY,
FOR THE ENERGY DENSITY,

00:14:38.133 --> 00:14:39.533
FOR THAT SAME SET OF CASES,

00:14:39.533 --> 00:14:43.666
THE ENERGY DENSITY COLLAPSES
MANY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE.

00:14:43.666 --> 00:14:46.566
SO WHAT'S POTENTIALLY GOING ON
WITH THIS FINDING

00:14:46.566 --> 00:14:49.800
IS THAT, BY CHANGING
THE STRAIN RATE

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.166
THAT WE'RE HAVING
TO PUT ON SPACE-TIME,

00:14:51.166 --> 00:14:53.266
WE'RE CHANGING
HOW MUCH ENERGY IS REQUIRED

00:14:53.266 --> 00:14:55.266
TO ACHIEVE THAT STRAIN RATE.

00:14:55.266 --> 00:14:56.900
SO IF I WERE TO--

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.666
THIS PODIUM IS MADE OUT OF WOOD,

00:14:58.666 --> 00:15:01.333
AND SO IT'S ABOUT, I DON'T KNOW,
3/4 OF AN INCH THICK.

00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:04.266
IF I WERE TO TRY AND TAKE
MY THUMB AND MY FOREFINGER

00:15:04.266 --> 00:15:06.900
AND COMPRESS THE WOOD,

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.833
AGAIN USING
AN ENGINEERING EXAMPLE,

00:15:08.833 --> 00:15:11.866
COMPRESS THE WOOD
BY A QUARTER INCH,

00:15:11.866 --> 00:15:13.066
YOU KNOW, I--

00:15:13.066 --> 00:15:14.633
ALTHOUGH I'M FROM TEXAS,
I CAN'T DO THAT.

00:15:14.633 --> 00:15:16.533
MAYBE PETE CAN, BUT...

00:15:16.533 --> 00:15:18.100
IT'S BEYOND MY CAPACITY.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.300
BUT IF I REDUCE THE STRAIN
THAT I HAVE TO PUT ON THE WOOD

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.933
TO MAYBE JUST A NANOMETER
OR TWO,

00:15:22.933 --> 00:15:24.333
THEN MAYBE I COULD DO THAT.

00:15:24.333 --> 00:15:25.666
SO THAT'S KIND OF
WHAT YOU'RE SEEING THERE,

00:15:25.666 --> 00:15:29.366
IS, BY CHANGING THE STRAIN RATE
FOR THE SAME CASE,

00:15:29.366 --> 00:15:31.700
WE ARE REDUCING THE ENERGY
THAT'S REQUIRED.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:35.233
NOW, GOING BACK JUST TO
POINT SOMETHING OUT HERE,

00:15:35.233 --> 00:15:38.100
THE--YOU'RE SACRIFICING
SOME REAL ESTATE

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.900
IN THE CENTER OF THE BUBBLE.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.533
SO YOU SEE
THAT LITTLE FLAT ISLAND

00:15:41.533 --> 00:15:43.033
WHERE THOSE IDEAL CONDITIONS ARE

00:15:43.033 --> 00:15:44.866
IS CHANGING ITS OVERALL SIZE.

00:15:44.866 --> 00:15:46.900
SO IT IS A LITTLE BIT
OF A TRADE.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.566
HOW MUCH VOLUME DO YOU NEED

00:15:48.566 --> 00:15:51.666
TO HOUSE WHATEVER
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO

00:15:51.666 --> 00:15:54.466
IN SOME FICTIONAL SPACECRAFT?

00:15:54.466 --> 00:15:55.966
NOW, SPACE-TIME
IS PRETTY STIFF.

00:15:55.966 --> 00:15:59.366
THIS WOOD IS
A FAIRLY STIFF MATERIAL.

00:15:59.366 --> 00:16:01.566
IF I COULD CHANGE
THE MATERIAL PROPERTIES

00:16:01.566 --> 00:16:05.600
AND MAKE THE WOOD SEEM
MORE LIKE A FOAM,

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.600
THEN, FOR THE SAME STRAIN RATE,

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.500
I CAN FURTHER REDUCE
THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.133
THAT'S NECESSARY
TO INDUCE THE AMOUNT OF STRAIN

00:16:13.133 --> 00:16:15.166
ON THAT PIECE OF MATERIAL.

00:16:15.166 --> 00:16:17.233
SO THE QUESTION
THAT I LOOKED AT NEXT:

00:16:17.233 --> 00:16:18.766
IS THERE SOMETHING
THAT WE CAN DO

00:16:18.766 --> 00:16:22.466
TO TRY AND LOOK AT THIS TERM
THAT'S IN THE EINSTEIN TENSOR,

00:16:22.466 --> 00:16:24.566
IN THE ENERGY DENSITY TENSOR.

00:16:24.566 --> 00:16:26.233
AND SO,
WHAT I DID NEXT

00:16:26.233 --> 00:16:29.266
WAS LOOK AT EXPANDING
THE ALCUBIERRE METRIC

00:16:29.266 --> 00:16:32.100
INTO A HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL
MANIFOLD.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.833
AND SO I LOOKED
AT THE CHUNG-FREESE METRIC

00:16:34.833 --> 00:16:37.300
AND DID SOME WORK WITH SOME
OF THE NULL-LIKE GEODESICS

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.366
BETWEEN THE TWO MODELS

00:16:39.366 --> 00:16:43.400
AND FOUND THAT
IF YOU WERE TO GO THROUGH

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.166
AND VARY THE INTENSITY
IN THE RING,

00:16:47.166 --> 00:16:49.566
YOU CAN CHANGE THE STIFFNESS
PROPERTIES OF SPACE

00:16:49.566 --> 00:16:53.366
AND POTENTIALLY FURTHER REDUCE
THE AMOUNT OF STUFF

00:16:53.366 --> 00:16:59.500
THAT'S NECESSARY
TO MAYBE MAKE THIS CONCEPT WORK.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.933
SO I CULMINATED THE EFFORT
WITH A TABLE

00:17:02.933 --> 00:17:06.233
THAT KIND OF LOOKED AT THIS
10-METER DIAMETER SPACECRAFT,

00:17:06.233 --> 00:17:08.566
VARYING THE SHELL
THICKNESS PARAMETER

00:17:08.566 --> 00:17:12.066
AND THE TIME-VARYING POTENTIAL,
D-PHI/DT.

00:17:12.066 --> 00:17:15.300
AND I WANTED
TO DUPLICATE THE WORK

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.433
DONE BY RICHARD OBOUSY
AND JERRY CLEAVER,

00:17:17.433 --> 00:17:23.333
SO I SET THE PARAMETERS
SUCH THAT I COULD REQUIRE

00:17:23.333 --> 00:17:26.900
A JUPITER AMOUNT
OF EXOTIC MATTER UP HERE.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.400
SO YOU CAN SEE ON THE BOTTOM
THERE'S SOME LITTLE CARTOONS

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:33.333
THAT SHOW THE RELATIVE
ASPECT RATIO OF THE RING

00:17:33.333 --> 00:17:36.866
RELATIVE TO THE LITTLE
LOG SCALE HERE.

00:17:36.866 --> 00:17:38.233
AND AS YOU GET FURTHER
TO THE LEFT,

00:17:38.233 --> 00:17:40.933
THE RING IS GETTING
INFINITELY THIN.

00:17:40.933 --> 00:17:42.033
AND SO WE CAN--

00:17:42.033 --> 00:17:43.433
FOR THIS 10-METER DIAMETER
SPACECRAFT

00:17:43.433 --> 00:17:45.400
WITH AN EFFECTIVE VELOCITY
OF 10C,

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.833
I CAN YIELD A SOLUTION

00:17:46.833 --> 00:17:49.766
THAT REQUIRES A JUPITER AMOUNT
OF EXOTIC MATTER.

00:17:49.766 --> 00:17:52.400
I COULD FORMALLY DRIVE IT
TO INFINITY.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.966
BUT BY USING THESE
OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES,

00:17:54.966 --> 00:17:57.733
WE CAN REDUCE IT,
NONTRIVIALLY,

00:17:57.733 --> 00:17:59.300
TO, IN THIS CASE,

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.833
SOMETHING ABOUT THE SIZE
OF THE "VOYAGER 1" SPACECRAFT

00:18:01.833 --> 00:18:04.033
IN TERMS OF THE EFFECTIVE MASS

00:18:04.033 --> 00:18:06.266
OF WHAT YOU NEED
TO MAKE THE TRICK WORK.

00:18:06.266 --> 00:18:08.233
SO, WHAT THIS DOES IS,

00:18:08.233 --> 00:18:10.266
IT MOVES THE IDEA
FROM THE CATEGORY

00:18:10.266 --> 00:18:12.333
OF COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE

00:18:12.333 --> 00:18:13.533
TO MAYBE PLAUSIBLE.

00:18:13.533 --> 00:18:15.866
IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT FEASIBLE.

00:18:15.866 --> 00:18:18.366
SO, UNFORTUNATELY, THAT POINT
USUALLY GETS MISSED A LOT.

00:18:18.366 --> 00:18:20.233
BUT AT LEAST
IT OPENS UP THE DOOR

00:18:20.233 --> 00:18:21.433
THAT MAYBE IT'S INTERESTING

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:23.933
TO GO TRY AND PERFORM
SOME SMALL EXPERIMENTS

00:18:23.933 --> 00:18:26.100
TO TRY AND SEE IF WE CAN CREATE

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.233
SOME TYPE OF CHANGES
IN OPTICAL PROPERTIES

00:18:28.233 --> 00:18:30.500
IN A VERY SMALL SCALE
IN THE LABORATORY.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:31.866
AND SO THAT'S SOME OF THE STUFF

00:18:31.866 --> 00:18:34.666
WE'RE KIND OF ROLLING THE ROCK
DOWN THE ROAD WITH

00:18:34.666 --> 00:18:35.933
AT OUR LAB AT JSC.

00:18:35.933 --> 00:18:41.066
AND SO WE'VE GOT TWO APPARATUSES
THAT WE USE.

00:18:41.066 --> 00:18:46.666
WE HAVE A TWYMAN-GREEN
INTERFEROMETER.

00:18:46.666 --> 00:18:48.500
AND SO THIS IS WHERE
WE HAVE A TEST ARTICLE

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.866
THAT WE PUT ON ONE
OF THE REFERENCE LEGS

00:18:50.866 --> 00:18:52.333
OF THE INTERFEROMETER,

00:18:52.333 --> 00:18:54.133
AND WE CAN ENERGIZE
THE TEST ARTICLE

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:55.866
TO TRY AND CREATE A--

00:18:55.866 --> 00:18:58.433
IN THIS CASE, WITH OUR
LOW-FIDELITY TEST ARTICLES,

00:18:58.433 --> 00:19:02.400
CREATE A BLUE-SHIFTED FRAME
RELATIVE TO THE LAB

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.466
AND CHANGE THE PERCEIVED
PATH LENGTH

00:19:04.466 --> 00:19:06.133
FOR THE PHOTONS
THAT MOVE THROUGH THIS REGION

00:19:06.133 --> 00:19:07.600
ON THE INTERFEROMETER.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.366
AND SO THERE'LL BE
A SLIGHT CHANGE

00:19:09.366 --> 00:19:12.333
IN THE INTERFERENCE PATTERN
ON THE INTERFEROMETER

00:19:12.333 --> 00:19:15.066
THAT WE CAN TRY AND DETECT

00:19:15.066 --> 00:19:18.000
USING SOME OF THE SOFTWARE
ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.400
AND MAYBE SEE IF WE CAN'T SEE
A MANIFESTATION OF THIS

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.833
IN A VERY SMALL SENSE.

00:19:23.833 --> 00:19:27.233
THIS SHOWS A PICTURE
OF ONE OF THE TEST SETUPS

00:19:27.233 --> 00:19:28.833
ON THE TWYMAN-GREEN.

00:19:28.833 --> 00:19:31.966
SEE THE TEST ARTICLE THERE
ON ONE OF THE BEAM PATHS.

00:19:31.966 --> 00:19:34.000
YOU'VE GOT THE LASER
ON THE LEFT.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.533
IT'S A VERY STANDARD SETUP
FOR A TWYMAN-GREEN.

00:19:36.533 --> 00:19:37.866
WE'VE GOT THE DETECTOR
ON THE RIGHT

00:19:37.866 --> 00:19:41.133
THAT GOES THROUGH THE COMPUTER
THAT COLLECTS THE DATA

00:19:41.133 --> 00:19:44.033
FOR THE DATA RUNS.

00:19:44.033 --> 00:19:46.333
AND THEN THE OTHER TEST SETUP
THAT WE HAVE

00:19:46.333 --> 00:19:47.666
IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
PERMUTATION

00:19:47.666 --> 00:19:48.700
ON THE INTERFEROMETER.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.400
WE HAVE A FABRY-PEROT
INTERFEROMETER.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.666
AND SO THE ADVANTAGE
OF A FABRY-PEROT INTERFEROMETER

00:19:53.666 --> 00:19:55.533
OVER A TWYMAN-GREEN

00:19:55.533 --> 00:19:58.000
IS THAT YOU CAN
PASS A LIGHT BEAM

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.833
THROUGH A PARTICULAR REGION
OF INTEREST MANY, MANY TIMES.

00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:04.866
AND SO, THAT INCREASES
THE MEASURED MAGNITUDE

00:20:04.866 --> 00:20:08.566
OF THE EFFECT BY A COUPLE
OF ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE.

00:20:08.566 --> 00:20:11.600
SO IT'S A WAY TO TAKE
A TEST IMPLEMENTATION

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.900
AND GET TO A LITTLE BIT HIGHER
LEVEL OF FIDELITY.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.100
AND SO YOU CAN SEE ON
THE BOTTOM TWO PICTURES THERE,

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.533
THERE'S AN EXAMPLE
OF A SODIUM SOURCE

00:20:21.533 --> 00:20:23.466
BEING RUN THROUGH
A MICHELSON-MORLEY TYPE

00:20:23.466 --> 00:20:25.200
OF INTERFEROMETER.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.866
YOU CAN SEE
THE INTERFERENCE PATTERN.

00:20:27.866 --> 00:20:30.200
BUT IN THE FABRY-PEROT,

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.200
BECAUSE OF THESE MULTIPLE
CONSTRUCTIVE AND DESTRUCTIVE

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.100
INTERFERENCE PASSES,

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.066
YOU START TO SEE
THE ATOMIC STRUCTURE

00:20:38.066 --> 00:20:39.933
OF THE SODIUM SOURCE,

00:20:39.933 --> 00:20:42.566
AND SO YOU SEE THE DOUBLET
IN THE FABRY-PEROT.

00:20:42.566 --> 00:20:44.266
AND SO YOU SEE
A TEST SETUP THERE

00:20:44.266 --> 00:20:47.033
WITH THE LASER AND THE IMAGER
AND THEN THE FABRY-PEROT.

00:20:47.033 --> 00:20:48.633
THAT'S IN THE REGION

00:20:48.633 --> 00:20:51.033
WHERE WE WERE TRYING TO INDUCE
THE BLUE-SHIFTED FRAME

00:20:51.033 --> 00:20:54.033
WITH THE LOW-FIDELITY
TEST ARTICLE.

00:20:54.033 --> 00:20:55.533
NOW, THE PROCESS
OF DOING THE TEST--

00:20:55.533 --> 00:20:57.900
WE DO TURN THE TEST ARTICLE
ON AND OFF

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.466
WITH A GIVEN FREQUENCY,

00:20:59.466 --> 00:21:01.400
AND WE GO THROUGH INFOR--

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.833
YOU SEE AN IMAGE
ON THE TOP RIGHT

00:21:02.833 --> 00:21:06.900
THAT SHOWS AN INTERFERENCE
PATTERN FROM THE IMAGER.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.466
AND WE'LL GO THROUGH
AND RUN A TEST CYCLE

00:21:08.466 --> 00:21:11.933
WHERE WE RUN IT
OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.

00:21:11.933 --> 00:21:15.966
AND THEN WE WILL DO AN FFT
FOR EACH AND EVERY PIXEL,

00:21:15.966 --> 00:21:19.100
AND THEN WE WILL LOOK
FOR ENERGY IN THE SPECTRUM

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.266
BASED ON HOW WE WERE ENERGIZING
AND DE-ENERGIZING

00:21:22.266 --> 00:21:24.033
THE TEST ARTICLE.

00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:25.766
AND YOU SEE ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT,

00:21:25.766 --> 00:21:28.400
THAT IS AN FFT
OF THE ENTIRE IMAGER--

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.000
THE FREQUENCY OF INTEREST.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.433
IF THERE WERE
NO PHENOMENA PRESENT,

00:21:33.433 --> 00:21:34.700
THEN, IN PRINCIPLE,

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:37.533
THAT SHOULD JUST SIMPLY BE
A FLAT, BLUE SURFACE.

00:21:37.533 --> 00:21:39.800
WE SHOULDN'T SEE ANYTHING THERE.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.233
HOWEVER, THERE ARE STILL--

00:21:41.233 --> 00:21:42.900
WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH STUFF
OF THIS MAGNITUDE,

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.300
THERE ARE STILL FALSE POSITIVES.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.366
SO WE WOULD, BY NO MEANS,
CONSIDER THIS DEFINITIVE.

00:21:47.366 --> 00:21:48.600
THIS IS JUST INTERESTING,

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.100
AND WE'RE CONTINUING
TO TRY AND ELIMINATE

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.866
OTHER SOURCES
OF FALSE POSITIVES.

00:21:54.866 --> 00:21:58.266
NOW, WE HAVE--
THERE'S A LAB AT JSC

00:21:58.266 --> 00:22:00.700
THAT WAS BUILT
FOR THE APOLLO PROGRAM

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.533
WORKING WITH
INERTIAL MEASUREMENT UNITS.

00:22:03.533 --> 00:22:06.666
WE KIND OF WERE ABLE

00:22:06.666 --> 00:22:08.866
TO GET A LITTLE
SMALL FOOTPRINT IN THAT LAB

00:22:08.866 --> 00:22:11.633
TO BE ABLE TO DO SOME WORK
AND TAKE ADVANTAGE

00:22:11.633 --> 00:22:14.200
OF THE SEISMIC ISOLATION
THAT IT HAS.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.700
YOU CAN SEE THE BIG
PNEUMATIC PIERS

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.833
THAT FLOATS THAT ENTIRE FLOOR.

00:22:18.833 --> 00:22:20.166
IT'S A PRETTY SIZABLE LAB,

00:22:20.166 --> 00:22:23.266
PROBABLY ABOUT
30 FEET BY 40 FEET,

00:22:23.266 --> 00:22:24.533
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:22:24.533 --> 00:22:25.966
AND SO WE CAN FLOAT
THE WHOLE LAB

00:22:25.966 --> 00:22:27.300
WHEN WE'RE DOING TESTING.

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.433
AND ALTHOUGH THE LAB,
WITHOUT BEING FLOATED,

00:22:29.433 --> 00:22:31.866
IS PRETTY SEISMICALLY QUIET,

00:22:31.866 --> 00:22:34.766
FLOATING IT DOES
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

00:22:34.766 --> 00:22:36.066
I WILL SAY THIS.

00:22:36.066 --> 00:22:39.900
WHEN WE FIRST BROUGHT THE LAB
OUT OF THE RETIREMENT--

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.933
EXCUSE ME--THE FLOATING LAB
OUT OF RETIREMENT,

00:22:41.933 --> 00:22:45.366
WE CLIMBED DOWN
INTO THE AREA THERE

00:22:45.366 --> 00:22:47.366
WHERE YOU SEE THE GENTLEMAN
UNDERNEATH THE FLOOR.

00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:51.633
WE FOUND A COUPLE OF SUITCASES
OF LUGGAGE DOWN THERE,

00:22:51.633 --> 00:22:53.366
AND WE WERE A LITTLE NERVOUS
WHEN WE PULLED THOSE UP

00:22:53.366 --> 00:22:56.800
AND WE OPENED THOSE,
WHAT MIGHT BE IN THOSE, BUT...

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.833
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THEM,

00:22:57.833 --> 00:23:00.833
SO IT WAS NOTHING EXCITING,
SO...

00:23:00.833 --> 00:23:04.233
SO, ANYWAY, THIS SHOWS
AN INTERFERENCE PATTERN

00:23:04.233 --> 00:23:07.900
WITH THE LAB ISOLATED
AND THE LAB NOT ISOLATED,

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.466
IN TERMS OF THAT FLOATING LAB.

00:23:09.466 --> 00:23:11.233
SO IT DOES MAKE
A LITTLE BIT OF DIFFERENCE

00:23:11.233 --> 00:23:14.633
IN THE QUALITY OF THE DATA
THAT WE COLLECT.

00:23:14.633 --> 00:23:16.166
BUT WE DO HAVE
BOTH OPTIONS OPEN,

00:23:16.166 --> 00:23:18.300
DEPENDING UPON
HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.666
BEFORE WE RUN A CAMPAIGN

00:23:19.666 --> 00:23:22.800
TO GET THE CENTER FOLKS OUT
TO FLOAT THE FLOOR.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.266
I WILL SAY THIS.

00:23:24.266 --> 00:23:26.866
THE FLOOR HAD NOT BEEN FLOATED
IN SUCH A LONG PERIOD OF TIME

00:23:26.866 --> 00:23:29.000
THAT APPARENTLY
THAT HAD CHANGED THE DOORS,

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.233
AND WHEN WE FLOATED THE FLOOR
THE FIRST TIME,

00:23:31.233 --> 00:23:32.766
IT ACTUALLY LOCKED US
IN THE ROOM,

00:23:32.766 --> 00:23:35.300
BECAUSE IT FLOATED UP ABOVE
WHERE THE DOORS COULDN'T OPEN,

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.566
SO IT WAS--ANYWAY...

00:23:38.566 --> 00:23:40.266
SO THE NEXT THING
WE'VE BEEN DOING

00:23:40.266 --> 00:23:43.666
IS TRYING TO GET AWAY
FROM AN ENCAPSULATED FABRY-PEROT

00:23:43.666 --> 00:23:46.500
AND GO TO AN OPEN-AIR
ETALON SET OF MIRRORS

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.400
WHERE POSITION THE MIRRORS

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.766
BASICALLY IN THE SAME
ORIENTATION THAT THEY WERE

00:23:50.766 --> 00:23:53.666
INSIDE OF THE ENCAPSULATED
FABRY-PEROT,

00:23:53.666 --> 00:23:57.066
JUST TRY TO GO THROUGH AND
ADDRESS SOME SOURCES OF MIMICRY

00:23:57.066 --> 00:23:59.766
TO MAKE SURE,
"IS THE SIGNAL STILL THERE?

00:23:59.766 --> 00:24:01.600
"CAN WE KILL THE SIGNAL

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:05.233
OR ATTRIBUTE IT
TO SOME BORING EXPLANATION?"

00:24:05.233 --> 00:24:07.466
SO WE WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS
OF TAKING A LOOK

00:24:07.466 --> 00:24:10.966
AT TESTING
WITH AN OPEN-AIR ETALON,

00:24:10.966 --> 00:24:14.700
AND WE STILL SEE SOME ENERGY
IN THE SPECTRUM

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.500
WHERE WE WOULD ANTICIPATE
TO SEE IT.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:22.900
BUT, AGAIN, THIS IS DEFINITELY
NOT DEFINITIVE, BY ANY STRETCH.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.100
ANOTHER WAY TO TEST
AT SOME POINT

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.366
TO MAYBE ALSO ADDRESS
OTHER SOURCES OF MIMICRY

00:24:28.366 --> 00:24:30.266
WOULD BE
A TIME-OF-FLIGHT APPROACH,

00:24:30.266 --> 00:24:33.900
WHERE WE COULD TAKE
A HELIUM-NEON LASER

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.100
AND WE COULD RUN IT
THROUGH AN OPTICAL CHOPPER

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.733
THAT WOULD CREATE LIGHT PULSES

00:24:37.733 --> 00:24:41.466
THAT WE COULD THEN SEND
THROUGH THIS RACETRACK

00:24:41.466 --> 00:24:45.466
AND TIME HOW LONG IT TAKES
FOR A PHOTON

00:24:45.466 --> 00:24:48.866
TO RUN THROUGH
THE TEST APPARATUS

00:24:48.866 --> 00:24:51.800
WITH A TEST DEVICE
NOT ENERGIZED,

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.033
AND THEN TIME HOW LONG IT TAKES
FOR A PHOTON

00:24:54.033 --> 00:24:56.266
TO RUN THROUGH
THE TEST APPARATUS

00:24:56.266 --> 00:24:59.600
WITH THE DEVICE OFF--OR ON,
BACK AND FORTH,

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:00.766
AND COMPARE THE TWO,

00:25:00.766 --> 00:25:02.400
AND THAT CAN BE A DIFFERENT WAY

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.833
OF DETECTING THE PHENOMENA.

00:25:04.833 --> 00:25:07.400
IF YOU SAW SOME DATA THAT LOOKED
LIKE WHAT YOU WANTED

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.766
ON THIS APPARATUS,

00:25:08.766 --> 00:25:10.633
IF YOU DIDN'T SEE
COMMENSURATE BEHAVIOR HERE,

00:25:10.633 --> 00:25:11.966
THAT MIGHT BE A WAY
FOR YOU TO SAY

00:25:11.966 --> 00:25:16.766
IT'S SOME OTHER,
BORING EXPLANATION.

00:25:16.766 --> 00:25:19.733
NOW, THE ONE THING THAT, TO ME--

00:25:19.733 --> 00:25:22.266
EVERYONE ALWAYS THINKS
ABOUT THE ROMANTIC VISION

00:25:22.266 --> 00:25:23.533
ON THE RIGHT, RIGHT,

00:25:23.533 --> 00:25:27.300
IN TERMS OF BEING ON THE BRIDGE
OF SOME SPACESHIP

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.833
GOING OFF TO DESTINATIONS
VERY, VERY FAR AWAY.

00:25:29.833 --> 00:25:33.000
AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT,

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.033
AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT KIND OF
MOTIVATES US IN SOME WAY,

00:25:37.033 --> 00:25:39.600
BUT, YOU KNOW, I ALSO LOOK AT,
HOW DO WE--

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.300
YOU KNOW, WHAT DO WE DO
TO GET OUT OF LOW EARTH ORBIT?

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.933
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO
TO SUPPORT AN ASTEROID MISSION

00:25:45.933 --> 00:25:47.266
IN A DISTANT RETROGRADE ORBIT?

00:25:47.266 --> 00:25:50.500
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO
TO GET OUT TO MARS?

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.766
AND SO, IN TERMS OF
INTERSTELLAR PRECURSORS, RIGHT,

00:25:52.766 --> 00:25:56.566
WE ONLY HAVE A SPACECRAFT
AT 120 A.U.,

00:25:56.566 --> 00:26:01.300
SO WHILE I TALKED ABOUT 10C

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.766
FOR SOME OF THE STUFF I DID
FOR THE CALCULATIONS,

00:26:04.766 --> 00:26:07.500
WHAT ABOUT 0.01C?

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.766
THAT'S A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER
VELOCITY COMPARED TO THAT,

00:26:10.766 --> 00:26:13.566
BUT COMPARED TO ANYTHING
WE'VE DONE TO DATE,

00:26:13.566 --> 00:26:15.500
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLY FAST.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.300
SO THAT MAY STILL HAVE
SOME INTEREST AT SOME POINT,

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.733
IF WE COULD EVER START
TO MATURE THIS

00:26:20.733 --> 00:26:24.900
PAST JUST THE CONCEPT
IN A LAB PERSPECTIVE.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:28.866
SO, YOU KNOW, IF WE WERE EVER
TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD,

00:26:28.866 --> 00:26:30.400
THAT'S SOMETHING, TO ME,

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.766
THAT I THINK THERE'D BE PLENTY
OF INTERESTING APPLICATIONS

00:26:32.766 --> 00:26:36.200
WITH SPEEDS LIKE THAT, SO...

00:26:38.833 --> 00:26:42.800
NOW, THIS WAS--THIS IS KIND OF
LIKE AN EDUCATION OUTREACH PIECE

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.100
THAT I DID WITH SOME FOLKS
FROM CBS.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:49.300
I WORKED WITH MIKE OKUDA
AND MARK RADEMAKER.

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:53.100
THE CONCEPT YOU SEE HERE
IS BASED ON SOME ARTWORK

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.266
THAT MATT JEFFRIES DID
BACK IN THE '60s

00:26:56.266 --> 00:26:57.966
FOR THE TV SHOW.

00:26:57.966 --> 00:26:59.066
HE'S THE GUY
THAT KIND OF CAME UP

00:26:59.066 --> 00:27:00.933
WITH THE FAMILIAR SOMBRERO LOOK

00:27:00.933 --> 00:27:03.900
THAT WE ALL KNOW
FROM THE TV SHOW.

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:07.166
AND SO HE HAD ANOTHER VERSION
THAT HE GENERATED

00:27:07.166 --> 00:27:09.600
THAT, I THINK,
WAS ONE OF HIS FAVORITE.

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.000
AND SO THIS IS
A MODERN RENDERING

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
DONE BY MARK RADEMAKER

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.833
BASED ON THAT ARTISTIC CONCEPT
THAT HE DEVELOPED.

00:27:18.833 --> 00:27:21.433
NOW, THE THING
THAT'S COOL TO ME IS,

00:27:21.433 --> 00:27:23.900
YOU KNOW, JUST GOING
THROUGH THE MATH WITH YOU GUYS,

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:27.333
YOU CAN SEE
THAT THIS CONCEPT IS--

00:27:27.333 --> 00:27:29.200
IT'S GOT SOME THINGS

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.500
THAT ARE ALMOST
WHAT THE MATHEMATICS REQUIRE.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.200
IT'S GOT THESE RINGS
THAT GO AROUND THE SPACECRAFT,

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.733
AND IT'S GOT THIS
CENTRALLY LOCATED SPACECRAFT.

00:27:37.733 --> 00:27:41.100
BUT IT DOES HAVE A FEW THINGS
THAT ARE NOT CORRECT,

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.600
BASED ON THE ENERGY
OPTIMIZATION FINDINGS

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.200
AND WHERE THE WORK BUBBLE
WOULD ACTUALLY BE.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.666
THE RINGS ON THIS SPACECRAFT
ARE TOO THIN,

00:27:49.666 --> 00:27:51.500
SO THEY'RE GONNA DRIVE
THE ENERGY REQUIREMENTS

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.366
TO BE NONTRIVIAL.

00:27:53.366 --> 00:27:55.833
SO YOU'D WANT THE RINGS
TO BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

00:27:55.833 --> 00:27:57.466
AND THEN THE CENTRAL PORTION
OF THE SPACECRAFT

00:27:57.466 --> 00:28:00.166
IS NOT LOCATED PROPERLY.

00:28:00.166 --> 00:28:02.233
AND SO, WHEN THE BUBBLE
WERE TO FORM,

00:28:02.233 --> 00:28:05.633
IT WOULD ACTUALLY CUT THE BRIDGE
OFF THE SPACECRAFT,

00:28:05.633 --> 00:28:06.866
AND THE BRIDGE WOULD FLOAT AWAY,

00:28:06.866 --> 00:28:10.633
AND SCOTTY WOULD
PROBABLY BE FIRED.

00:28:10.633 --> 00:28:13.266
SO I WORKED WITH THE GUYS
TO KIND OF UPGRADE THIS CONCEPT

00:28:13.266 --> 00:28:14.333
WITH THE MATHEMATICS,

00:28:14.333 --> 00:28:16.166
AND SO WE DID
AN EDUCATION OUTREACH

00:28:16.166 --> 00:28:17.833
FOR, LIKE,
A SHIPS OF THE LINE CALENDAR,

00:28:17.833 --> 00:28:20.766
WHERE WE HAD A LITTLE PARAGRAPH
THAT REMINDED PEOPLE,

00:28:20.766 --> 00:28:21.933
"WE'RE STILL IN LOW EARTH ORBIT.

00:28:21.933 --> 00:28:23.100
"WE'VE GOT A LOT
OF WORK TO GO DO.

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:25.000
"IF THIS IS INTERESTING TO YOU,

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.400
"THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER WORK
THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON,

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.200
"SO PLEASE FOLLOW YOUR PASSION

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.600
AND WORK ON SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS."

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.666
BUT THE CONCEPT'S GOT
THESE MUCH THICKER RINGS,

00:28:36.666 --> 00:28:39.300
SO THAT'S CONSIDERABLY
MORE ATHLETIC-LOOKING.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:43.200
AND THEN THE LITTLE SPACESHIP
IS KIND OF MORE PROPERLY LOCATED

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.933
WITHIN WHAT WOULD BE CALLED
THE FITTING REGION.

00:28:45.933 --> 00:28:47.600
SO IT'S IN THAT LITTLE
FLAT SPACE-TIME,

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:53.200
SO THINGS WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT
BETTER FOR THE CREW.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.366
NOW, AS WE MOVE FORWARD,
WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS,

00:28:55.366 --> 00:28:59.833
WE WANT TO MOVE TO
A HIGHER-FIDELITY TEST ARTICLE.

00:28:59.833 --> 00:29:02.733
SO YOU SEE A CONCEPT
WE'RE STILL WORKING ON RIGHT NOW

00:29:02.733 --> 00:29:05.433
IN TERMS OF SOME
OF THE ANALYSIS.

00:29:05.433 --> 00:29:08.133
WE WANT TO EXPLORE
THE D-PHI/DT DEPENDENCY.

00:29:08.133 --> 00:29:10.100
REMEMBER, I SAID THAT
THAT WAS ONE OF THE TWO

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.433
ENERGY OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES.

00:29:12.433 --> 00:29:13.433
AND SO WE WANT TO GO THROUGH

00:29:13.433 --> 00:29:16.633
AND EXPLORE
THE D-PHI/DT DEPENDENCY.

00:29:16.633 --> 00:29:18.600
AND SOME OF THE STUFF
THAT WE'RE DOING

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.866
WITH THE Q-THRUSTER TECHNOLOGY

00:29:19.866 --> 00:29:22.800
HAS SOME POTENTIAL PERTINENCE
TO THIS.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.200
AND SO WE'RE USING
THE PHYSICS MODELS FOR THAT

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.533
TO KIND OF GUIDE
THE CONSTRUCTION

00:29:28.533 --> 00:29:29.833
AND DEVELOPMENT
OF A TEST ARTICLE

00:29:29.833 --> 00:29:32.400
TO GO THROUGH AND SEE
IF WE CAN'T EXPLORE

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.300
A MUCH LARGER MAGNITUDE
OF D-PHI/DT.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.166
AND YOU KIND OF SEE
A LITTLE CARTOON

00:29:37.166 --> 00:29:38.466
OF SOME OF THE MODES
WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:29:38.466 --> 00:29:40.766
AND SOME OF THE SPECIFIC DETAILS
WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:29:40.766 --> 00:29:45.733
TO PUT ON THE INSIDE
OF THE TEST APPARATUS.

00:29:45.733 --> 00:29:47.066
SO THAT TAKES ME THROUGH
TO THE NEXT ONE.

00:29:47.066 --> 00:29:50.466
THAT'S KIND OF THE INTERSTELLAR
PORTION OF THE TALK.

00:29:50.466 --> 00:29:52.166
I WANT TO SWITCH GEARS NOW
AND TALK A LITTLE BIT

00:29:52.166 --> 00:29:55.166
ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY
THAT WE'RE WORKING ON.

00:29:55.166 --> 00:29:57.933
IT'S A LITTLE BIT HIGHER
IN TRL, POTENTIALLY.

00:29:57.933 --> 00:30:00.100
A CONCEPT CALLED Q-THRUSTERS.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:01.433
AND I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT SOME OF THE DATA

00:30:01.433 --> 00:30:04.900
THAT I PRESENTED AT
THE JOINT PROPULSION CONFERENCE

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.733
SEVERAL WEEKS AGO.

00:30:06.733 --> 00:30:09.366
SO A Q-THRUSTER IS A FORM
OF ELECTRIC PROPULSION

00:30:09.366 --> 00:30:10.733
ANALOGOUS TO A HALL THRUSTER,

00:30:10.733 --> 00:30:12.700
SO IT'S LOW-THRUST.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.466
IT USES ELECTRIC
AND MAGNETIC FIELDS

00:30:14.466 --> 00:30:16.033
TO WORK WITH CHARGED PARTICLES.

00:30:16.033 --> 00:30:20.066
IN THIS CASE, WE'RE WORKING
ON THE QUANTUM VACUUM,

00:30:20.066 --> 00:30:22.900
THE VIRTUAL ELECTRONS
AND POSITRONS,

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.500
PUSHING THEM IN ONE DIRECTION,

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:26.533
AND THE Q-THRUSTER RECOILS
IN THE OTHER DIRECTION

00:30:26.533 --> 00:30:28.100
TO CONSERVE MOMENTUM.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.933
SO A CLASSICAL ANALOGY
TO THINK ABOUT WITH THIS CONCEPT

00:30:31.933 --> 00:30:35.866
IS TO IMAGINE A SUBMARINE THAT
HAS A PROPELLER ON THE BACK.

00:30:35.866 --> 00:30:38.800
A SUBMARINE DOES NOT GO
TO ALL THE TROUBLE

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:43.033
TO PULL UP TO A DOCK
AND FILL UP A TANK FULL OF WATER

00:30:43.033 --> 00:30:45.466
AND THEN EXPEL THAT WATER
THROUGH A NOZZLE

00:30:45.466 --> 00:30:47.166
IN THE BACK OF THE SUBMARINE.

00:30:47.166 --> 00:30:49.533
IT CAPITALIZES ON THE FACT

00:30:49.533 --> 00:30:51.633
THAT IT'S EMBEDDED
IN ITS PROPELLANT.

00:30:51.633 --> 00:30:52.966
SO THE PROPELLANT
IS ALL AROUND IT

00:30:52.966 --> 00:30:54.266
IN THE FORM OF THE SEA WATER.

00:30:54.266 --> 00:30:56.766
SO IT USES THE PROPELLER
ON THE BACK OF THE SUBMARINE

00:30:56.766 --> 00:31:00.633
TO GENERATE A HYDRODYNAMIC
PRESSURE GRADIENT IN THE WATER,

00:31:00.633 --> 00:31:02.100
AND SO THE WATER MOVES
IN ONE DIRECTION,

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.466
AND THE SUBMARINE MOVES
IN THE OTHER.

00:31:03.466 --> 00:31:04.900
SO, ANALOGOUSLY,

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.733
A Q-THRUSTER IS PUSHING
OFF THE QUANTUM VACUUM,

00:31:07.733 --> 00:31:10.266
PUSHING THE QUANTUM PARTICLES
IN ONE DIRECTION,

00:31:10.266 --> 00:31:11.533
AND IN ORDER
TO CONSERVE MOMENTUM,

00:31:11.533 --> 00:31:14.266
THE Q-THRUSTER MOVES
IN THE OTHER DIRECTION.

00:31:14.266 --> 00:31:16.600
I LIKE THIS QUOTE
FROM ARTHUR C. CLARKE.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.966
THIS WAS DONE IN 1980,

00:31:17.966 --> 00:31:20.266
SO BACK WHEN I WAS
IN MIDDLE SCHOOL.

00:31:20.266 --> 00:31:22.566
"IF VACUUM FLUCTUATIONS
CAN BE HARNESSED FOR PROPULSION

00:31:22.566 --> 00:31:24.900
"BY ANYONE BESIDES
SCIENCE-FICTION WRITERS,

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.600
"THE PURELY ENGINEERING PROBLEMS
OF INTERSTELLAR FLIGHT

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.666
WOULD BE SOLVED."

00:31:28.666 --> 00:31:30.133
BUT I'D ALSO BE KEEN

00:31:30.133 --> 00:31:34.766
TO USE IT FOR MARS MISSIONS
AS WELL.

00:31:34.766 --> 00:31:37.766
THIS SHOWS OUR TEST APPARATUS
THAT WE USE

00:31:37.766 --> 00:31:40.833
TO MEASURE AND QUANTIFY
THE FORCE

00:31:40.833 --> 00:31:42.600
FOR THE TEST ARTICLES,

00:31:47.366 --> 00:31:49.533
THIS IS A LOW-THRUST
TORSION PENDULUM.

00:31:49.533 --> 00:31:52.533
IT HAS ALL THE SIMILAR ELEMENTS
THAT YOU WOULD FIND

00:31:52.533 --> 00:31:56.533
IN THE OTHER HIGH-FIDELITY
TORSION PENDULUMS THAT ARE USED

00:31:56.533 --> 00:32:00.766
BY THE AGENCY AND ACADEMIA
AND INDUSTRY.

00:32:00.766 --> 00:32:04.300
ON THE LEFT OVER HERE,

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.366
YOU SEE THESE THINGS
CALLED LINEAR FLEXURE BEARINGS.

00:32:07.366 --> 00:32:11.066
SO THESE ARE THESE TWO
LITTLE BOXES RIGHT HERE.

00:32:11.066 --> 00:32:13.800
THIS IS THE ACTUAL BAR
OF THE TORSION PENDULUM

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.900
THAT MOVES HORIZONTALLY
THIS WAY.

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:21.800
WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CABLES
ACROSS THE INTERFACE.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.600
THE INTERFACE
IS A CABLE-FREE INTERFACE.

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:27.700
WE USE LIQUID METAL CONTACTS
WITH A LIQUID GALLON STAND,

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:31.933
SO WE PASS DC POWER,
DIGITAL AND ANALOG DATA

00:32:31.933 --> 00:32:33.400
ACROSS THE INTERFACE.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.100
WE DO NOT PASS RF
ACROSS THE INTERFACE.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.133
WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE--
YOU'LL SEE IN A MINUTE,

00:32:38.133 --> 00:32:41.500
THE RF SOURCES ARE ACTUALLY
ON THE TORSION PENDULUM.

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.266
WE HAVE THE ABILITY
TO TEST DOWN TO VACUUM,

00:32:44.266 --> 00:32:46.333
TO A FEW MICROTORR.

00:32:46.333 --> 00:32:47.933
AND THEN THIS IS OUR--

00:32:47.933 --> 00:32:51.000
IN TERMS OF MEASURING
AND QUANTIFYING THE FORCE,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.566
THIS IS THE ELECTROSTATIC FIN
SYSTEM THAT WE USE

00:32:53.566 --> 00:32:56.733
TO INPUT A CALIBRATION FORCE.

00:32:56.733 --> 00:33:01.333
SO WE WOULD PUT IN A VOLTAGE
OF 100, 300 VOLTS,

00:33:01.333 --> 00:33:04.400
AND THE BENEFIT
OF USING ELECTROSTATIC FINS,

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.800
IT'S NON-CONTACT WAY
TO INPUT A FORCE

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.233
INTO THE TORSION PENDULUM.

00:33:08.233 --> 00:33:10.666
THE ADVANTAGE OF USING
THE ELECTROSTATIC FINS

00:33:10.666 --> 00:33:12.166
IS THAT THE FORCE IS CONSTANT,

00:33:12.166 --> 00:33:15.900
WHETHER YOU'RE 90% ENGAGED
OR 10% ENGAGED,

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.900
WHICH IS WHY IT'S USED
IN THIS PARTICULAR APPARATUS.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.100
SO WHEN YOU TURN
ON THE CALIBRATION FORCE,

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:23.933
IT STAYS CONSTANT.

00:33:23.933 --> 00:33:27.333
AND THEN WE MEASURE--

00:33:27.333 --> 00:33:28.566
WE MEASURE DISPLACEMENT

00:33:28.566 --> 00:33:31.166
USING THIS OPTICAL
DISPLACEMENT SENSOR HERE.

00:33:31.166 --> 00:33:32.633
AND SO THIS MEASURES
DISPLACEMENT

00:33:32.633 --> 00:33:33.966
AS A FUNCTION OF TIME,

00:33:33.966 --> 00:33:37.100
AND THEN, THAT WAY, WE CAN
INPUT A CALIBRATION FORCE,

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:40.466
WE CAN TEST
SOME TEST APPARATUS,

00:33:40.466 --> 00:33:43.200
AND THEN WE CAN QUANTIFY
WHAT TYPE OF FORCE WAS PRESENT

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.733
WHEN WE TESTED
THE TEST APPARATUS.

00:33:45.733 --> 00:33:48.066
AND THEN WE HAVE
A MAGNETIC DAMPER HERE

00:33:48.066 --> 00:33:52.433
THAT CONVERTS ROTATIONAL ENERGY
INTO HEAT ENERGY.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.633
SO ONE OF THE TESTS
THAT WE DID BACK IN AUGUST,

00:33:58.633 --> 00:34:03.000
WE PARTNERED WITH CANNAE
TO TEST A RF TEST ARTICLE

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.833
THAT THEY WERE KEEN TO EXPLORE,

00:34:05.833 --> 00:34:08.300
SOME DEPENDENCY
ON GENERATING THRUST

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:12.000
WITH THE PRESENCE OF SOME
OF THESE RADIAL GROOVES

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.866
THAT GO AROUND THE PERIPHERY
OF THE THRUSTER.

00:34:13.866 --> 00:34:17.433
SO YOU SEE, THIS IS A PICTURE
OF THE THRUSTER HERE.

00:34:17.433 --> 00:34:19.900
THIS IS A--KIND OF LIKE
AN IMAGINARY CUT

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.366
THROUGH THE CENTER
OF THAT THRUSTER.

00:34:22.366 --> 00:34:24.900
AND SO THESE RADIAL GROOVES
WOULD BE IN THE PERIPHERY

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.666
OF THIS BODY OF THE THRUSTER.

00:34:26.666 --> 00:34:30.866
THIS IS THE RF POWER INPUT,
AND THIS IS THE SENSE ANTENNA.

00:34:30.866 --> 00:34:33.833
SO THE CANNAE FOLKS FELT
THERE MIGHT BE SOME DEPENDENCY

00:34:33.833 --> 00:34:40.166
ON THE PRESENCE OF THE SLOTS
IN THE TEST ARTICLE.

00:34:40.166 --> 00:34:43.433
SO WE ASKED THEM TO BRING
A SLOTTED TEST ARTICLE

00:34:43.433 --> 00:34:47.866
AND A NON-SLOTTED
TEST ARTICLE.

00:34:47.866 --> 00:34:49.466
SO THIS GOES THROUGH AND SHOWS

00:34:49.466 --> 00:34:51.400
TESTING SOME
OF THE TEST ARTICLES

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.333
ON THE TORSION PENDULUM.

00:34:53.333 --> 00:34:54.666
YOU'VE GOT A PICTURE THERE.

00:34:54.666 --> 00:34:58.666
THERE'S A BLOCK DIAGRAM
THAT SHOWS THE TEST ARTICLE.

00:34:58.666 --> 00:35:01.766
WE'VE GOT THE VOLTAGE-CONTROLLED
OSCILLATOR,

00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:04.266
THE VARIABLE-VOLTAGE ATTENUATOR

00:35:04.266 --> 00:35:06.133
GOING INTO THE
DUAL-DIRECTIONAL COUPLER,

00:35:06.133 --> 00:35:08.533
AND WE MEASURE THE FORWARD
AND REFLECTED POWER

00:35:08.533 --> 00:35:10.166
ON THE TORSION PENDULUM,

00:35:10.166 --> 00:35:12.100
AND THEN WE USE A WHIP ANTENNA

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:15.333
THROUGH ONE OF THE GLASS PORTS
IN THE VACUUM CHAMBER

00:35:15.333 --> 00:35:18.766
FOR REAL-TIME TUNING.

00:35:18.766 --> 00:35:20.933
THIS SHOWS A TYPICAL DATA RUN.

00:35:20.933 --> 00:35:22.966
THIS IS THE OPTICAL
DISPLACEMENT SENSOR.

00:35:22.966 --> 00:35:25.566
WE WOULD PUT IN
A CALIBRATION PULSE

00:35:25.566 --> 00:35:26.600
FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME,

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:28.666
TURN OFF THE CALIBRATION PULSE,

00:35:28.666 --> 00:35:33.500
ENERGIZE THE TEST ARTICLE
FOR 30, 60, 90 SECONDS,

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.733
TURN THAT OFF, AND THEN RUN
ANOTHER CALIBRATION PULSE.

00:35:36.733 --> 00:35:40.366
AND THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED
A DATA RUN FOR THE TEST ARTICLE.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:45.600
WE TOOK SOME INFRARED IMAGERY

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.566
OF THE TEST ARTICLE
ON THE TORSION PENDULUM

00:35:47.566 --> 00:35:52.333
TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND WHAT TYPE
OF HEAT THE SYSTEM GENERATED.

00:35:52.333 --> 00:35:54.433
IT'S A HIGH-Q RESONANCE SYSTEM,

00:35:54.433 --> 00:35:56.800
SO THE TEST ARTICLE
IS NOT GOING TO GENERATE

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.833
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF HEAT.

00:35:58.833 --> 00:36:02.133
MOST OF THE HEAT
WAS IN THE HEAT SINK

00:36:02.133 --> 00:36:03.566
FOR THE RF AMPLIFIER,

00:36:03.566 --> 00:36:06.800
AND WE ALWAYS KEPT THE AMPLIFIER
BELOW 100 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.033
WE DIDN'T WANT TO GET IT
TO OVER 100 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

00:36:10.033 --> 00:36:11.400
SO YOU JUST KIND OF SEE
THE BREAKDOWN

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.600
OF THE TEMPERATURE THERE.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:17.333
IT'S ABOUT 85 DEGREES
ON THE AMPLIFIER.

00:36:17.333 --> 00:36:20.000
THIS SHOWS A SYNOPSIS
OF THE TEST RESULTS

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.133
WITH THE CANNAE TEST ARTICLE.

00:36:22.133 --> 00:36:27.266
WE TESTED EACH TEST ARTICLE
IN A FORWARD AND REVERSE SENSE.

00:36:27.266 --> 00:36:29.066
SO YOU SEE
IN THE PICTURES THERE,

00:36:29.066 --> 00:36:31.400
WITH THE THRUST GOING
TO THE LEFT IN THE PICTURE

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.933
AND THE THRUST GOING
TO THE RIGHT.

00:36:32.933 --> 00:36:34.933
BASICALLY, WE FLIPPED
THE TEST ARTICLE.

00:36:34.933 --> 00:36:36.866
ALL THE OTHER
SUPPORTING ELEMENTS

00:36:36.866 --> 00:36:39.733
WERE KEPT
IN THE SAME ORIENTATION.

00:36:39.733 --> 00:36:42.333
THE--ON THE BACK
OF THE TORSION PENDULUM,

00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:46.933
AS I NOTED, THE RF AMPLIFIER
SERVED AS THE COUNTERBALANCE

00:36:46.933 --> 00:36:48.133
FOR THE TEST ARTICLE

00:36:48.133 --> 00:36:50.633
THAT'S ON THE FRONT
OF THE TORSION PENDULUM.

00:36:50.633 --> 00:36:53.933
AND WE ONLY PIPED ACROSS
DC POWER

00:36:53.933 --> 00:36:59.233
AND DIGITAL AND ANALOG DATA
ACROSS THE INTERFACE.

00:36:59.233 --> 00:37:01.233
SO FOR THE SLOTTED
TEST ARTICLE,

00:37:01.233 --> 00:37:03.566
THE AVERAGE STRESS
WAS AROUND 40 MICRONEWTONS

00:37:03.566 --> 00:37:05.266
IN THE FORWARD DIRECTION

00:37:05.266 --> 00:37:08.366
AND ABOUT 49 MICRONEWTONS
IN THE REVERSE DIRECTION.

00:37:08.366 --> 00:37:10.866
THE UN-SLOTTED
ALSO GENERATED THRUST

00:37:10.866 --> 00:37:12.300
IN THE FORWARD
AND REVERSE DIRECTION

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:16.500
AT ABOUT 41
AND 23 MICRONEWTONS.

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.366
WE DID TEST A RF DUMMY LOAD

00:37:18.366 --> 00:37:19.966
WHERE WE WOULD TAKE OFF
THE TEST ARTICLE

00:37:19.966 --> 00:37:22.833
AND PUT THE DUMMY LOAD
ON THE TORSION PENDULUM,

00:37:22.833 --> 00:37:24.533
ENERGIZE THE SYSTEM,

00:37:24.533 --> 00:37:28.900
AND RUN ALL THE RF DRIVE
ELECTRONICS AT FULL POWER,

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.833
AND THAT GENERATED
NO DETECTABLE THRUST

00:37:31.833 --> 00:37:33.866
WITH THIS CONFIGURATION.

00:37:33.866 --> 00:37:38.666
SO THERE WAS NO OTHER
SYSTEMIC DEPENDENCIES

00:37:38.666 --> 00:37:41.500
WITH THE RF EQUIPMENT.

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:44.933
NOW, THE--WE DID SOME WORK
IN COMSOL

00:37:44.933 --> 00:37:46.333
TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND
WHAT WAS HAPPENING

00:37:46.333 --> 00:37:50.466
WITH THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS
IN THE THRUSTER,

00:37:50.466 --> 00:37:54.133
AND WE LOOKED
AT THE RF FEED SYSTEM

00:37:54.133 --> 00:37:55.866
FOR THE TEST ARTICLE.

00:37:55.866 --> 00:38:00.300
THE RF FEED SYSTEMS
HAD A DIELECTRIC SLUG

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.566
INSIDE AS PART
OF THE MATCHING NETWORK,

00:38:02.566 --> 00:38:05.233
A DIELECTRIC SLUG, A PTFE.

00:38:05.233 --> 00:38:07.600
AND WHEN WE LOOKED AT
THE ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:08.700
IN THAT REGION,

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.333
THERE WAS A NET POINTING VECTOR,

00:38:10.333 --> 00:38:12.333
AND SO WE SPECULATED

00:38:12.333 --> 00:38:14.200
THAT THAT MIGHT BE
A QUARTER WAVE,

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.833
A RESONANCE SYSTEM
THAT MIGHT BE EXHIBITING

00:38:15.833 --> 00:38:17.466
SOME Q-THRUSTER PHYSICS.

00:38:17.466 --> 00:38:20.000
SO WE TOOK THE COMSOL
ANALYSIS RESULTS,

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.800
AND WE PLUGGED THEM INTO OUR
ANALYTICAL Q-THRUSTER MODEL,

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.833
AND BASED ON THE AS-TESTED
CONDITIONS FOR 25 WATTS

00:38:27.833 --> 00:38:30.233
WITH A QUALITY FACTOR OF 8,000,

00:38:30.233 --> 00:38:32.833
IT PREDICTED A POTENTIALLY
OBSERVED THRUST

00:38:32.833 --> 00:38:34.600
OF 34 MICRONEWTONS.

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:35.933
THAT'S NOT DEFINITIVE,

00:38:35.933 --> 00:38:38.966
BUT IT'S AT LEAST
WITHIN AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE,

00:38:38.966 --> 00:38:40.233
SO IT WAS INTERESTING TO US,

00:38:40.233 --> 00:38:41.733
AND THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN

00:38:41.733 --> 00:38:44.400
WHY THE SLOTTED
AND THE UN-SLOTTED

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.700
BOTH GENERATED THRUST.

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.633
TO US,
FROM THE Q-THRUSTER PERSPECTIVE,

00:38:47.633 --> 00:38:49.766
THE BIG BELL THERE IS
JUST SIMPLY A MATCHING NETWORK

00:38:49.766 --> 00:38:51.866
TO ESTABLISH
THE RIGHT CONDITIONS

00:38:51.866 --> 00:38:54.166
IN THAT QUARTER WAVE
RESONANCE SYSTEM

00:38:54.166 --> 00:38:57.866
THAT YOU SEE THERE ON THE RIGHT.

00:38:57.866 --> 00:38:59.833
SO WE ALSO LOOKED
AT ANOTHER TOPOLOGY,

00:38:59.833 --> 00:39:02.933
SO WE EXPLORED
A TAPERED THRUSTER APPROACH

00:39:02.933 --> 00:39:04.033
BASED ON SOME WORK DONE

00:39:04.033 --> 00:39:06.166
BY NORTHWEST POLYTECHNICAL
UNIVERSITY.

00:39:06.166 --> 00:39:08.500
SEE YOU IN HOUSTON, PETE.

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:12.466
WE OPTIMIZED THE CONSTRUCTION
AND THE LOCATION

00:39:12.466 --> 00:39:14.533
OF THE DIELECTRIC
AND THE ANTENNAS

00:39:14.533 --> 00:39:16.700
USING COMSOL
AND THE Q-THRUSTER PHYSICS

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:18.600
TO TRY AN UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW,

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:22.233
"CAN WE DEVELOP SOMETHING
THAT WITHIN 25 TO 30 WATTS

00:39:22.233 --> 00:39:25.333
"CAN GENERATE FORCES

00:39:25.333 --> 00:39:29.466
THAT WE CAN CLEARLY SEE
ON THE TORSION PENDULUM?"

00:39:29.466 --> 00:39:31.200
SO IN THE PROCESS
OF DOING THAT,

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.900
WHEN YOU DEAL
WITH A TAPERED SYSTEM,

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:34.066
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT MODES

00:39:34.066 --> 00:39:36.266
THAT YOU CAN EXHIBIT
IN A TAPERED SYSTEM,

00:39:36.266 --> 00:39:39.766
SO WE USED COMSOL
TO GENERATE

00:39:39.766 --> 00:39:43.633
ALL THE PREDICTED
NETWORK PARAMETERS

00:39:43.633 --> 00:39:45.166
WHEN WE USE A VECTOR
NETWORK ANALYZER

00:39:45.166 --> 00:39:48.066
TO GO THROUGH AND TAKE A LOOK
AT THE AS-BUILT SYSTEM

00:39:48.066 --> 00:39:50.533
AND COMPARE IT
TO THE THEORETICAL SYSTEM

00:39:50.533 --> 00:39:52.833
TO MAKE SURE WE'RE EXCITING
THE PARTICULAR MODES

00:39:52.833 --> 00:39:53.933
THAT WE WANT TO EXCITE.

00:39:53.933 --> 00:39:56.233
AND SO YOU SEE A SNAPSHOT
OF THE ANALYSIS

00:39:56.233 --> 00:39:59.566
COMPARED TO THE OUTPUT FROM
THE VECTOR NETWORK ANALYZER.

00:39:59.566 --> 00:40:06.066
THE ONE THING I WILL HIGHLIGHT
IS, THESE TYPES OF SITUATIONS

00:40:06.066 --> 00:40:08.200
ARE A LITTLE PROBLEMATIC
FROM A TUNING PERSPECTIVE.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.466
THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE
POTENTIALLY TWO MODES

00:40:11.466 --> 00:40:13.300
IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY
TO ONE ANOTHER.

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:15.766
AND SO, IF YOU TRY AND COUPLE
TO ONE OF THOSE TWO MODES,

00:40:15.766 --> 00:40:17.666
IT CAN MAKE TUNING
A LITTLE DIFFICULT,

00:40:17.666 --> 00:40:19.633
AND YOU CAN BOUNCE
BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN MODES,

00:40:19.633 --> 00:40:21.766
AND THAT CAN BE
A LITTLE CHALLENGING

00:40:21.766 --> 00:40:25.300
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING
TO GATHER DATA.

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:28.300
THIS SHOWS THE TEST ARTICLE
LOADED ON THE TORSION PENDULUM.

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:32.100
ON THE BOTTOM LEFT THERE,
YOU SEE THE TEST ARTICLE.

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:35.466
THE RF AMPLIFIER
IS ON THE FAR RIGHT.

00:40:35.466 --> 00:40:38.366
IT'S GOT--IT GOES
TO THE DUAL-DIRECTIONAL COUPLER,

00:40:38.366 --> 00:40:39.633
WHERE WE MEASURE
THE POWER FORWARD

00:40:39.633 --> 00:40:41.200
AND POWER REFLECTED.

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.966
IT GOES THROUGH
SOME SHIELDED CABLING

00:40:42.966 --> 00:40:44.800
INTO THE TEST ARTICLE.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:49.466
WE DID GO THROUGH AND MEASURE
ALL OF THE LEAKING RF FIELDS.

00:40:49.466 --> 00:40:52.066
THE SYSTEM WAS VERY RF QUIET.

00:40:52.066 --> 00:40:53.433
ALL THE LEAKING FIELDS WERE LESS

00:40:53.433 --> 00:40:57.300
THAN WHAT A CELL PHONE
WOULD PUT OUT.

00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:00.866
SO WE HAD A VERY CLEAN
RF SYSTEM.

00:41:05.133 --> 00:41:06.433
LET'S GO INTO THE DATA.

00:41:06.433 --> 00:41:09.333
I THINK I'M RUNNING
A LITTLE LOW ON TIME HERE.

00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:14.200
THIS SHOWS US TESTING
AT THE TE012 MODE.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:19.000
USING THE COMSOL ANALYSIS,

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.600
IT PREDICTED FOR--

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:26.466
IT PREDICTED A QUALITY FACTOR
OF 22,000--

00:41:26.466 --> 00:41:31.566
OR 21,800 COMPARED
TO THE 22,000 OBSERVED.

00:41:31.566 --> 00:41:33.800
WE WERE ABLE TO GET
ABOUT 2.6 WATTS OF POWER

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:36.766
INTO THE TEST ARTICLE
IN THIS CONFIGURATION.

00:41:36.766 --> 00:41:41.300
WITH THE COMSOL ANALYSIS
OF THE Q-THRUSTER PHYSICS,

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:46.400
IT PREDICTED A THRUST MAGNITUDE
OF ABOUT 50 MICRONEWTONS.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.066
WE MEASURED
JUST A LITTLE OVER 55.

00:41:49.066 --> 00:41:52.833
YOU SEE A THRUST RUN
UP THERE IN THE INSET

00:41:52.833 --> 00:41:57.100
WITH A CALIBRATION PULSE,
ENERGIZING THE THRUSTER,

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.933
AND THEN ANOTHER
CALIBRATION PULSE.

00:41:58.933 --> 00:42:02.033
THEN YOU SEE THE COMSOL ANALYSIS
OF THE FIELD CONDITIONS

00:42:02.033 --> 00:42:03.133
ON THE TOP RIGHT,

00:42:03.133 --> 00:42:04.133
AND THEN, AGAIN,

00:42:04.133 --> 00:42:05.200
ANOTHER PICTURE
OF THE TEST ARTICLE

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:09.100
ON THE TORSION PENDULUM,
END ON.

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:11.233
THE TE012 MODE HAD--

00:42:11.233 --> 00:42:12.900
IT WAS IN ONE OF THOSE AREAS

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:16.666
WHERE WE HAD ANOTHER MODE
IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY,

00:42:16.666 --> 00:42:18.633
SO THAT MADE OPERATION MODE
DIFFICULT.

00:42:18.633 --> 00:42:21.000
SO WE SWITCHED
TO THE TM211 MODE.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.133
THERE'S ACTUALLY TWO OF THEM

00:42:22.133 --> 00:42:25.300
ABOUT A FEW MEGAHERTZ
FROM ONE ANOTHER.

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:27.866
AND SO WE INVESTIGATED
THE TM211 MODE,

00:42:27.866 --> 00:42:29.866
THE FIRST ONE
AND THE SECOND ONE.

00:42:29.866 --> 00:42:33.133
FOR THE FIRST MODE,

00:42:33.133 --> 00:42:37.033
THE AS-TESTED QUALITY FACTOR
WAS JUST A LITTLE OVER 7,000.

00:42:37.033 --> 00:42:38.866
WE WERE ABLE TO GET
A LITTLE BIT MORE POWER

00:42:38.866 --> 00:42:43.100
INTO THE TEST ARTICLE,
JUST ABOUT 17 WATTS.

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:45.433
THE PEAK THRUST THAT WE OBSERVED
WAS A LITTLE HIGHER,

00:42:45.433 --> 00:42:47.566
116 MICRONEWTONS.

00:42:47.566 --> 00:42:51.133
THE AVERAGE THRUST
WAS ABOUT 91 MICRONEWTONS.

00:42:51.133 --> 00:42:53.466
WHEN WE DID THE NULL FORCE TEST,

00:42:53.466 --> 00:42:58.933
WE MEASURED A 9.6 MICRONEWTON
NULL FORCE.

00:42:58.933 --> 00:43:01.100
THAT'S, AGAIN,
WITH THAT RF LOAD BRICK

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:05.600
THAT WE SHOWED YOU
WITH THE CANNAE TEST ARTICLE.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.233
THE COMSOL ANALYSIS PREDICTED

00:43:07.233 --> 00:43:10.800
A QUALITY FACTOR
OF JUST A LITTLE UNDER 8,000.

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.666
AND WITH AN INPUT POWER
OF 17 WATTS,

00:43:13.666 --> 00:43:17.833
IT PREDICTED AN OBSERVED THRUST
OF 313 MICRONEWTONS.

00:43:17.833 --> 00:43:20.300
SO WE WERE A LITTLE OFF
BY ABOUT A FACTOR OF THREE

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:23.700
WITH THAT PARTICULAR MODE.

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:25.766
AND THIS GOES THROUGH AND SHOWS
SOME OF THE DATA RUNS

00:43:25.766 --> 00:43:27.766
FOR THE TM211 MODE.

00:43:27.766 --> 00:43:29.600
YOU SEE THE CALIBRATION PULSE,

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.566
AND THEN TURNING
THE RF AMPLIFIER ON,

00:43:32.566 --> 00:43:35.133
DOING A LITTLE BIT
OF MANUAL TUNING.

00:43:35.133 --> 00:43:36.433
YOU CAN ALSO SEE,

00:43:36.433 --> 00:43:37.800
WHEN YOU'RE GETTING
INTO THE 100 MICRONEWTONS,

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:40.033
IT'S--IN COMPARISON
TO THE CALIBRATION PULSE,

00:43:40.033 --> 00:43:45.000
IT'S STARTING TO BE
PRETTY LARGE.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.400
THIS SHOWS THE NULL TEST,

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.400
PUTTING THE RF LOAD ON THERE,

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.966
JUST TO GO THROUGH AND SEE
WHAT TYPE OF SYSTEMIC SOURCES

00:43:51.966 --> 00:43:53.833
OR AIR WE MIGHT HAVE,

00:43:53.833 --> 00:43:55.666
AND SO THAT GOES THROUGH
AND SHOWS YOU

00:43:55.666 --> 00:43:59.766
THAT JUST A LITTLE OVER
9 MICRONEWTONS OF FORCE

00:43:59.766 --> 00:44:01.466
IS A RESULT OF THE--

00:44:01.466 --> 00:44:08.400
MAY BE TIED TO THE 5.6 AMPS
THAT WENT TO THE RF AMPLIFIER.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:12.000
WE ALSO TESTED
AT THE SECOND TM211 MODE.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.866
THIS ONE WAS A BETTER RF MODE,

00:44:14.866 --> 00:44:18.166
BUT IT WAS A LESS CAPABLE
Q-THRUSTER MODE

00:44:18.166 --> 00:44:21.433
BASED ON THE ANALYSIS
AND WHAT WE SAW WITH THE DATA.

00:44:21.433 --> 00:44:25.500
SO THE AS-TESTED QUALITY FACTOR
WAS 18,100,

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:30.100
VERSUS THE ABOUT 8,000
FOR THE PREVIOUS TM211 MODE.

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:32.333
ABOUT THE SAME POWER LEVEL.

00:44:32.333 --> 00:44:33.866
THE NET AVERAGE STRESS
WE PICKED UP

00:44:33.866 --> 00:44:39.166
WITH THIS PARTICULAR MODE
WAS JUST ABOUT 50 MICRONEWTONS.

00:44:39.166 --> 00:44:41.233
AND THE COMSOL ANALYSIS
FOR THE TM211

00:44:41.233 --> 00:44:43.500
DOES PREDICT
IT IS A BETTER RF SYSTEM,

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:46.400
AT 32,000 QUALITY FACTOR.

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:50.533
AND WITH AN INPUT POWER OF 16,
JUST A LITTLE UNDER 17 WATTS,

00:44:50.533 --> 00:44:52.933
CORRECTING FOR THE DIFFERENCE
IN THE AS-BUILT QUALITY FACTOR

00:44:52.933 --> 00:44:54.766
VERSUS A THEORETICAL,

00:44:54.766 --> 00:44:57.866
WE'RE PREDICTING A THRUST
OF AROUND 47 MICRONEWTONS.

00:45:01.166 --> 00:45:03.033
SO, WHAT WE FOUND FROM THIS

00:45:03.033 --> 00:45:07.233
IS THAT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE
TWO DIFFERENT SETS

00:45:07.233 --> 00:45:11.300
OF OPTIMIZATION DIALS WE HAVE
TO TRY AND FURTHER EXPLORE.

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:14.466
ONE HAS TO DO
WITH RF OPTIMIZATION,

00:45:14.466 --> 00:45:16.233
AND THE OTHER HAS TO DO
WITH THE Q-THRUSTER PHYSICS.

00:45:16.233 --> 00:45:22.200
AND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY
HAVE THE SAME DEPENDENCIES.

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.400
WE DID FIND
THAT HAVING A DIELECTRIC

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.866
IN THE TAPERED PORTION
OF THE THRUSTER

00:45:26.866 --> 00:45:29.933
WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE THRUST.

00:45:29.933 --> 00:45:31.800
WE SAW THAT BOTH
IN THE ANALYSIS

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:34.100
AND IN THE TEST,

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:37.033
BECAUSE WE DID TEST
THE TE012 MODE

00:45:37.033 --> 00:45:40.466
WITH NO DIELECTRIC PRESENCE
IN THE THRUSTER,

00:45:40.466 --> 00:45:41.933
AND IT DIDN'T GENERATE--

00:45:41.933 --> 00:45:44.966
IT DID NOT GENERATE ANY FORCE
TO WITHIN THE RESOLUTION LEVEL

00:45:44.966 --> 00:45:48.033
OF THE TORSION PENDULUM
UP TO 30 WATTS,

00:45:48.033 --> 00:45:52.833
WHICH ALSO MATCHED
THE PREDICTED PERFORMANCE.

00:45:56.300 --> 00:46:01.933
NOW, THE NPU WORK THAT WAS DONE
HERE IN THE LAST YEAR,

00:46:01.933 --> 00:46:03.400
THEY PUBLISHED SOME RESULTS.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.633
THEY'VE WORKED IN MUCH HIGHER
POWER LEVELS THAN WE HAVE.

00:46:05.633 --> 00:46:08.333
I THINK WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE
TO WORK IN THE LOW POWER.

00:46:08.333 --> 00:46:10.100
OUR TORSION PENDULUM
REALLY HELPS US

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:12.766
KIND OF EXPLORE THE BASICS.

00:46:12.766 --> 00:46:16.700
BUT THEY DID EXPLORE 80 WATTS
UP TO 2 1/2 KILOWATTS,

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:18.333
CONSIDERABLY MORE FORCE,

00:46:18.333 --> 00:46:21.166
UP TO THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS,

00:46:21.166 --> 00:46:23.700
WITH A THRUST TO POWER
THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:25.866
THAN ANYTHING WE'VE WORKED WITH,

00:46:25.866 --> 00:46:27.900
UP TO 1 NEWTON PER KILOWATT.

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:31.833
THEY USED AN INVERTED
PENDULUM THRUST STAND,

00:46:31.833 --> 00:46:33.266
KIND OF A STANDARD
DESIGN APPROACH

00:46:33.266 --> 00:46:35.000
WHERE IT USES NULL DISPLACEMENT.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.666
SO YOU SEE THE--

00:46:38.666 --> 00:46:41.233
THIS IS THE INVERTED PENDULUM
THRUST STAND RIGHT HERE,

00:46:41.233 --> 00:46:43.666
AND IT USES THESE COILS
TO HOLD THE INVERTED PENDULUM

00:46:43.666 --> 00:46:45.033
AT THE ZERO DISPLACEMENT

00:46:45.033 --> 00:46:48.100
BASED ON THE FEEDBACK
FROM THIS SENSOR SYSTEM,

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:49.300
AND THAT'S HOW THEY GO THROUGH

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:51.433
AND MEASURE
AND CHARACTERIZE FORCE.

00:46:51.433 --> 00:46:54.433
IN THIS CASE,
THIS IS THE TEST ARTICLE.

00:46:54.433 --> 00:46:57.366
THE MICROWAVE
WOULD BE DOWN HERE.

00:46:57.366 --> 00:46:59.800
IT WOULD COME IN
THROUGH A CIRCULATOR.

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:03.200
THIS IS A LOAD OVER HERE,

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:07.600
AND THEN IT WOULD GO UP HERE
AND ENERGIZE A SYSTEM.

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.200
AND THIS GOES TO AND SHOWS
THEIR WORK THEY DID

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:14.566
WITH THE 80 TO 1.2 KILOWATTS.

00:47:14.566 --> 00:47:18.133
AND THEY'VE GOT
UP TO 0.9 NEWTONS PER KILOWATT,

00:47:18.133 --> 00:47:21.766
AND THEN THEY ALSO DID WORK
WITH ANOTHER MAGNETRON DESIGN

00:47:21.766 --> 00:47:24.066
THAT WENT UP TO 2 1/2 KILOWATTS.

00:47:24.066 --> 00:47:26.700
AND, AGAIN, THEY SAW
CONSIDERABLY HIGHER FORCES

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:28.333
THAN ANYTHING WE'VE LOOKED AT.

00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:31.700
AGAIN, WE'RE CONTENT TO WORK
AT THE LOW POWER FOR NOW.

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:34.400
IN TERMS
OF THE VALUE PROPOSITION

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:38.233
WITH SOME OF THE EXPERIENCE
WE'VE SEEN WITH THESE THINGS,

00:47:38.233 --> 00:47:39.366
A LOT OF PEOPLE
ALWAYS WANT TO KNOW,

00:47:39.366 --> 00:47:40.566
"THIS IS INTERESTING AND FINE,

00:47:40.566 --> 00:47:42.000
"BUT WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.400
IF YOU TRY AND APPLY IT
TO AN APPLICATION?"

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.966
AND SO, IF YOU'VE GOT A SYSTEM
THAT'S CAPABLE

00:47:47.966 --> 00:47:50.933
OF GENERATING 0.4 NEWTONS
PER KILOWATT,

00:47:50.933 --> 00:47:54.266
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT GONNA
LIFT ITSELF OFF THE GROUND,

00:47:54.266 --> 00:47:58.100
BUT IT IS POTENTIALLY A USEFUL
IN-SPACE PROPULSION SYSTEM.

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:00.500
AND SO WE LOOKED AT WHAT HAPPENS

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:03.233
IF YOU HAVE 0.4 NEWTONS
PER KILOWATT

00:48:03.233 --> 00:48:04.666
WITH SOME TYPE OF A STACK

00:48:04.666 --> 00:48:07.333
THAT'S IN A DISTANT RETROGRADE
ORBIT AROUND THE MOON.

00:48:07.333 --> 00:48:10.600
SO THIS IS KIND OF LINKING BACK
TO THE ASTEROID MISSION.

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.066
AND SO YOU'VE GOT
SOME STACKED MASS

00:48:12.066 --> 00:48:16.100
THAT'S ABOUT THE RIGHT MASS
FOR SOME TYPE OF AGGREGATE

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:21.233
OF MODULES THAT WE MIGHT USE
IN HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT.

00:48:21.233 --> 00:48:23.733
BUT WE'RE CONSTRAINED
WITH ONLY 300 KILOWATTS

00:48:23.733 --> 00:48:25.100
OF SOLAR POWER.

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:27.833
SO, IN TERMS OF THE THINGS
THAT WE HAVE ON THE HORIZON,

00:48:27.833 --> 00:48:31.400
THAT'S ONE OF THE CONSTRAINTS
THAT WE HAVE TO REALLY SALUTE.

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:34.166
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE GIVEN
VERY BIG ARRAYS

00:48:34.166 --> 00:48:37.200
THAT HAVE HUGE VALUES
ASSOCIATED WITH THEM.

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:40.266
300 KILOWATTS IS
A VERY REALISTIC CONSTRAINT

00:48:40.266 --> 00:48:42.000
THAT WE NEED
TO TRY AND WORK WITH

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.833
AND TRY TO DO THE MOST WE CAN
WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT.

00:48:44.833 --> 00:48:47.133
SO, IN THIS CASE,
WITH A 70-TON STACK

00:48:47.133 --> 00:48:49.600
DEPARTING FROM
A DISTANT RETROGRADE ORBIT

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:52.266
WITH 300 KILOWATTS
OF SOLAR POWER,

00:48:52.266 --> 00:48:56.866
WE CAN GO TO A 50-DAY MISSION
AROUND DEIMOS

00:48:56.866 --> 00:49:01.000
AND GET BACK TO EARTH
IN 788 DAYS.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.600
THE OTHER THING WE DID WAS,
WE CONSTRAINED IT

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:06.666
SO THAT YOU WOULD NOT GO
IN VENUS' ORBIT.

00:49:06.666 --> 00:49:10.300
AND SO, IN ORDER TO KIND OF
MATCH THE PLANETARY BILLIARDS,

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:13.533
THE SPACECRAFT SWINGS OUT
TO 2 A.U.

00:49:13.533 --> 00:49:15.466
TO TRY AND WAIT FOR EARTH

00:49:15.466 --> 00:49:18.766
TO GET INTO
A MORE FAVORABLE ALIGNMENT,

00:49:18.766 --> 00:49:20.533
KIND OF LIKE
A HIGH YO-YO MANEUVER,

00:49:20.533 --> 00:49:24.100
FOR THE PILOTS
THE THAT ARE IN THE GROUP.

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.566
NOW, IF WE EVER DID
HAVE SOME TYPE

00:49:25.566 --> 00:49:28.600
OF A CONSISTENT POWER SOURCE

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:32.700
THAT WERE UP TO
A COUPLE OF MEGAWATTS--

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:34.400
I LOOKED AT,

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:37.166
"WHAT COULD YOU DO
WITH 0.4 NEWTONS PER KILOWATT

00:49:37.166 --> 00:49:40.533
WITH 2 MEGAWATTS OF POWER
FOR A 90-TON SPACECRAFT?"

00:49:40.533 --> 00:49:42.866
OUT OF THAT,
50 TONS WOULD BE CARGO.

00:49:42.866 --> 00:49:45.966
20 TONS WOULD BE ALLOCATED
TO THE NUCLEAR REACTOR,

00:49:45.966 --> 00:49:48.500
SO THAT'S ABOUT 10 KILOGRAMS
PER KILOWATT.

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:49.733
FOR FOLKS THAT ARE FAMILIAR

00:49:49.733 --> 00:49:51.833
WITH REACTORS WE'VE LOOKED AT
IN THE PAST,

00:49:51.833 --> 00:49:53.400
WE'RE NOT TRYING
TO BE OVERLY AGGRESSIVE

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:55.366
IN TERMS OF WHAT
THE REACTOR WOULD HAVE TO BE

00:49:55.366 --> 00:49:57.600
IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC MASS.

00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.766
AND THEN 10 KILOGRAMS
PER KILOWATT FOR THE Q-THRUSTER.

00:49:59.766 --> 00:50:01.233
SO THAT'S ABOUT TWICE
WHAT YOU'D DO

00:50:01.233 --> 00:50:02.666
FOR A HALL THRUSTER,

00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:05.833
SO WE TRIED TO BE
JUST A LITTLE SLOPPY WITH THAT.

00:50:05.833 --> 00:50:07.800
YOU GET A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT
LOOK AND FEEL

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.333
THAN WHAT WE SAW
IN THE PREVIOUS SLIDE.

00:50:09.333 --> 00:50:10.500
THE PREVIOUS SLIDE LOOKS MORE

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:13.266
LIKE A TRADITIONAL
LOW-THRUST MISSION.

00:50:13.266 --> 00:50:16.333
BUT WHAT HAPPENS HERE
IS THAT THE THRUST-TO-MASS

00:50:16.333 --> 00:50:17.766
FOR THE SPACECRAFT

00:50:17.766 --> 00:50:21.600
ACTUALLY BREAKS 0.6 MILLI-Gs.

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:25.533
SO WHEN YOU'RE IN HELIOCENTRIC
SPACE AT 1 A.U.,

00:50:25.533 --> 00:50:28.633
0.6 MILLI-Gs IS THE ATTRACTION
TO THE SUN,

00:50:28.633 --> 00:50:32.000
SO WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE
ANY SPACECRAFT OF ANY KIND

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.166
WITH POWER
AND ELECTRIC PROPULSION,

00:50:34.166 --> 00:50:37.300
IF IT CAN EXCEED
THAT 0.6 MILLI-Gs,

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:39.466
THEN YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO
INTERESTING THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:50:39.466 --> 00:50:40.866
SO, INDEPENDENT
OF THE Q-THRUSTERS,

00:50:40.866 --> 00:50:42.100
THAT'S JUST
AN INTERESTING METRIC

00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:44.600
THAT WE FOUND IN THE PROCESS
OF EXPLORING THAT.

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:47.200
I THINK I'M RUNNING
REALLY LOW ON TIME,

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:50.000
SO LET ME JUST POP THROUGH
TO THE PLAN FORWARD.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.666
SO, MOVING FORWARD,
WE WANT TO IMPLEMENT

00:50:52.666 --> 00:50:55.933
A PHASE LOCK LOOP
THAT PREVENTS US--

00:50:55.933 --> 00:50:58.933
THAT PRECLUDES US
FROM HAVING TO DO MANUAL TUNING.

00:50:58.933 --> 00:51:02.900
WE CAN BASICALLY HAVE ALMOST
LIGHT SWITCH-LIKE RELIABILITY.

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:05.166
WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO GATHER
A CONSIDERABLE MORE--

00:51:05.166 --> 00:51:09.166
A LARGER AMOUNT OF DATA OVER
MULTIPLE OPERATING CONDITIONS.

00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:10.933
WE WANT TO DO
SOME POWER SCANNING.

00:51:10.933 --> 00:51:14.533
WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE
SOME DIFFERENT RF MODES

00:51:14.533 --> 00:51:18.033
AND EXPLORE SOME DIFFERENT
ANTENNA CONFIGURATIONS.

00:51:18.033 --> 00:51:19.633
AND THEN THE TEST SYSTEM
THAT WE HAVE NOW,

00:51:19.633 --> 00:51:22.133
THE AMPLIFIER THAT WE PROCURED

00:51:22.133 --> 00:51:23.866
HAS THE ABILITY TO BE TESTED
AT VACUUM,

00:51:23.866 --> 00:51:26.800
AND SO THAT'S OUR NEXT STEP.

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:32.066
THEN, INSTEAD OF DOING
A TEST WITH AN RF DUMMY LOAD,

00:51:32.066 --> 00:51:33.633
WE WANT TO PERFORM
FUTURE NULL TESTS

00:51:33.633 --> 00:51:37.266
WITH THE THRUSTER
ACTUALLY ROTATED ORTHOGONAL

00:51:37.266 --> 00:51:38.533
TO THE THRUST EXIT.

00:51:38.533 --> 00:51:41.133
SO WE WANT TO LEAVE THE THRUSTER
ON THE TORSION PENDULUM,

00:51:41.133 --> 00:51:43.100
TEST IN ONE DIRECTION,
THE OTHER DIRECTION,

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.200
AND THEN ROTATE IT
WHERE IT'S ORTHOGONAL

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.100
TO THE THRUST VECTOR.

00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:49.233
AND THEN, ONCE WE'VE POUNDED
ALL THAT FLAT, UH,

00:51:49.233 --> 00:51:51.133
WE'VE BEEN TALKING
WITH GLENN RESEARCH CENTER

00:51:51.133 --> 00:51:54.200
ABOUT DOING SOME INDEPENDENT
VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:55.500
IN THEIR VACUUM CHAMBER.

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:57.500
THEY HAVE A LOW-THRUST
TORSION PENDULUM

00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:01.033
THAT WE CAN UTILIZE
TO GO THROUGH AND EXPLORE

00:52:01.033 --> 00:52:03.166
WHAT IT DOES IN THAT FACILITY.

00:52:03.166 --> 00:52:04.633
AND JOHNS HOPKINS
HAS ALSO TALKED

00:52:04.633 --> 00:52:07.366
ABOUT DOING SOME TYPE
OF CAVENDISH BALANCE TEST

00:52:07.366 --> 00:52:09.400
WITH THE IV&amp;V SHIPSET.

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.666
SO I THINK WITH THAT,

00:52:11.666 --> 00:52:13.766
I'M JUST ABOUT ALMOST
UP TO MY TIME.

00:52:13.766 --> 00:52:15.833
SO I'LL HAND IT OVER
TO QUESTIONS.

00:52:15.833 --> 00:52:18.833
[applause]

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:26.733
- OKAY, QUESTIONS, EVERYBODY.

00:52:26.733 --> 00:52:28.133
- THANK YOU FOR COMING HERE.

00:52:28.133 --> 00:52:29.566
- YES, SIR.

00:52:29.566 --> 00:52:31.766
- I HAVE A HYPOTHETICAL FOR YOU.

00:52:31.766 --> 00:52:34.133
IF YOU HAD AN UNLIMITED BUDGET

00:52:34.133 --> 00:52:38.000
AND A MISSION TO GET YOURSELF
TO ALPHA CENTAURI

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.233
AND HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN
AN ALCUBIERRE TYPE WARP DRIVE

00:52:42.233 --> 00:52:45.066
AND AN ANTIMATTER DRIVE--

00:52:45.066 --> 00:52:47.066
IT WOULD BE, OF COURSE,
SUBLUMINAL--

00:52:47.066 --> 00:52:51.233
WHICH WOULD YOU THINK WOULD BE
THE MORE PRACTICAL CHOICE?

00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:55.700
- THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:57.933
I WOULD--I'M GONNA ANSWER
YOUR QUESTION.

00:52:57.933 --> 00:52:59.233
I'M NOT GONNA PICK A HORSE.

00:52:59.233 --> 00:53:01.800
I WOULD PROBABLY DO BOTH,
FROM THE STANDPOINT--

00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:05.166
IF I HAD THE UNLIMITED BUDGET
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,

00:53:05.166 --> 00:53:07.333
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE
MULTIPLE PATHS

00:53:07.333 --> 00:53:09.200
TO MAYBE GREATER--

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.133
OR EXCUSE ME--INCREASE
THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS.

00:53:11.133 --> 00:53:13.166
- OKAY, LET ME FRAME IT;
YOU ONLY GET TO PICK ONE.

00:53:13.166 --> 00:53:16.000
- I ONLY GET--OH, I ONLY
GET TO PICK ONE.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.200
I DON'T KNOW THAT I'M
PREPARED TO ANSWER THAT.

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:19.633
IF YOU HAVE AN UNLIMITED BUDGET

00:53:19.633 --> 00:53:20.866
AND YOU WANT TO COME BACK
AND TELL ME,

00:53:20.866 --> 00:53:24.266
THEN I'LL MAKE A DECISION,
RIGHT?

00:53:24.266 --> 00:53:25.333
YES.

00:53:25.333 --> 00:53:27.200
I GUESS--OH, YEAH.

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.633
- THANK YOU.

00:53:28.633 --> 00:53:30.200
MAYBE I MISSED IT.

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.266
WHAT EXACTLY PHYSICAL PHENOMENON

00:53:32.266 --> 00:53:34.766
ARE YOU MEASURING
IN THESE FEW INTERFEROMETERS,

00:53:34.766 --> 00:53:39.266
AND WHAT RESULTS WOULD YOU
CONSIDER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE?

00:53:39.266 --> 00:53:42.133
SO COULD YOU EXPLAIN THIS
A LITTLE BIT?

00:53:42.133 --> 00:53:44.266
- YOU'RE ASKING, WHAT ARE WE
TRYING TO MEASURE--

00:53:44.266 --> 00:53:46.533
- THESE INTERFEROMETERS...

00:53:46.533 --> 00:53:47.700
- YEAH, AN INTERFEROMETER.

00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:48.933
- YEAH.

00:53:48.933 --> 00:53:50.666
- WE'RE TRYING TO CHANGE
THE OPTICAL PATH LENGTH

00:53:50.666 --> 00:53:53.733
IN A VERY SMALL REGION
OF THE INTERFEROMETER

00:53:53.733 --> 00:53:55.900
BY HAVING
THE APPROPRIATE CONDITIONS

00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:58.233
WITH WHAT THE GENERAL
RELATIVITY REQUIRES,

00:53:58.233 --> 00:54:00.100
AND THEN IT SAYS,
IN A LOCAL REGION,

00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:01.666
IT'LL CHANGE
THE PERCEIVED PATH LENGTH

00:54:01.666 --> 00:54:04.866
FOR THE PHOTON LINE INTEGRALS.

00:54:04.866 --> 00:54:06.666
SO THEN THAT'LL MANIFEST ITSELF

00:54:06.666 --> 00:54:09.166
IN THE FORM OF A SLIGHT CHANGE
OF THE INTERFERENCE PATTERN.

00:54:09.166 --> 00:54:10.800
I MEAN, NOT SOMETHING YOU'RE
GONNA SEE WITH THE NAKED EYE.

00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.933
IT REQUIRES COMPUTERS TO SEE.

00:54:12.933 --> 00:54:15.600
- THANK YOU.

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:16.600
- YEAH, SORRY.

00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:18.000
- SINCE I GOT THE MIC...

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000
- HE'S GOT IT.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.433
- COULD I--

00:54:20.433 --> 00:54:22.500
REGARDING THE Q-THRUSTER,

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:24.833
COULD I GET YOU TO ADDRESS

00:54:24.833 --> 00:54:27.400
THIS WHOLE CONSERVATION
OF MOMENTUM QUESTION?

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:28.733
- ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.

00:54:28.733 --> 00:54:31.600
SO THE Q-THRUSTER
DOES CONSERVE MOMENTUM

00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:35.566
IF IT WORKS AS WE THINK IT DOES,
BASED ON THE PHYSICS.

00:54:35.566 --> 00:54:37.166
IF YOU'RE PUSHING
OFF THE QUANTUM VACUUM,

00:54:37.166 --> 00:54:39.000
YOU'RE ESTABLISHING
AN ANISOTROPIC STATE

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.400
IN THE QUANTUM VACUUM,

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.500
AND SO IT IS PUTTING A WAKE
OUT OF THE BACK OF THE THRUSTER.

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:44.900
AND AT SOME POINT,

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:47.933
IF WE CONTINUE TO SEE GOOD DATA

00:54:47.933 --> 00:54:50.233
AND WE RULE OUT
ALL OTHER FALSE POSITIVES,

00:54:50.233 --> 00:54:52.266
ONE OF THE THINGS WE WOULD
LIKE TO GO THROUGH AND EXPLORE

00:54:52.266 --> 00:54:54.700
IS, WHAT IS
THE MOMENTUM DISTRIBUTION

00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:57.266
AND WHAT'S THE DIVERGENCE ANGLE
OF THE WAKE?

00:54:57.266 --> 00:54:59.733
AND SO WE WOULD DO THAT
BY USING ANOTHER Q-THRUSTER

00:54:59.733 --> 00:55:00.966
THAT WOULD KIND OF RECOUPLE

00:55:00.966 --> 00:55:02.833
WITH THE WAKE
IN THE QUANTUM VACUUM

00:55:02.833 --> 00:55:05.033
AND TRY AND MEASURE THE WAKE.

00:55:07.633 --> 00:55:08.633
- OKAY.

00:55:08.633 --> 00:55:09.833
OH, WAIT.

00:55:09.833 --> 00:55:13.433
COULD YOU DO CAUSALITY
ON THE OTHER ONE TOO?

00:55:13.433 --> 00:55:14.600
- CAUSALITY.

00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:17.566
- ON THE WARP DRIVE, HOW--

00:55:17.566 --> 00:55:20.466
DO YOU AVOID CAUSALITY
VIOLATION, OR DOES IT HAPPEN?

00:55:20.466 --> 00:55:22.433
- YEAH, YOU NEVER LOCALLY
EXCEED THE SPEED OF LIGHT,

00:55:22.433 --> 00:55:23.733
SO YOU CAN'T DO ANY--

00:55:23.733 --> 00:55:25.566
I LIKE "DOCTOR WHO"
AS MUCH AS THE NEXT GUY,

00:55:25.566 --> 00:55:27.566
BUT YOU CAN'T--
THERE'S NO TIME TRAVEL POSSIBLE

00:55:27.566 --> 00:55:30.066
WITH THE SPACEWARP.

00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:34.800
YEAH.

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:36.266
- THANKS.

00:55:36.266 --> 00:55:41.200
THE ALCUBIERRE WARP METRIC
AND OTHER ONES

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:43.400
REQUIRE EXOTIC MATTER.

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:44.400
- MM-HMM.

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:45.400
- HOW--

00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:46.800
AND SO, I PRESUME,

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:49.833
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE
SOME KIND OF ALCUBIERRE THING

00:55:49.833 --> 00:55:53.200
ON THE OPTICAL BENCH
WITH THIS INTERFEROMETER,

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:58.566
ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE EXOTIC
MATTER IN YOUR "TEST ARTICLE"?

00:55:58.566 --> 00:56:00.300
WHICH YOU DIDN'T SAY
VERY MUCH ABOUT.

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:02.033
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THAT TEST ARTICLE,

00:56:02.033 --> 00:56:05.633
AND WHY SHOULD IT BE
AN ALCUBIERRE-LIKE EFFECT?

00:56:05.633 --> 00:56:07.500
- YEAH, SO THE LOW-FIDELITY
TEST ARTICLE IS TRYING

00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:11.400
TO CREATE A BLUE-SHIFTED FRAME
RELATIVE TO THE LAB.

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:13.333
SO WE'RE JUST USING
A LARGE POTENTIAL ENERGY

00:56:13.333 --> 00:56:15.166
WITH OUR LOW-FIDELITY
TEST ARTICLES.

00:56:15.166 --> 00:56:16.566
THE HIGHER-FIDELITY TEST ARTICLE

00:56:16.566 --> 00:56:17.833
THAT I SHOWED YOU GUYS
A PICTURE OF,

00:56:17.833 --> 00:56:20.033
THAT IS BASED
ON THE Q-THRUSTER PHYSICS,

00:56:20.033 --> 00:56:21.633
AND SO THAT'S
WHERE WE GO THROUGH

00:56:21.633 --> 00:56:24.066
AND WE WORK ON USING
THE NEGATIVE VACUUM ENERGY

00:56:24.066 --> 00:56:26.833
TO TRY AND SATISFY
ALL THE EXPLICIT REQUIREMENTS

00:56:26.833 --> 00:56:28.566
OF THE FIELD EQUATIONS.

00:56:28.566 --> 00:56:31.033
SO THAT TEST ARTICLE IS TRYING
TO ESTABLISH MORE ACCURATELY

00:56:31.033 --> 00:56:33.566
THE REQUIREMENTS AS SET UP
BY THE MATHEMATICS,

00:56:33.566 --> 00:56:34.833
WORKING WITH
NEGATIVE VACUUM ENERGY,

00:56:34.833 --> 00:56:35.833
CASIMIR FORCE.

00:56:35.833 --> 00:56:36.833
- BUT WAIT--

00:56:36.833 --> 00:56:37.866
OH, AM I OFF?

00:56:37.866 --> 00:56:39.900
OKAY, BUT--

00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:42.100
MAYBE WE COULD TAKE THIS OFFLINE
IF IT'S TOO TECHNICAL.

00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:46.300
BUT E-FIELDS, B-FIELDS,
THE KIND OF THINGS YOU GET

00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:53.266
INSIDE OF A RESONANT CAVITY
OR WITH CAPACITORS AND COILS,

00:56:53.266 --> 00:56:55.566
NONE OF THOSE ARE EXOTIC MATTER.

00:56:55.566 --> 00:56:58.333
THOSE ARE ALL JUST
STANDARD MASS ENERGY,

00:56:58.333 --> 00:57:01.000
NOT THE KIND THAT YOU NEED
FOR THE ALCUBIERRE METRIC,

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.633
WHICH HAS THE OPPOSITE SIGN,

00:57:02.633 --> 00:57:03.866
WHICH NO ONE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE.

00:57:03.866 --> 00:57:05.166
- LET ME ANSWER YOUR QUESTION.

00:57:05.166 --> 00:57:06.800
AND WE HAD SOME OF THIS
DISCUSSION ACTUALLY YESTERDAY

00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:08.100
IN YOUR OFFICE.

00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:11.100
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
SOME OF THE Q-THRUSTER PHYSICS.

00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:13.466
SO, IN TERMS
OF THE Q-THRUSTER PHYSICS,

00:57:13.466 --> 00:57:15.266
WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING
AT CLASSICAL E&amp;M.

00:57:15.266 --> 00:57:17.133
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
WHAT THAT POTENTIALLY DOES

00:57:17.133 --> 00:57:20.000
IN THE QUANTUM VACUUM
BASED ON THE PHYSICS MODELS

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000
ASSOCIATED WITH
THE Q-THRUSTER PHYSICS.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.233
SO WITH THE Q-THRUSTER PHYSICS,

00:57:23.233 --> 00:57:24.800
IT POTENTIALLY PROVIDES
A CONNECTION

00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:27.600
TO A PERTURBED STATE
IN THE QUANTUM VACUUM.

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:29.566
SO, YES,
JUST THE PURE E&amp;M FIELDS,

00:57:29.566 --> 00:57:31.700
BY THE CLASSICAL SENSE,
THEY'RE REALLY NOT OF INTEREST.

00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:33.366
WHAT'S OF INTEREST TO US IS,
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN

00:57:33.366 --> 00:57:35.833
WHEN WE LOOK AT IT FROM THE
Q-THRUSTER PHYSICS PERSPECTIVE?

00:57:35.833 --> 00:57:39.900
SO THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
WHY THERE'S INTEREST IN THAT.

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:41.933
- OKAY, SO LET ME SEE
IF I UNDERSTAND THIS.

00:57:41.933 --> 00:57:45.266
IF YOU JUST HAD
THE E&amp;B FIELDS,

00:57:45.266 --> 00:57:48.766
YOU WOULD EXPECT
NO EXOTIC EFFECT,

00:57:48.766 --> 00:57:52.366
BUT IF YOU HAVE
THESE DIELECTRICS, OR WHATEVER,

00:57:52.366 --> 00:57:56.000
INSIDE OF IT SO THAT YOU'RE
GETTING THIS STRONG COUPLING,

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.500
THEN MAYBE YOU WOULD SEE
AN EXOTIC EFFECT?

00:57:58.500 --> 00:57:59.800
- YOU MADE TOO STRONG
OF A STATEMENT.

00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:01.300
I THINK THAT THERE'S--

00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:03.733
IN THE PROCESS OF EXPLORING
WHAT Q-THRUSTER PHYSICS MEANS

00:58:03.733 --> 00:58:06.266
FOR THE MAGNITUDE
OF E&amp;B FIELDS

00:58:06.266 --> 00:58:07.666
AND HOW THAT MIGHT BE COUPLED

00:58:07.666 --> 00:58:11.400
TO WHAT'S POTENTIALLY GOING ON
IN THE QUANTUM VACUUM,

00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:13.133
IN PRINCIPLE, RIGHT,

00:58:13.133 --> 00:58:15.400
YOU HAVE TO HAVE
THE RIGHT CONDITIONS

00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:20.133
TO GET THE MAGNITUDE OF
AN EFFECT THAT YOU CAN MEASURE.

00:58:20.133 --> 00:58:22.233
BUT YOU WERE TOO GENERAL
WITH YOUR STATEMENT,

00:58:22.233 --> 00:58:24.866
SO I CAN'T AGREE WITH YOU
COMPLETELY WITH THAT.

00:58:24.866 --> 00:58:25.866
ANYWAY...

00:58:25.866 --> 00:58:26.866
- OKAY, THANK YOU.

00:58:26.866 --> 00:58:28.100
- WE HAVE ONE MORE
QUESTION HERE.

00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:29.100
- OKAY.

00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:30.900
- THIS IS VERY--
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:32.266
THIS IS VERY NON-TECHNICAL,

00:58:32.266 --> 00:58:35.300
MORE OF A POPULAR SCIENCE
MAGAZINE TYPE QUESTION FOR YOU,

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:37.666
SO BE AMBIGUOUS IF YOU WANT TO.

00:58:37.666 --> 00:58:41.233
BUT, ASSUMING THAT
ALL YOUR MEASUREMENTS

00:58:41.233 --> 00:58:43.933
ARE NOT DOMINATED
BY SYSTEMATIC NOISES

00:58:43.933 --> 00:58:45.500
THAT YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE REALIZED
AT THIS POINT,

00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:48.033
ASSUMING THAT ALL THOSE
MEASUREMENTS ARE CORRECT,

00:58:48.033 --> 00:58:49.166
AND--SORRY?

00:58:49.166 --> 00:58:50.566
- I DIDN'T HEAR THAT LAST PART.

00:58:50.566 --> 00:58:52.200
- OH, ASSUMING THAT ALL THOSE
MEASUREMENTS ARE CORRECT,

00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:53.533
THAT THEY'RE NOT DOMINATED
BY NOISE

00:58:53.533 --> 00:58:55.066
THAT YOU HAVEN'T ACCOUNTED FOR.

00:58:55.066 --> 00:58:58.600
AND IN A FICTIONAL WORLD
WHERE YOU WILL HAVE FUNDING

00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:03.166
TO CONTINUE PURSUING THIS
AT A COMFORTABLE LEVEL

00:59:03.166 --> 00:59:04.800
FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS,

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:06.500
WHERE DO YOU ENVISION
THIS TECHNOLOGY TO BE

00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:07.833
IN 20 YEARS TIME?

00:59:07.833 --> 00:59:09.033
IS THIS SOMETHING
THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO USE

00:59:09.033 --> 00:59:11.933
TO SEND SATELLITES
TO OTHER PLANETS?

00:59:11.933 --> 00:59:13.300
- YOU KNOW,
THAT'S A BIG QUESTION.

00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:15.500
I DON'T HAVE A GOOD ANSWER
FOR YOU.

00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:17.900
I MEAN, CERTAINLY YOU'D LIKE
TO MAKE A LOT OF PROGRESS,

00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:20.300
BUT, I MEAN,
THERE'S NO SHORTCUTS, RIGHT?

00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:22.766
YOU KNOW, IT'S DEFINITELY
CRAWL, WALK, RUN.

00:59:22.766 --> 00:59:24.833
WE'LL TRY AND MAKE
AS MUCH PROGRESS AS WE CAN

00:59:24.833 --> 00:59:27.500
WITHIN THE RESOURCES
THAT WE HAVE.

00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:29.866
AND, BASICALLY, THE DATA'S
REALLY GOING TO DRIVE

00:59:29.866 --> 00:59:31.466
THAT DISCUSSION, RIGHT?

00:59:31.466 --> 00:59:32.966
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
IN GOD WE TRUST;

00:59:32.966 --> 00:59:34.466
EVERYBODY ELSE, BRING DATA.

00:59:34.466 --> 00:59:36.433
SO DATA'S REALLY GOING TO DRIVE
THAT DISCUSSION.

00:59:36.433 --> 00:59:37.733
SO I'M SORRY IT'S NOT LIKE--

00:59:37.733 --> 00:59:39.333
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T GIVE YOU
A GOOD QUIP ANSWER,

00:59:39.333 --> 00:59:40.466
BUT, YEAH, JUST--

00:59:40.466 --> 00:59:42.133
THERE'S NO SHORTCUTS,
RIGHT, SO...

00:59:42.133 --> 00:59:43.166
- I TOLD YOU,
YOU COULD BE AMBIGUOUS.

00:59:43.166 --> 00:59:44.166
THAT'S FINE.

00:59:44.166 --> 00:59:45.366
- YEAH.

00:59:45.366 --> 00:59:47.733
- OKAY, PLEASE JOIN ME
IN THANKING DR. WHITE.

00:59:47.733 --> 00:59:50.733
[applause]

00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:59.600
[musical tones]
[electronic sounds of data]
