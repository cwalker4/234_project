SHANE SMITH: After getting
kicked out of the logging

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.440
camp, we headed into
the forest in

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.880
search of actual loggers.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.470
The Fish knew all the lumber
hot spots, and, after some

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.930
very lurchy driving, he
found us a working

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.640
cadre deep in the forest.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.940
This guy is really going
to want to talk to us.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.920
Maybe I should soften it up a
bit with the shotgun before we

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.540
get out, so they know
we mean business.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.790
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Good idea.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.330
SHANE SMITH: After our heated
words at the logging camp, we

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.800
decided to try to irrigate
the conversation with the

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.520
universal tongue-loosener--

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.864
booze.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.930

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.800
SHANE SMITH: So what he's
saying here is that the

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.090
majority of workers have a
10-year-plus labor commitment

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.110
to live and work out in
the middle of nowhere

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.460
for almost no pay.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.800

off, he seemed confused.
