00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.497
They just told me back there

00:00:12.047 --> 00:00:16.371
apparently, there's a golden rule
in book publishing

00:00:16.941 --> 00:00:22.552
that says, "with every formula you show,
you lose half of your audience."

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.599
I have two on my first slide.

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:30.904
But I only want to show you these formulas
to illustrate that with just a few symbols

00:00:30.904 --> 00:00:33.364
like "F" equals "m" times "a,"

00:00:33.364 --> 00:00:38.794
we can describe a wealth of phenomena
- from the Earth around the Sun,

00:00:38.794 --> 00:00:41.675
from a ball game,
from your bike ride, everything.

00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:46.881
Or if you are a communications person,
you may like Maxwell's equation.

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:51.392
Everything we do with our radio,
or mobile phone communication,

00:00:51.392 --> 00:00:53.994
or actually, the fact
that we see each other

00:00:54.414 --> 00:00:58.544
is all described by this very simple
Maxwell equation that you see here.

00:00:58.544 --> 00:00:59.568
It's so simple.

00:00:59.568 --> 00:01:02.527
It describes basically
these two equations,

00:01:02.527 --> 00:01:05.307
describes basically
everything in our daily life.

00:01:06.987 --> 00:01:08.384
But there's more.

00:01:08.384 --> 00:01:11.953
Besides our classical world,
there's also a quantum mechanical world;

00:01:11.953 --> 00:01:16.393
this is the world of atoms,
molecules, the very small particles.

00:01:16.393 --> 00:01:19.430
And again, we have
a very simple-looking equation.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.605
It has a Greek symbol in it
and that makes it a little bit obscure,

00:01:23.605 --> 00:01:26.045
but otherwise, it's fairly short.

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:29.856
And please be impressed
that this equation,

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:33.727
the SchrÃ¶dinger equation,
describes all of chemistry.

00:01:34.278 --> 00:01:38.391
So in some sense, because our bodies
are big chemical factories

00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:41.991
with all the atoms held together
by quantum mechanical glue,

00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:47.461
our existence is thanks
to quantum mechanics.

00:01:48.726 --> 00:01:52.766
But maybe with this third equation,
and losing another half of the audience,

00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:53.872
that many people think,

00:01:53.872 --> 00:01:57.032
'Well, these small particles,
they're not my thing,'

00:01:57.812 --> 00:02:01.622
or 'Formulas, I never
have understood them.

00:02:02.092 --> 00:02:03.792
I'm more of the human scale.

00:02:03.792 --> 00:02:08.388
I want to feel things, or hear things,
or maybe even touch things.'

00:02:09.628 --> 00:02:12.586
In that case, you are the right person
for me to talk to

00:02:12.586 --> 00:02:16.643
because I will not show
any more formulas in my presentation.

00:02:16.643 --> 00:02:19.388
I will actually show you
some quantum objects

00:02:19.388 --> 00:02:21.240
that you can actually see,

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.052
you can actually hear them,
and you can touch them.

00:02:25.375 --> 00:02:26.692
So let's start.

00:02:27.812 --> 00:02:30.408
It all starts, actually,
up to a few minutes ago,

00:02:30.408 --> 00:02:31.809
before I came on stage,

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:35.303
that quantum mechanics
was describing very well, very accurately

00:02:35.303 --> 00:02:37.459
the world of atoms and molecules.

00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:42.460
Then, at larger scale,
and it had already started at our unit,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.543
the biological cell, it kind of stops.

00:02:46.223 --> 00:02:48.678
The biologist takes the cell

00:02:48.678 --> 00:02:52.573
as the fundamental unit
to build up biology.

00:02:53.093 --> 00:02:54.997
This is an enormous simplification 

00:02:54.997 --> 00:02:57.531
because it completely
ignores quantum mechanics.

00:02:57.921 --> 00:03:01.385
But it is as best as we can do
at this moment.

00:03:01.803 --> 00:03:03.623
Larger objects like our hair,

00:03:03.623 --> 00:03:07.053
which is basically the smallest thing
we can see with our eyes;

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:10.066
or us, you know, that's all classical.

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.288
But the small things can
be described very accurately.

00:03:14.288 --> 00:03:16.499
And the people who
put forward this theory -

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:18.319
the quantum theory -

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:26.465
maybe they've made the greatest
intellectual revolution of mankind.

00:03:27.141 --> 00:03:30.232
You see a picture here
with on the first row,

00:03:30.232 --> 00:03:33.132
very prominent - Albert Einstein.

00:03:34.262 --> 00:03:36.443
You can clearly recognize him
in the middle.

00:03:36.443 --> 00:03:40.403
On his right, left for us,
there is Hendrik Lorentz, our Dutch hero.

00:03:40.403 --> 00:03:43.320
And next to Lorentz, we see Madame Curie.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.668
And many of these men in this picture

00:03:46.668 --> 00:03:49.365
have received a Nobel Prize
for their great work.

00:03:50.276 --> 00:03:53.367
There's one person
who got the Nobel Prize twice.

00:03:54.187 --> 00:03:57.468
That's actually the only woman
in the picture, Madame Curie.

00:03:57.698 --> 00:03:59.596
So apparently, it's true what they say

00:03:59.596 --> 00:04:04.403
that women have to perform twice as good
in order to be part of the gang.

00:04:04.403 --> 00:04:05.666
(Laughter)

00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:06.940
She did it.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.354
(Applause)

00:04:11.254 --> 00:04:13.879
This is a hundred years ago. What's new?

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.167
Well, present day geniuses look like this.

00:04:17.537 --> 00:04:22.621
This is a group of brilliant people
that form our group at the TU Delft.

00:04:22.621 --> 00:04:26.602
But again, they are at the verge
of a new quantum era.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.009
We are no longer studying atoms
and molecules as given by nature,

00:04:33.025 --> 00:04:36.992
in contrast to that
we actually design and make,

00:04:36.992 --> 00:04:39.549
by using very advanced
fabrication techniques,

00:04:39.549 --> 00:04:41.743
new objects, much bigger,

00:04:41.743 --> 00:04:47.087
but that still showed us
this absurd quantum mechanical behavior.

00:04:47.817 --> 00:04:50.244
So what is actually absurd
about quantum mechanics?

00:04:50.244 --> 00:04:53.191
Why are we so excited
about our quantum stuff?

00:04:53.551 --> 00:04:57.168
Let me give you two examples
of absurd quantum mechanics.

00:04:57.848 --> 00:05:00.469
The first example
is quantum superposition.

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:03.491
Let's take a particle,
like an electron or something,

00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:05.808
and bring it into a ring structure.

00:05:06.318 --> 00:05:10.163
And the particle can take
the upper arm to get to the exit

00:05:10.163 --> 00:05:12.816
or take the lower arm to get to the exit.

00:05:13.774 --> 00:05:15.982
Now, what actually happens
in quantum mechanics

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:20.262
is that the electron takes both arms
at the same time, simultaneously -

00:05:20.262 --> 00:05:24.690
really sitting in the upper arm
as well as in the lower arm

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.476
at the very same time.

00:05:27.196 --> 00:05:29.414
And we know this
because we follow the particle

00:05:29.414 --> 00:05:33.531
and we see that at the exit of the ring
it actually collides with itself -

00:05:33.531 --> 00:05:35.406
it bounces into itself.

00:05:35.756 --> 00:05:38.236
And we observe this as interference.

00:05:39.066 --> 00:05:41.923
And such a superposition
of being at two different locations

00:05:41.923 --> 00:05:43.210
at the same time

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.107
has been very thoroughly checked
in all kinds of experiments.

00:05:47.643 --> 00:05:49.278
Quantum superposition.

00:05:50.146 --> 00:05:53.311
The next example
is the example of entanglement.

00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:55.539
And we start very simple.

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.214
We take, let's say, a red particle
and a white particle.

00:05:59.602 --> 00:06:01.548
Very classical colors.

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:05.273
Then the next step
is that we bring them together

00:06:05.273 --> 00:06:07.319
and we make them interact a little bit.

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:10.423
So we bring them been very close together
so they feel each other.

00:06:10.793 --> 00:06:14.244
And by virtue of this interaction,
they become entangled;

00:06:14.244 --> 00:06:16.531
they take over each other's properties.

00:06:16.531 --> 00:06:20.775
So in terms of color,
they become white-reddish.

00:06:21.732 --> 00:06:23.341
Now that's OK.

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:28.911
The curious thing happens if we take them,
we entangle them, and bring them apart.

00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:32.697
And while taking them apart,
they remain entangled.

00:06:32.697 --> 00:06:35.179
They still - the one
that's on the left for you,

00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:37.430
still has some properties
of the other particle,

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.259
which can be at a very large distance,

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:43.245
as far as the size
of the universe, in principle.

00:06:44.551 --> 00:06:47.457
So that's entanglement
over a very long distance -

00:06:47.457 --> 00:06:50.657
particles keep having
each other's properties.

00:06:50.657 --> 00:06:51.686
So what can we do?

00:06:51.686 --> 00:06:54.086
How can we actually measure that?

00:06:54.616 --> 00:06:56.620
Well, the problem is
that if we measure it,

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.214
we have a classical, let's say,
color measurement apparatus,

00:07:00.214 --> 00:07:02.829
and the color measurement
apparatus is a classical thing

00:07:02.829 --> 00:07:04.664
so it can only give classical answers.

00:07:04.664 --> 00:07:07.352
So it says, let's say, red or white.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.929
So if I say, 'Well, particle on the left,
what is actually your color?'

00:07:11.929 --> 00:07:14.791
and I measure it,
it says, for instance, 'red.'

00:07:15.668 --> 00:07:18.986
But maybe you notice
that the particle on the right,

00:07:18.986 --> 00:07:21.845
at the same moment, became white.

00:07:21.845 --> 00:07:23.662
Now let's check it again.

00:07:24.022 --> 00:07:26.211
I measure the left particle,

00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:29.420
and the one on the right
immediately becomes white.

00:07:30.359 --> 00:07:34.308
And that's because color
is a conserved quantity in the universe.

00:07:34.308 --> 00:07:36.738
So if something completely turns red,

00:07:36.738 --> 00:07:39.462
there's something else
where it used to be entangled with,

00:07:39.462 --> 00:07:41.562
it's completely turning white.

00:07:41.562 --> 00:07:44.878
And this action, over a large distance,

00:07:44.878 --> 00:07:47.479
now remember, it can be
the size of the universe,

00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:52.194
these particles can be apart,
takes place instantaneously.

00:07:52.194 --> 00:07:53.652
Let me put it there.

00:07:53.652 --> 00:07:56.082
A measurement of the color
on the left particle

00:07:56.083 --> 00:07:59.517
immediately changes also
the color that's far away.

00:07:59.517 --> 00:08:01.723
And so if I do something here,

00:08:01.723 --> 00:08:04.031
and at the same time
I change something there,

00:08:04.031 --> 00:08:09.085
without any signals traveling over,
to actually say, 'well, just go there,'

00:08:09.378 --> 00:08:10.944
there's nothing in between.

00:08:10.944 --> 00:08:13.205
Much faster than the speed of light.

00:08:14.476 --> 00:08:16.624
So this is a prediction
from quantum theory.

00:08:16.624 --> 00:08:20.138
And one guy - Einstein - said:

00:08:20.138 --> 00:08:21.798
(Laughter)

00:08:21.798 --> 00:08:22.981
'That must be wrong.

00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:26.141
Any theory that predicts
spooky action on a distance -

00:08:26.141 --> 00:08:28.152
do something here,
change something there -

00:08:28.152 --> 00:08:31.965
that's a prediction
that tells that the theory is wrong' -

00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:35.404
it doesn't say it's possible,
tells us the theory is wrong.

00:08:35.404 --> 00:08:37.718
Luckily, we also have
other heroes in physics,

00:08:37.718 --> 00:08:41.911
and this is a theoretical physicist
called Richard Feynman.

00:08:41.911 --> 00:08:43.888
And he said, 'Let's not be bothered

00:08:43.888 --> 00:08:48.319
with all this philosophical, you know,
consequences of our theory,

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:50.801
let's calculate and see what happens.'

00:08:51.751 --> 00:08:53.974
Now here at the Delft
University of Technology,

00:08:53.974 --> 00:08:57.925
we educate engineers,
actually guys like me,

00:08:57.925 --> 00:09:02.033
and our approach
is that if you feel challenged,

00:09:02.353 --> 00:09:04.694
we say, 'OK, let's do it.'

00:09:05.134 --> 00:09:06.394
So what do we do?

00:09:07.384 --> 00:09:10.013
We take these two particles,
we bring them far apart,

00:09:10.013 --> 00:09:11.862
and we make it a bit more complicated,

00:09:11.862 --> 00:09:14.791
we bring in a third particle,
the green one.

00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:18.872
The green one we bring it to the left one,
and we make these two interact.

00:09:18.872 --> 00:09:21.066
I'm going to give them some interaction

00:09:21.066 --> 00:09:23.646
but view the graph carefully.

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:25.891
You see that at the same moment,

00:09:25.891 --> 00:09:28.410
when these two interact
and share some color,

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:29.930
also the particle on the right,

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.150
which was still entangled
with the first one,

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.330
also becomes green a little bit.

00:09:35.298 --> 00:09:37.497
The next is that I ask for color.

00:09:37.497 --> 00:09:39.354
'Hey, left particles.'

00:09:39.354 --> 00:09:43.610
I do a color measurement, and they,
for instance, turn white-reddish.

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:47.027
At the same time,
the one on the right becomes green.

00:09:47.027 --> 00:09:49.163
So look what I've done, effectively.

00:09:49.163 --> 00:09:50.229
Let's start again.

00:09:50.229 --> 00:09:53.239
I bring in a green particle,
they entangle.

00:09:53.239 --> 00:09:55.539
They're also entangled
with the one on the right.

00:09:55.539 --> 00:09:57.091
I click once more,

00:09:57.091 --> 00:09:59.087
and the one on the right is now green.

00:09:59.897 --> 00:10:02.832
I have teleported the green particle

00:10:02.832 --> 00:10:05.497
from the left universe
to the right universe

00:10:05.497 --> 00:10:08.123
over a long distance, instantaneously.

00:10:09.013 --> 00:10:10.873
So this teleportation is what we call,

00:10:10.873 --> 00:10:15.663
let's say, absurd,
or strange, or very odd.

00:10:15.663 --> 00:10:18.783
But we can do it, and we actually do it.

00:10:18.783 --> 00:10:20.843
And actually, we do this in the lab.

00:10:20.843 --> 00:10:22.745
And we've actually done it so many times

00:10:22.745 --> 00:10:26.007
that we actually made
a student-proof setup.

00:10:26.007 --> 00:10:28.675
I can tell you,
if a setup is student proof,

00:10:28.675 --> 00:10:31.415
then it's a very robust setup.

00:10:31.415 --> 00:10:32.581
(Laughter)

00:10:32.581 --> 00:10:34.978
Alright, so what do we make?

00:10:34.978 --> 00:10:37.914
We want to make some stuff
that we can actually use

00:10:37.914 --> 00:10:39.508
and do something with.

00:10:39.508 --> 00:10:43.336
First of all, a very simple
example of a light bulb.

00:10:43.336 --> 00:10:46.186
It's a plain wire; if we send
a current through the wire,

00:10:46.186 --> 00:10:47.781
or it's excited by light,

00:10:47.781 --> 00:10:50.996
it also luminesces
a little bit of its light.

00:10:50.996 --> 00:10:52.962
But in this case, the wire is very small;

00:10:52.962 --> 00:10:56.410
it's only nanometers in diameter,
maybe a micrometer long.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.859
At the red arrow that you see,

00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:01.909
we excite the system
with some laser light,

00:11:01.909 --> 00:11:04.270
and we actually look
what comes out of the wire.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.379
And if we do that, you actually see

00:11:06.379 --> 00:11:10.616
a little bit of light
coming out of the thing, right?

00:11:10.616 --> 00:11:12.096
That bright spot.

00:11:13.116 --> 00:11:15.143
Now what is special about this bright spot

00:11:15.143 --> 00:11:18.580
is that if you analyze it
with a good detector,

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:24.299
it actually comes out as a stream
of individual light particles, one by one.

00:11:24.299 --> 00:11:27.706
It's no longer a stream of light,
it's really granular -

00:11:27.706 --> 00:11:31.142
one comes out,
the next one comes out, etc.

00:11:31.142 --> 00:11:36.318
And these are our photons that we use
in these color experiments to teleport.

00:11:37.167 --> 00:11:40.428
Let me give you another example,
a different type of -

00:11:40.428 --> 00:11:45.279
If you are more of a hearing person,
then let me take a string.

00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:49.525
And with all our strings,
guitar, or violin, or whatever,

00:11:49.525 --> 00:11:51.562
if you put a little tension on the string,

00:11:51.562 --> 00:11:55.751
the tone of the music
goes up in frequency.

00:11:55.751 --> 00:11:57.136
The tone goes up.

00:11:57.136 --> 00:11:59.281
So we've taken a very thin wire,

00:11:59.281 --> 00:12:01.901
a nanotube, only one
nanometer in diameter,

00:12:01.901 --> 00:12:04.691
we suspend it over a trench,

00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:09.001
we clamp it very tightly at two contacts,

00:12:09.001 --> 00:12:11.797
and we excite the nanotube
with an electric pulse.

00:12:11.797 --> 00:12:15.418
It starts to vibrate,
and we hear the tone.

00:12:16.081 --> 00:12:19.257
Now, what is special
about this particular vibration

00:12:19.257 --> 00:12:22.694
is that it is very small,
so it's also very sensitive.

00:12:22.694 --> 00:12:26.969
So if we add one electron,
one quantization of electrical charge,

00:12:26.969 --> 00:12:28.539
to this nanotube,

00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:31.318
it's a little bit of extra tension
into the nanotube

00:12:31.318 --> 00:12:34.013
that changes the tone a little bit.

00:12:34.013 --> 00:12:35.915
Let me hear you
the sounds of electrons.

00:12:35.915 --> 00:12:38.977
(Tone variably dropping in pitch)

00:12:40.171 --> 00:12:41.391
(Tone stops)

00:12:43.079 --> 00:12:45.367
The composition could
be a bit more interesting,

00:12:45.367 --> 00:12:46.702
but the change in tone, 

00:12:46.702 --> 00:12:48.727
if you go from one level
to the next level,

00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:53.894
that change is induced
by one particular individual electron.

00:12:54.391 --> 00:12:55.845
You hear ...

00:12:58.155 --> 00:12:59.629
Let us hear it again.

00:12:59.629 --> 00:13:02.645
What you hear are
individual quantum electrons.

00:13:02.645 --> 00:13:05.049
(Tone variably dropping in pitch)

00:13:07.609 --> 00:13:09.358
Now it's coming to our ears.

00:13:09.358 --> 00:13:11.328
And it becomes audible.

00:13:12.248 --> 00:13:14.271
Now let me give you
the most recent example

00:13:14.271 --> 00:13:16.511
that comes straight
from the lab of my colleague

00:13:16.511 --> 00:13:18.065
Leonardo DiCarlo.

00:13:18.345 --> 00:13:21.277
And actually, I need
to do something for this.

00:13:23.137 --> 00:13:25.409
The DiCarlo lab actually made a box.

00:13:25.409 --> 00:13:28.466
You see the box already
on the picture, on the upper right,

00:13:28.466 --> 00:13:31.302
with a few coaxial connectors to it.

00:13:32.394 --> 00:13:37.702
And if I get my gloves on,
it will actually let me touch the box.

00:13:41.577 --> 00:13:42.667
Alright.

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:47.140
And the box is big.

00:13:47.738 --> 00:13:49.539
I can hold it in my hands.

00:13:55.816 --> 00:14:00.505
What we do in our group
is to make small electronic elements -

00:14:01.265 --> 00:14:04.359
elements that are so small
that they can process information

00:14:04.359 --> 00:14:06.058
in a completely different way.

00:14:06.058 --> 00:14:09.144
Instead of having bits of zeros and ones,

00:14:09.144 --> 00:14:11.513
we want to make superpositions of bits,

00:14:11.513 --> 00:14:15.704
a superposition of being zero and one
at the very same time.

00:14:15.704 --> 00:14:18.100
But you want to make them
on an electronic circuit.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:22.393
And what Leo DiCarlo has done
is make three qubits -

00:14:22.393 --> 00:14:25.658
and I'm going to zoom in
a little bit in a few seconds,

00:14:25.658 --> 00:14:28.430
but you already see the box
with three qubits in it -

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:32.782
and these three qubits can
be put in a superposition,

00:14:32.782 --> 00:14:37.528
or be entangled together
in any arbitrary way that we wish.

00:14:37.918 --> 00:14:42.710
Let me see if the camera
can actually show you the qubits.

00:14:45.845 --> 00:14:47.305
There must be more zoom.

00:14:48.275 --> 00:14:51.534
This is my finger.
So this is the size of the system.

00:14:52.326 --> 00:14:53.478
I hope you can see

00:14:53.478 --> 00:14:57.898
that there are three black spots
on this quartz plate.

00:14:57.898 --> 00:14:59.719
And these three black spots

00:14:59.719 --> 00:15:02.399
are about a centimeter
away from each other.

00:15:02.869 --> 00:15:07.101
And these are our qubits
which are in quantum superposition,

00:15:07.101 --> 00:15:10.669
and we can entangle
different qubits together.

00:15:11.239 --> 00:15:15.199
So we're now on a chip of centimeter size,

00:15:16.746 --> 00:15:19.867
the distance between the different qubits
is about a centimeter,

00:15:19.867 --> 00:15:23.877
and we can perform all this
quantum absurdness on this chip

00:15:23.877 --> 00:15:26.157
at a visible length scale.

00:15:27.464 --> 00:15:30.219
Alright, so you've seen it.

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:32.990
Now, of course, it only works

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:37.714
if the details are fabricated
very precisely,

00:15:37.714 --> 00:15:39.659
and the details are nanometer scale.

00:15:39.659 --> 00:15:42.100
So it's not just
that every centimeter object

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.906
starts to behave quantum mechanically,

00:15:43.906 --> 00:15:47.268
no, you really have
to engineer it very precisely,

00:15:47.268 --> 00:15:48.710
down to the nanometer scale.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.862
That's a picture that you see right here.

00:15:51.732 --> 00:15:54.703
OK. Let me zoom out a little bit.

00:15:55.115 --> 00:15:57.783
What are we trying to do here?

00:15:58.856 --> 00:16:02.417
We actually want to make
quantum mechanical systems,

00:16:02.417 --> 00:16:05.062
and use the richness of quantum systems,

00:16:05.062 --> 00:16:08.110
like the extra possibilities
of being superpositions

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:12.237
and their having very fast teleportation
over long distances,

00:16:12.237 --> 00:16:13.539
also in technology.

00:16:13.539 --> 00:16:15.234
Can we make applications

00:16:15.234 --> 00:16:19.474
that are much more efficient
than we have today?

00:16:21.294 --> 00:16:22.791
Particularly,

00:16:22.791 --> 00:16:25.661
because we're in the quantum
information business,

00:16:25.661 --> 00:16:31.473
we want to extend the level of quantum
from the atom to a transistor,

00:16:31.473 --> 00:16:34.364
that is already the case,
that's working very well.

00:16:34.364 --> 00:16:38.277
But we want to bring even up
to a higher level of complexity,

00:16:38.277 --> 00:16:42.541
at a complete electronic circuit
that behaves quantum mechanically.

00:16:42.541 --> 00:16:46.772
And it would win so much in efficiency,
you would not believe it.

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:49.806
And that would also make
our gadgets a lot faster.

00:16:51.156 --> 00:16:55.852
Now, only a few years ago,
people also in our field were saying

00:16:55.852 --> 00:16:58.129
that that's not going to happen,

00:16:58.129 --> 00:17:01.163
that's inherently impossible
as quantum mechanics

00:17:01.163 --> 00:17:05.880
to bring them up to a larger scale
of size and complexity.

00:17:06.717 --> 00:17:09.366
But with the progress
of the last few years,

00:17:09.366 --> 00:17:10.859
I can really say here,

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:13.941
actually, I'm saying it
for the first time in public,

00:17:13.941 --> 00:17:16.971
it is clear that it will come.

00:17:17.411 --> 00:17:20.102
Yes, we will be able
to make quantum circuits,

00:17:20.102 --> 00:17:25.146
and a quantum computer
will only take maybe a decade later or so.

00:17:25.816 --> 00:17:29.434
Alright, let me conclude here
with a take-home message.

00:17:30.208 --> 00:17:35.768
I started with some equations,
including one for quantum mechanics,

00:17:35.768 --> 00:17:39.148
but there's one message
that up to a couple of minutes ago,

00:17:39.148 --> 00:17:42.192
quantum was only restricted
to the small objects,

00:17:42.192 --> 00:17:46.588
but from now on, it has
arrived to the human scale,

00:17:46.588 --> 00:17:50.605
and we can see it, we can hear it
and we can touch it.

00:17:50.955 --> 00:17:53.483
Thank you very much, and have a great day.

00:17:53.483 --> 00:17:55.390
(Applause)
