00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.900
- Will, uh, heard that there
was somebody in the audience

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.100
he wanted to meet, right?

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.400
- Yes, there's someone here
I want to meet.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.400
Her name is, uh,
Shani Glasby.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.400
- Shani--
[laughter]

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.233
She was in
"The Price Is Right."

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:14.566
All right.

00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:17.166
- Hi!

00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:18.733
[cheers and applause]

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:19.933
- How are you?
- How you doing?

00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.166
[inaudible chatter]

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.866
- Hi, Ellen.
- Hi.

00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.000
- Hi, Ellen.
- How are you?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.266
- Here, have a seat, Shani.
Have a seat.

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.400
- All right, [laughter].
- Hi.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.366
- Hi.
- Do I have--do I have a mic?

00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.666
- You have a mic, here.

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:32.733
Oh, you have to switch chairs.
- Okay.

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.333
- All right, we'll switch.
Okay.

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.566
- There's a mic in that chair.
- There's a mic in that chair.

00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:36.800
Okay.
- So we'll--

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.033
we'll attach her to that mic.
- Sit there.

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:39.733
Wait, but, no, then maybe
you should sit--

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:40.900
- Okay, and then I'll sit here.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.666
- And next to me,
maybe you should go--

00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.066
maybe you should--
okay.

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.166
- What happened
to the mic?

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.800
All right, well.
- You got--

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.000
- All right.
- Wait, hold on.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.566
- We're out of time.
[laughter]

00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.600
Be kind to one another.
Bye.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.600
[laughter]

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.166
- All right, here we go.
- Okay, you got it?

00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.566
Yeah, this'll work.
- There we go.

00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.966
- All right, surprise.
This is a planned surprise.

00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.500
- That went well, Ellen.
- All right, right.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.333
You're gonna go here now.
- Okay, we'll go back.

00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.333
All right.
- I'll go here.

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:06.833
- You got that, yes.
- All right.

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:09.800
- All right.
Whoo.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.633
- Oh, my gosh.

00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:13.433
We figured that out.
- Geez.

00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:14.900
- Oh, man.
- I'm exhausted.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.866
- Me too.
That's the most I've worked

00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:18.566
in a long time.

00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:22.200
- You are so high maintenance.
- Oh, see, I can't help it.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.500
- Hi, Shani.
- Hi.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.800
- Hi.
Tell, uh, tell everybody

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.066
why you wanted to meet Shani.

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:30.600
- Well, so, Shani is--
is a third grade teacher,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.633
and, uh, you know,
I've been checking you out.

00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:34.533
I got--I got my folks
checking on you.

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:36.600
- Oh, okay.
- And, uh, Shani, the--

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.733
their--her children
didn't have afterschool programs

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:44.266
at the school,
so she put it together herself.

00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:46.066
And she--how many--
how many kids is it

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:48.500
in the program?
- It has 28 kids right now.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.033
- 28 kids.
- So it's a step--

00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:51.600
explain what step is.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.966
- A step team
is basically a group of people

00:01:53.966 --> 00:01:56.300
who get together
and they use their entire body

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.533
as an instrument.
- Mm-hmm.

00:01:57.533 --> 00:02:00.700
And the make sounds and rhythms
with hand clapping

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.200
foot stomping, you know.
- Ooh.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.400
Things like that.
- Ooh, stop playing.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.633
Stop playing, girl.
Stop playing.

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:07.966
[laughter]

00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:09.333
- All right.
- You know, so I saw--

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:13.133
I saw this story and, uh,
so Ellen and I talked about it.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.833
So we--we want to be a part
of helping you out.

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:15.966
- Oh, my gosh.

00:02:15.966 --> 00:02:17.400
- Why did you start this
in the first place?

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.500
- Well I started it because
the kids in our school--

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.266
we have a Title I school,
and so the children

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:23.833
just go home and go to school
and that's all they do.

00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:25.966
And so I wanted to do something
where they felt like

00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:27.200
they belong.
- Right.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.233
- And I really wanted
the kids to learn how

00:02:28.233 --> 00:02:29.500
to believe in themselves.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.933
So I just started something
where the kids

00:02:31.933 --> 00:02:34.100
can just work hard,
get good grades,

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.600
you know,
have good behavior.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.000
And just something
that makes them feel

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.433
like they're
a part of something.

00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:39.866
- What's amazing, Shani,
is that, you know,

00:02:39.866 --> 00:02:41.600
and even though
you don't need instruments

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.066
you're using your hands
and your body as instruments

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:47.133
it still costs like $70
for a pair of shoes

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:48.533
to do this, right?
- Yes.

00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:51.633
And like a lot of teachers
you were using your own money

00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:53.566
and spending your own money
to help these kids

00:02:53.566 --> 00:02:55.300
so that they have shoes, right?
- Absolutely, yup.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.366
- You have to do
what you have to do.

00:02:56.366 --> 00:02:58.433
- All right, well--

00:03:00.233 --> 00:03:01.900
so you don't know this.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.633
We surprised you
calling you down here.

00:03:03.633 --> 00:03:06.266
We also surprised you because
your kids are here.

00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:07.700
So we're gonna watch them.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.700
[laughter]

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.666
[cheers and applause]

00:03:11.666 --> 00:03:15.500
[cheering]

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.733
- Come on.

00:03:16.733 --> 00:03:17.733
- Oh!

00:03:17.733 --> 00:03:19.633
Oh!

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:21.800
- For Ellen!

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.800
[clapping in rhythm]

00:03:27.733 --> 00:03:30.733
[clapping and stomping
in rhythm]

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.600
- Ellen.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.100
all: Be generous.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.500
Be kind

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.966
to one another.

00:03:48.966 --> 00:03:51.966
[cheers and applause]

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.166
- Oh, my God.

00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:58.166
[cheers and applause]

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.733
- Shani, uh,
our friends at Shutterfly

00:04:02.733 --> 00:04:04.433
think you're a game changer
as well

00:04:04.433 --> 00:04:07.300
and they want to give you
a check for $10,000.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.300
[cheers and applause]
