00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.190
Explain

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.230
Fossils capture our imagination, giving us
a glimpse into the past.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:36.609
While many of the 
more

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:50.609
mysterious fossils have been explained by
now, a few remain a total enigma, with theories

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:56.089
ranging from giants to missing link humans.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.089
Hi!

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:02.679
I am Mister Mysterious and I welcome you to
Mysterious5.

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:08.159
In this video, we’ll take a look at some
of the most mysterious fossil discoveries

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.860
science can’t explain.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.970
Enjoy!

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.730
FIVE: Homo Naledi

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:27.460
Homo Naledi is an extinct species related
to humans, whose fossil skeletons were found

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.070
in the Rising Star Cave system, in 2013, near
Johannesburg.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:43.570
This discovery caused massive excitement among
anthropologists, who flocked to this location

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.700
to start looking for additional fossils.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.730
They unveiled more than 1,500 human fossils
representing some 15 individuals, both male

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.890
and female, young and old.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:09.860
Today, this is one of the richest assemblages
of human fossils ever found.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:28.260
The team was able to deduce the bones belonged
to a new species, which had a curious mix

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:36.470
of primitive traits, such as a tiny brain,
and modern features, including long legs.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:43.450
They determined that these individuals were
capable climbers and long-distance walkers.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:51.080
Still, the scientists were unable to determine
when exactly this species lived.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.170
The creature’s primitive characteristics
suggested it was very old.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.610
But its modern traits, along with the condition
of the bones, which seemed to be barely fossilized,

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.980
hinted that Homo Naledi lived more recently.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:14.550
Some of the newest reports are saying that
these human fossils are between 230,000 and

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.959
330,000 years old.

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.540
This raises intriguing questions about the
origins and evolution of our own species.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.410
This isn’t only shaking up the family tree
of human evolution, but also questions our

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:39.120
ideas about the behavior and cognitive abilities
of primitive human species.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.830
FOUR: Tully Monster

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:50.630
Discovered in 1955 by collector Francis Tully,
the first Tully Monster fossil completely

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.090
defied explanation.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.960
Paleontologists eagerly wanted to place the
fossil within well-known classifications,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.050
but nobody could figure out what the monster
was actually related to.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.470
Francis Tully took the fossil to the Field
Museum in Chicago, seeking some answers.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.530
Other collectors quickly found one specimen
after another, and very soon, hundreds ended

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.000
up at the Field Museum.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.570
Even though we still don't know much about
this creature, scientists believe that the

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.320
Tully Monster is a close relative of modern
lampreys.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.960
This is a nightmarish, blood-sucking fish
that looks like a toothed suction cup.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:44.440
But although the Tully Monster is a lamprey
in its heart, it looks nothing like one from

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.660
the inside.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.560
Its body is short and stout.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.980
Its eyes sit at the end of a rigid bar.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:00.160
Some of the newest findings are saying that
this creature had gills and a notochord, which

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.080
functioned as a rudimentary spinal cord.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.900
Some key questions about this strange creature
remain unanswered.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.620
No one knows when this animal first appeared
on Earth or when it went extinct.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:21.630
The true nature of the Tully monster is a
mystery.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.940
THREE: Ancient Giant Armadillo

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:36.480
While out on a Christmas day stroll along
a stream to the south of Buenos Aires, Argentina,

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.360
Jose Antonio Nievas spotted something peculiar
sticking out of a riverbank.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:52.850
The object was greenish and pebbly, and at
first, Nievas thought he had discovered an

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.360
enormous dinosaur egg.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.590
He was wrong.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:05.160
With a little more excavation, the unusual
find turned out to be something much more

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:13.270
recent: a nearly complete shell of a beast
that trundled around South America over 10,000

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.040
years ago.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.330
Exactly what species of mammal Nievas discovered
is yet to be determined.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:34.400
Some of the early reports by paleontologists
say that this might be a glyptodont.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.520
It turns out that there’s nothing quite
like a glyptodont alive today.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:48.169
While they are similar to armadillos in having
a very strong armor made of bone, the glyptodonts

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:51.080
have a different kind of shell.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:58.610
Many glyptodonts had caps of bone over their
skulls to help protect them from jaguars,

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.530
saber-toothed cats, and other predators.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.680
Ultimately, though, all the glyptodonts died
out.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:13.860
The very last of their kind disappeared by
about 10,000 years ago, with climate change

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.510
and ecological disturbance.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:22.169
In case this mysterious-looking fossil turns
out to be a glyptodont, this discovery will

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:28.570
be of great value to biologists and paleontologists.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.479
TWO: Indonesian Hobbit

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:40.759
In 2016, buried 6 feet beneath a volcanic
rock on the Indonesian island of Flores, scientists

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:48.330
have found the fossilized remains of a petite
hominin that lived 700,000 years ago.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:54.840
The discovery consisted of just six tiny teeth
and a fragment of a small lower jawbone.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:01.759
However, this was enough to give the scientists
a clue that these mysterious-looking bones

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:07.500
could belong to a direct ancestor of the strange
and diminutive human relative called Homo

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:12.450
Floresiensis, also known as the “Hobbit”.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:26.569
The world was first introduced to this species
in 2004 when an international team of researchers

00:08:26.569 --> 00:08:33.069
announced the discovery of a never-before-seen
hominin that had been found in the Liang Bua

00:08:33.069 --> 00:08:35.039
cave of Flores.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:43.410
These ancient human relatives lived between
50,000 and 100,000 years ago.

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:49.960
They stood just 3,5 feet tall, which is the
height of an average 4-year-old modern-day

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.960
child.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:57.490
Their brains were roughly one-third the size
of our own, or about the size of a chimpanzee’s

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:58.490
brain.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:04.670
What is interesting here is that the newest
discovery might be another proof that the

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:14.180
Hobbit is actually Homo Erectus, who is directly
related to modern-day humans.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:20.450
It is believed that Homo Erectus may have
arrived at this island from Java after being

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.910
washed out to sea by a tsunami.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:29.920
Over time, this species began to shrink on
its new island home – which actually is

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.339
a common phenomenon known as island dwarfism.

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:44.380
As scientists believe, lots of animals that
end up on islands get smaller

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:53.839
for a variety of reasons like limited food
sources, or because there are no large predators

00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:54.970
to stay big for.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:58.510
Either way, we are still far from learning
what happened to this species.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:05.830
The Hobbit might prove that human diversity
could be far greater than we ever realized.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:11.269
ONE: The Nevada Giants

00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:16.420
Many Native American tribes tell stories about
the long-forgotten existence of humans that

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:21.180
were much taller and stronger than ordinary
men.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:28.250
These giants are described as both brave and
barbaric, and legends often mention their

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.640
cruelty.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:37.500
The Paiute, a tribe that settled in the Nevada
region thousands of years ago, refer to these

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.880
red-haired giants as Si-Te-Cah.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:48.200
As odd as it may sound, this legend repeats
itself all over the Americas, suggesting that

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:54.750
it might be an incomplete chronicle of a real
event that happened a long time ago.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:11:00.640
Settlers to the West did not originally believe
the Native Americans, dismissing the legends

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.300
as pointless stories.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:15.769
That changed in 1911 when miners discovered
Lovelock Cave.

00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:22.100
The cave was huge, and the miners could see
that it was previously inhabited.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:34.950
When they started digging, they discovered
hundreds of well-preserved ancient artifacts.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:59.940
For example, a pair of 15-inch-long sandals
was an intriguing find.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:06.420
Furthermore, a number of huge bones were discovered
that had to come from people nearly ten feet

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.709
tall.

00:12:07.709 --> 00:12:16.880
Digging also revealed fossilized handprints
that were much bigger than any human handprint.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:40.120
Another dig that happened in 1931 revealed
a set of equally-disturbing finds.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:46.470
According to an article published in the Nevada
Review-Miner, two giant skeletons had been

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:50.440
found buried in a dry lake bed close to Lovelock.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:57.649
The over-sized remains that measured 10 feet
in height were mummified in a manner similar

00:12:57.649 --> 00:13:00.350
to the one employed by ancient Egyptians.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:07.260
Another common trait between these mummified
giants remains is the presence of red hair.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:12.480
Today, we don’t know what happened to these
mummified remains.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:24.490
However, several artifacts can be viewed in
Winnemucca, Nevada at the Humboldt Museum.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:33.129
Even though the oddly-shaped skulls aren’t
on public display, if you ask to view them

00:13:33.129 --> 00:13:35.070
– you’ll likely be able to.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:41.579
Now that you know a bit about five of the
most mysterious fossil discoveries, what is

00:13:41.579 --> 00:13:42.579
your opinion?

00:13:42.579 --> 00:13:49.389
You probably agree when I say that we are
far from knowing all about mysterious creatures

00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:51.839
that roamed the Earth.
