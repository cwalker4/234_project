&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.

00:00:02.968 --> 00:00:05.438
WE'RE HERE WITH FORMER DEPUTY
DIRECTOR OF THE F.B.I., ANDREW

00:00:05.471 --> 00:00:08.741 align:start position:0%
McCABE, THE AUTHOR OF THE HIS
NEW BOOK "THE THREAT."

00:00:08.774 --> 00:00:12.912 align:start position:0%
WE HAVE LEARNED A FAIR AMOUNT
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS OF

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:18.384 align:start position:0%
FORMER DIRECTOR MUELLER'S
INVESTIGATION THROUGH SENTENCING

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:23.289
MEMOS, THROUGH COURT FILINGS.

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:25.291 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:28.594 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WE'VE LEARNED SOME
OF WHAT HE'S LEARNED.

00:00:28.627 --> 00:00:32.331
ARE THERE THINGS THAT YOU KNEW
THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN LEARNED IN

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:37.370
THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION BEFORE
YOU LEFT THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:40.373 align:start position:0%
DETAILS THAT WE HAVE NOT LEARNED
YET?

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:41.641 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; SURE.

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:44.510 align:start position:0%
THERE'S CERTAINLY INFORMATION --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT ARE THOSE

00:00:44.543 --> 00:00:45.578 align:start position:0%
THINGS?

00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:48.347 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )</i>
&gt;&gt; WELL... I, OF COURSE, CANNOT

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.282 align:start position:0%
DISCUSS THOSE THINGS.

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:54.754 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I MEAN, ARE THEY
LIKE A-RUG-A!

00:00:54.787 --> 00:00:56.189
ON A SCALE OF EH, TO A-RUG-A.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:59.492 size:78% position:39%
WHERE WOULD YOU PUT THEM?

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:06.466 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN
ESTIMATE YOUR A-RUG-A SCALE.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:11.104 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT GOES LIKE THIS, EH, AND
A-RUG-A.

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:11.971 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE.

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:14.607 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SOMEWHERE IN THE
MIDDLE.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.410 align:start position:0%
OKAY.

00:01:17.443 --> 00:01:25.351
SOME PEOPLE IN-- IN DEFENSE OF
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN

00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:26.986
CHARGED, IT'S A PROCESS CRIME.

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:28.554 size:84% position:42%
IT'S A PROCESS CRIME, ANDY.

00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:31.190 size:81% position:41%
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL, ANDY.

00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:32.391 align:start position:0%
IT'S PROCESS CRIMES.

00:01:32.424 --> 00:01:36.562
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO
SAY, THEY'RE PROCESS CRIMES?

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:39.031 align:start position:0%
YOU'RE NIT-PICKING.

00:01:39.064 --> 00:01:42.869
&gt;&gt; WHEN I WAS AN INVESTIGATION,
I DON'T ANY FEDERAL INVESTIGATOR

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
WOULD SAY TO YOU LYING TO A
FEDERAL INVESTIGATOR DURING THE

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.074 align:start position:0%
COURSE OF AN INVESTIGATION IS A
PROCESS CRIME.

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:51.344
WE TAKE THAT PRETTY SERIOUSLY.

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:54.080
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OF COURSE YOU TAKE
THAT SERIOUSLY, IT'S YOUR JOB.

00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:55.314 align:start position:0%
ARE YOU THE PROCESS.

00:01:55.347 --> 00:01:56.515 align:start position:0%
THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO
YOU.

00:01:56.548 --> 00:01:59.652
&gt;&gt; IF WE CAN'T COUNT ON, YOU
KNOW, THE INFORMATION WE GET WE

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:02.121 align:start position:0%
HAVE A HARDER TIME
INVESTIGATING.

00:02:02.154 --> 00:02:04.056
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ONE OF THE THINGS
ABOUT THIS BOOK-- WHICH, AGAIN,

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:05.892 align:start position:0%
I ENJOYED READING IT.

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:09.595
I RECOMMEND IT TO PEOPLE-- WE
GOT YOUR EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT OF

00:02:09.628 --> 00:02:13.833 align:start position:0%
MANY THINGS THAT WE ALREADY HAD
REPORTS ABOUT.

00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:14.901 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:18.171 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NOW, WE HEARD
RUMORS OR REPORTS, EITHER

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:20.239
THROUGH "THE NEW YORK TIMES" OR
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" OR

00:02:20.272 --> 00:02:23.609 align:start position:0%
"BUZZ FEED" OR "THE WASHINGTON
POST," OF WHAT HAPPENED IN

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:30.016 align:start position:0%
MEETINGS WITH DONALD TRUMP, WHAT
HAPPENED CONSIDERING THE

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.017 align:start position:0%
25th AMENDMENT.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.051 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:35.087 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THE-- THE NEED TO
GET ROBERT MUELLER.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.858 align:start position:0%
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS IN HERE
THEY ALREADY KNEW ABOUT.

00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:40.793
I GOT YOUR FRESH PERSPECTIVE ON
IT, AND I GOT AN IDEA OF WHAT IT

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:43.763 size:88% position:44%
FELT LIKE TO BE IN THE ROOM.

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:44.864 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; SURE.

00:02:44.897 --> 00:02:48.334 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE REPORTING ON THE

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:49.535 align:start position:0%
INVESTIGATION SO FAR?

00:02:49.568 --> 00:02:52.905
WE GET A LOT OF REPORTS FROM
"THE WASHINGTON POST," "THE NEW

00:02:52.938 --> 00:02:53.372 align:start position:0%
YORK TIMES."

00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:54.907 align:start position:0%
ARE THEY ACCURATE?

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.378
WHAT DO YOU THINK, IN GENERAL
BHOW FACTUAL THOSE REPORTS ARE?

00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:03.015 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT CALLS THEM
ALL "FAKE NEWS."

00:03:03.048 --> 00:03:07.253 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; I THINK A LOT OF THE-- I
THINK THE REPORTING HAS BEEN

00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:08.454 align:start position:0%
EXTRAORDINARY.

00:03:08.487 --> 00:03:11.924 align:start position:0%
I THINK THERE'S A-- THERE'S
CLEARLY AN-- I'VE NEVER SEEN THE

00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:15.761 align:start position:0%
LEVEL OF RESOURCES DEDICATED TO
THIS SORT OF WORK THAT YOU

00:03:15.794 --> 00:03:17.897 size:78% position:39%
CURRENTLY HAVE UNDER THIS
ADMINISTRATION, RIGHT.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.467 align:start position:0%
SO THE NUMBER AND SCOPE OF
REALLY TALENTED REPORTERS THAT

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.937 align:start position:0%
ARE-- THAT ARE WORKING ON THIS
TOPIC DAY IN, DAY OUT.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.673
AND THEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE
TO PEEL BACK THE ONION ON THE

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:30.710
FACTS THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO.

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:33.079 align:start position:0%
SOMETIMES NOT TO THE BENEFIT OF
THE INVESTIGATION.

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:36.048 align:start position:0%
SO AS AN INVESTIGATOR, IT'S
SOMETHING THAT CONCERNS YOU VERY

00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:40.253 align:start position:0%
MUCH, TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT
INVESTIGATIVE SENSITIVE

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:42.888 align:start position:0%
INFORMATION DOES NOT MAKE IT--
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THIS BOOK, OF

00:03:42.921 --> 00:03:44.022 align:start position:0%
COURSE, IS IN?

00:03:44.056 --> 00:03:46.058 align:start position:0%
WAYS ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION, AT
LEAST THE ORIGIN OF IT.

00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:48.995 align:start position:0%
IF YOU WERE STILL IN THE F.B.I.,
WOULD YOU WANT THIS BOOK OUT

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:49.629 align:start position:0%
THERE?

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:50.496 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:51.397 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THANK YOU.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.401 align:start position:0%
<i> ( LAUGHTER )</i>
&gt;&gt; AS AN INTERVIEWER, I

00:03:55.434 --> 00:03:56.469 size:84% position:42%
APPRECIATE A GOOD QUESTION.

00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:58.604 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YES, YES.

00:03:58.637 --> 00:04:02.208 align:start position:0%
<i> ( LAUGHTER )</i>
YOU'RE UNDER OATH, BY THE WAY.

00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:03.009 size:88% position:44%
YOU'RE UNDER OATH RIGHT NOW.

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:04.210 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:04:04.243 --> 00:04:05.945
YOU KNOW I WORKED VERY CLOSELY
WITH THE F.B.I. IN THE PROCESS

00:04:05.978 --> 00:04:07.513
OF GETTING THE BOOK PUBLISHED.

00:04:07.546 --> 00:04:10.016 size:88% position:44%
I'M REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THE
MANUSCRIPT TO THE F.B.I. FOR

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.518 align:start position:0%
WHAT THEY CALL PREPUBLICATION
REVIEW.

00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:13.552 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHY ARE YOU
REQUIRED TO?

00:04:13.585 --> 00:04:16.255 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE YOU WERE ACTUALLY FIRED
FROM THE F.B.I.

00:04:16.288 --> 00:04:17.456 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.959 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT DO YOU OWE
THE F.B.I. NOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN

00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:20.660 align:start position:0%
CUT LOOSE?

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:22.928
WHY CAN'T YOU SAY WHAT YOU WANT.

00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:24.196 size:84% position:42%
YOU DON'T OWE THEM NOTHING.

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.301
&gt;&gt; I AM STILL, BY VIRTUE OF THE
CLEARANCES I HAD IN MY POSITION,

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:32.405
I'M STILL OBLIGATED TO PROTECT
NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:34.573
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS THAT
GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS ENSURE

00:04:34.606 --> 00:04:35.608
THAT INFORMATION IS PROTECTED.

00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:37.376 size:78% position:39%
IT'S A PROCESS I RESPECT.

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:41.347 align:start position:0%
AND IT WAS-- IT TOOK A LONG TIME
AND A LOT OF WORK, BUT I'M

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.515 align:start position:0%
PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT THAT
CAME OUT.

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:45.418 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELL, AS AM I.

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:46.752 align:start position:0%
I ENJOYED IT.

00:04:46.785 --> 00:04:48.554 align:start position:0%
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING
HERE, DIRECTOR.

00:04:48.587 --> 00:04:49.655 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:04:49.688 --> 00:04:51.991 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: "THE THREAT" IS
AVAILABLE NOW.

00:04:52.024 --> 00:04:53.225 size:78% position:39%
ANDREW McCABE, EVERYBODY!

00:04:53.258 --> 00:04:55.928 align:start position:0%
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH
DAN LEVY.
