00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:09.234
For the first time ever has Danish TV been granted
access to a NATO warship out on live operations.

00:00:09.234 --> 00:00:16.208
For three months will the 150 men and women on board
Absalon fight pirates in the waters outside Somalia.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.567
For the Danish soldiers it will be 3 months of
action, hardships and unique solidarity.

00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:27.666
And we are along at the frontline
when Denmark goes pirate hunting.

00:00:27.697 --> 00:00:29.689
Pirate Hunt

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.236
Are you a pirate?

00:00:31.236 --> 00:00:33.416
Inhumane conditions to live in.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.638
I've learned not to take anything for granted.

00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:12.408
Pirate Hunt

00:01:16.185 --> 00:01:21.091
It's under two weeks until the crew
on Absalon is going home to Denmark.

00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:26.785
But before they can see their families
they have a huge task ahead of them.

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:28.981
The Warship has guests.

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:38.357
In the cells at the lower decks
sit 25 pirates that Absalon just -

00:01:38.357 --> 00:01:43.182
- moments ago captured in their biggest
operation during their entire deployment.

00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:54.836
The Somali pirates were heading out to capture
a merchant vessel when Absalon caught them.

00:01:54.836 --> 00:01:57.562
Permission to fire granted.

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:10.829
During the operation Absalon freed
14 Pakistani and Irani hostages.

00:02:13.798 --> 00:02:16.940
They have adjusted well
to their new temporary home.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.063
The roles have turned and the pirates
themselves are now behind bars.

00:02:29.263 --> 00:02:33.162
Even though Absalon has freed
hostages from a hijacked ship -

00:02:33.162 --> 00:02:36.248
- the case is like any other criminal case.

00:02:36.248 --> 00:02:40.982
The Somali's are only charged for
piracy until found guilty by a court.

00:02:41.756 --> 00:02:47.428
DJ, the leader for the Military Police,
therefore has a gigantic task ahead of him.

00:02:47.428 --> 00:02:50.906
He has to both gather
evidence for a trial -

00:02:50.906 --> 00:02:55.120
- and question the Somali's
about their criminal activities.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.573
Mike Papa here, come in.

00:02:58.573 --> 00:03:03.190
MP, can you confirm that we have
25 suspected pirates onboard?

00:03:04.198 --> 00:03:08.156
I can confirm,
just counted 25.

00:03:09.124 --> 00:03:12.437
Thanks,
are there any minors?

00:03:13.038 --> 00:03:16.100
Stand by, we'll check it now.

00:03:18.694 --> 00:03:21.022
We'll check for minors.

00:03:21.022 --> 00:03:24.342
It's important to find out how old
the suspected pirates are.

00:03:24.342 --> 00:03:28.748
If they're under 15 special care
has to be shown during  detention.

00:03:32.402 --> 00:03:34.097
14.

00:03:36.534 --> 00:03:37.724
13.

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:41.441
14.

00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:45.177
They're lying.
They lie like fuck.

00:03:45.246 --> 00:03:48.833
Absalons interpreter is masked
for security reasons.

00:03:48.943 --> 00:03:55.137
If he's recognized the pirates could try and
take revenge on him or his family.

00:03:55.137 --> 00:03:59.778
-He says he's 13.
-Like hell you're 13, you're older.

00:03:59.778 --> 00:04:03.200
So 7-8 says they are under 15.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.782
-As soon as they start talking...
-Yeah they lie like hell.

00:04:10.372 --> 00:04:14.724
Otherwise we will need a doctor
to confirm their age.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.930
Now they are going to sit there,
not allowed to talk -

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.841
- so they don't match up their story.

00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:29.661
You could see I asked how old they were, if you
say it in the open they all say they are under 15.

00:04:29.661 --> 00:04:34.669
They hope we'll put them ashore or something.

00:04:35.553 --> 00:04:38.103
While DJ questions the Somali's, -

00:04:38.103 --> 00:04:42.503
- his colleauges are on the Jelbut
looking for evidence of piracy.

00:04:42.764 --> 00:04:44.046
Here!

00:04:44.046 --> 00:04:49.642
The Frogmen have taken over the
boat and are sailing behind Absalon.

00:04:49.642 --> 00:04:53.275
-So you've finally made captain.
-Pirate captain!

00:04:53.275 --> 00:04:55.103
Some title.

00:04:55.103 --> 00:05:00.700
The Somali pirates seemingly threw all
their weapons over before surrendering.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.074
Among clothes and rests
of the narcotic Khat -

00:05:04.074 --> 00:05:08.816
- the Frogmen searches for weapons and things
that could be used in a case against the pirates.

00:05:08.816 --> 00:05:14.359
Charges for RPG-grenades.
In good condition.

00:05:14.359 --> 00:05:19.164
All of this is Khat.
They chew on it.

00:05:22.086 --> 00:05:29.284
We're very interrested in celll phones,
we can get a lot of information out of those.

00:05:32.288 --> 00:05:39.009
Captain Carsten arrives at the Jelbut to see the
damage the many rounds have inflicted on the boat.

00:05:41.058 --> 00:05:45.230
It could give him an idea about how to
place rounds in future operations.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:50.411
A bit surreal, on the one side we've
been keeping an eye on it for days, -

00:05:50.411 --> 00:05:54.738
- and in just 24 hours it changes dramatically.

00:05:54.738 --> 00:06:00.099
Now we stand here, the hostages
are safe and the pirates onboard.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.506
- Nice ship you got Christian.
- Yes, not too bad!

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:16.278
No doubt inhumane conditions to live in.

00:06:16.278 --> 00:06:22.897
You just have to keep in mind 39 people lived here.

00:06:22.897 --> 00:06:28.767
The majority being the 25 pirates while
the others were more or less slaves.

00:06:28.767 --> 00:06:34.080
So no doubt a hard period for them.
I can understand their joy getting out.

00:06:40.088 --> 00:06:42.979
As soon as the evidence against
the pirates are gathered -

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:45.048
- and witnesses give testimony, -

00:06:45.048 --> 00:06:50.150
- the plan is to put the Iranian and Pakistani fishers
back on their boat and let them sail home.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.830
While Absalon can sail
on to the Seychelles.

00:06:57.556 --> 00:07:00.853
The pirates were nummerized when
they were put in the cells.

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:03.869
02, 03, 06 are going
to have pictures taken.

00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:05.689
-2, 3, 6.
-Yes.

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:11.266
It's written on their bodies to both identify them
but to also to take away from their own identity -

00:07:11.266 --> 00:07:15.250
- so Absalons Military Police
can keep them in a state of shock.

00:07:16.723 --> 00:07:23.664
Any pirates who might be under 15 years old
have their wrists X-rayed.

00:07:23.664 --> 00:07:27.727
The small bones inside changes by age.

00:07:27.727 --> 00:07:31.557
And that way they can determine
the age of the suspected pirates.

00:07:32.484 --> 00:07:37.289
Based on their bone structure in their hand
we'll see if they are as young as they say.

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:40.142
Many times it turns out
they are much older...

00:07:45.397 --> 00:07:48.949
The doctor determines all the
Somali's are over 15 years.

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:52.105
And the questioning can begin.

00:07:52.105 --> 00:07:55.383
They can't themselves decide how
long that will take.

00:08:02.514 --> 00:08:06.328
Each suspected pirate is
registered and questioned.

00:08:06.328 --> 00:08:08.702
Are you a pirate?

00:08:08.702 --> 00:08:10.972
-No.
-No well.

00:08:10.972 --> 00:08:16.304
DJ is tasked with gathering all the information
that could be used agains them in a trial.

00:08:16.304 --> 00:08:17.757
My name is David.

00:08:19.984 --> 00:08:22.094
You were captured by a Danish warship.

00:08:25.078 --> 00:08:27.147
You're suspected for piracy.

00:08:29.435 --> 00:08:30.682
What's your name?

00:08:35.729 --> 00:08:41.442
It's routine that all suspected pirates
are photograhed and fingerprinted.

00:08:41.442 --> 00:08:44.056
They also look for certain characteristics.

00:08:44.056 --> 00:08:50.192
This could be relevant if Absalon arrests a pirate captured
by another NATO warship in an earlier operation.

00:08:50.192 --> 00:08:52.911
What was your function? Job?

00:08:57.995 --> 00:09:01.151
He was a worker.
Taking care of the fish.

00:09:04.565 --> 00:09:06.899
Are you a pirate?

00:09:12.095 --> 00:09:17.228
He says he is a farmer and
that he doesn't know about any piracy.

00:09:17.228 --> 00:09:19.133
I think you're full of lies!

00:09:20.327 --> 00:09:23.280
The hostages tell a completely different story.

00:09:27.788 --> 00:09:31.831
If the pirates are to be sentenced, the most
important evidence will be the witness statements.

00:09:34.347 --> 00:09:37.881
All the witnessess are therefore questioned
by Absalons military lawyer.

00:10:13.135 --> 00:10:19.213
Pakistani Jamal Khan can also tell how terrifying
it was to be prisoner on their own boat.

00:10:19.213 --> 00:10:24.759
Under the circumstances
we felt very helpless.

00:10:24.821 --> 00:10:29.196
We thought we were
going to die there and then.

00:10:29.258 --> 00:10:33.322
We worried about what our families
were thinking had happened to us.

00:10:33.322 --> 00:10:37.430
We couldn't contact them.
Everyone was worried.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:41.348
I expected it was hard.
That they were badly treated.

00:10:41.348 --> 00:10:46.423
But I had not expected they
were putting up mock executions.

00:10:46.423 --> 00:10:51.420
I had not expected shooting next to
their heads when they received water.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:56.678
They they were given water mixed with fuel.

00:10:56.678 --> 00:11:01.676
Being hit with rifle stocks etc.
Just one big terror regime.

00:11:20.864 --> 00:11:23.763
Somali face.

00:11:28.743 --> 00:11:31.095
While the hostages are relaxing
with training and games -

00:11:31.095 --> 00:11:33.881
- the suspected pirates are
going on their first walk.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:40.087
Stefan from the Military Police instructs the Boarding
team on how to get them safely into the missile silo.

00:11:40.087 --> 00:11:42.745
No looking around in the hangar.

00:11:42.745 --> 00:11:46.321
Up to the right and into the missile silo.

00:11:46.321 --> 00:11:49.695
And line them up agains the wall.
Start with these five first.

00:11:57.541 --> 00:12:00.260
Make sure they are always facing down.

00:12:16.422 --> 00:12:19.444
Attention Absalon!
Due to a walk in the yard -

00:12:19.444 --> 00:12:22.234
- all travel to the
missile well is forbidden.

00:12:24.547 --> 00:12:26.769
Keep looking down.

00:12:28.085 --> 00:12:30.061
The pirates are going with their heads down -

00:12:30.061 --> 00:12:32.554
- because they must not be
allowed to orientate on the boat.

00:12:32.554 --> 00:12:35.468
This is important in case they
suddenly try and escape.

00:12:35.468 --> 00:12:39.671
The 25 pirates are brought into Absalons missile silo.

00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:44.637
Here they can't see the ocean and orientate
how far the ship is from Somalia's coast.

00:12:44.637 --> 00:12:48.490
The missile silo is in addition the
most secure outdoor deck on Absalon.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:52.659
Which is important in case the pirates try
to run when their handcuffs come off.

00:12:53.188 --> 00:12:56.587
It's to get some air and movement.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.462
If they sit still too long down in the cells -

00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:05.564
- their intestines stop functioning
and they suffer from constipation

00:13:05.673 --> 00:13:11.511
It's also to give them a break from their
otherwise monotone presence in the cells.

00:13:15.345 --> 00:13:18.999
The Military Police has discovered one
of the pirates is a repeat offender.

00:13:21.522 --> 00:13:24.942
The same pirate was taken by
Absalon two months earlier.

00:13:29.631 --> 00:13:34.469
Here Absalon discovered 7 Somali's in a small Skiff.

00:13:40.212 --> 00:13:43.082
They threw a ladder in the water.

00:13:44.609 --> 00:13:47.164
But the pirates had already
thrown their weapons over board -

00:13:47.164 --> 00:13:52.674
- so Absalon detained them for five hours
before setting them free again.

00:13:55.328 --> 00:14:00.994
It may sound like a paradox to catch the
same people for piracy again and again.

00:14:00.994 --> 00:14:07.700
But that's the name of the game.
Ask a Somali, human life costs nothing.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:11.817
I think an Ak-47 is worth more
than two human lives in Somalia.

00:14:11.817 --> 00:14:15.231
And that's what you're up against.
That's where you really hurt the pirates.

00:14:15.231 --> 00:14:20.169
Their logistics, money,
boat, fuel, weapons, -

00:14:20.169 --> 00:14:23.591
- GPS, cell phones, everything
they use to commit piracy with.

00:14:23.591 --> 00:14:26.552
The humans are completely worthless.
Even if we capture -

00:14:26.552 --> 00:14:29.829
- 30 pirates and jail them,
60 new ones will just show up.

00:14:29.856 --> 00:14:30.911
That's just how it is.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:35.940
Captain Carsten also don't think this is the
last time Absalon will capture a pirate twice.

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:41.205
I think the desire to make the millions
make them try again and again.

00:14:41.205 --> 00:14:48.406
Which stresses the importance of our presence here,
even if it is just symptom treatment.

00:14:48.406 --> 00:14:53.050
If we relax our presence we will
just give the pirates free reign again.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:59.194
But with the prospects of dollars they can earn
they will be out here as fast as they can again.

00:15:16.158 --> 00:15:19.657
Pirate Hunt

00:15:20.079 --> 00:15:22.594
Pirate Hunt

00:15:27.274 --> 00:15:31.720
It's now a couple of days since Absalon
detained 25 suspected pirates.

00:15:32.712 --> 00:15:34.704
And even though the warship is in the other end -

00:15:34.704 --> 00:15:39.150
- it's still in the mission area
to carry out tasks for NATO.

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:44.892
Brumbass is therefore sent out every day to
gather information about pirate activity.

00:15:53.899 --> 00:15:58.260
-How far to target?
-Five minutes maximum.

00:16:04.362 --> 00:16:11.024
The helicopter flies out to take pictures of
pirate camp Grisby and the hijacked ships.

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:17.516
One of the hijacked ships is Albedo.

00:16:17.516 --> 00:16:20.602
Let's make sure we
don't get too close.

00:16:20.602 --> 00:16:25.024
The pirates here have been agressive
and threatened the crew on Brumbass.

00:16:26.609 --> 00:16:29.559
-He's standing with a weapon.
-Yeah.

00:16:29.559 --> 00:16:33.251
-Take us away KUB.
-Yeah away KUB.

00:16:35.165 --> 00:16:38.631
With this experience in mind Kir
reacts instinctivly -

00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:42.429
- when he suddenly sees smoke from
a weapon pointed against Brumbass.

00:17:11.532 --> 00:17:14.705
At the moment I observe these smoke clouds -

00:17:14.705 --> 00:17:19.777
- the pulse of course rises,
you talk extra fast and 'hard'.

00:17:19.777 --> 00:17:24.951
It all happens fast and you make
fast descisions to get out of there.

00:17:24.951 --> 00:17:29.996
You don't got time for much thinking
besides we're out of here.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:42.716
Brumbass is now safely back on Absalon,
no one was injured.

00:17:42.725 --> 00:17:46.190
It's important that the leadership
knows exactly what happened -

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.686
- so they can make the right
safety precaution measures.

00:17:48.686 --> 00:17:55.155
So we've got report that you observed something
that may have been a weapon being fired.

00:17:55.155 --> 00:18:00.413
I saw at least two clouds of smoke.

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:06.610
I think what happened was this
person somehow fired a weapon.

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:13.055
I don't know what it was but I'm
fairly sure it was a weapon -

00:18:13.055 --> 00:18:16.509
- because of those smoke clouds,
almost no doubt.

00:18:20.678 --> 00:18:24.655
The Somali's live five man per
7 square meters in the cells.

00:18:24.655 --> 00:18:30.286
After several days on Absalon the tight quarters
are starting to effect the suspected pirates.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:47.448
They're sitting with the cuffs on today because
there was a fight in the cells this morning.

00:18:47.448 --> 00:18:53.175
So until we know where we have them
they'll remain secured.

00:18:59.213 --> 00:19:03.807
Absalons Second in Command is on the other hand
making sure the hostages get to stretch their legs.

00:19:03.807 --> 00:19:07.436
Move over so we can let the Captain sit in the chair.

00:19:20.687 --> 00:19:24.872
Marie can you get the Skiff camera up here?

00:19:29.603 --> 00:19:31.837
The hostages are brought to the top deck -

00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:36.170
- where just a few days ago several
salvos were fired at their boat.

00:20:02.191 --> 00:20:05.105
In the missile silo the tour is soon over.

00:20:05.105 --> 00:20:08.039
And this suits boarding member Stine just fine.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.263
I don't like to look at them.

00:20:11.263 --> 00:20:13.185
Because I think they are...

00:20:13.211 --> 00:20:18.328
A bunch of ruffians who don't
deserve nice treatment like this.

00:20:18.328 --> 00:20:21.776
Considering what they have done.

00:20:26.563 --> 00:20:31.323
DJ also doesn't have much sympathy for the pirates
but he can understand their situation.

00:20:31.323 --> 00:20:34.925
We should keep in mind those we meet
in the boats are the little men, -

00:20:34.925 --> 00:20:39.776
- the big guys behind all this sit
on land and earn all the money.

00:20:39.776 --> 00:20:46.898
Those we encounter in the boats are just the henchmen,
who do this for not much more than just earning a living.

00:20:46.898 --> 00:20:49.937
I don't have sympathy or compassion for them, -

00:20:49.937 --> 00:20:52.758
- but I can understand their
reasoning for comitting piracy.

00:21:00.304 --> 00:21:03.297
While the Military Police have
control over the pirates -

00:21:03.297 --> 00:21:06.880
- Second in Command is going to have to work
a bit harder to communicate with the hostages.

00:21:09.255 --> 00:21:15.333
We talk a...
simple language with our friends.

00:21:15.333 --> 00:21:19.778
They ask where the Somali's are,
if they are imprisoned.

00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:25.602
We've talked a bit about missiles which is ...
Swoosh.

00:21:28.251 --> 00:21:33.308
And get out for some fresh air
and see their own boat, -

00:21:33.308 --> 00:21:40.047
- a Iranian ship as they say.

00:21:40.047 --> 00:21:46.716
Now we're going to see the engine room,
they ask about it all the time.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.315
Since Brumbass may have been fired upon -

00:21:52.315 --> 00:21:57.840
- the helicopter crew is interviewed
individually by intelligence officer Jens.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.046
What happened when you came up to the ship.

00:22:01.046 --> 00:22:07.269
His task is to establish the timeline and
evaluate the threat from the anchored ship.

00:22:08.142 --> 00:22:11.719
Kir is the most important one since
it was he that spottet the smoke.

00:22:11.719 --> 00:22:15.721
He stood up and. bent over
as we've seen many times before.

00:22:15.721 --> 00:22:19.478
Takes the RPG up.
Could clearly see it was an RPG.

00:22:19.478 --> 00:22:22.895
Walks towards the bridge wing
and aims on us.

00:22:22.895 --> 00:22:29.283
And I spot minimum two puffs
of smoke from where he stood.

00:22:29.283 --> 00:22:33.658
-From where?
-The bridge.

00:22:33.658 --> 00:22:37.678
I've talked with most involved
and gathered the pieces, -

00:22:37.678 --> 00:22:40.554
- and I've made an analysis.

00:22:41.125 --> 00:22:43.779
Kir is sure of what he saw.

00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:47.018
But the analysis officers have
also examined the video.

00:22:47.018 --> 00:22:53.559
If we slow down the tape and notice this man
standing with the unknown object.

00:22:53.559 --> 00:22:58.240
He bows down and
stands up again, -

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.581
- this time with a piece of cloth
he hangs up to dry.

00:23:02.581 --> 00:23:05.435
If a weapon was fired there.

00:23:06.421 --> 00:23:09.941
If we assume an RPG he would
not be able to do that.

00:23:09.941 --> 00:23:13.843
He would be out of it because
of the back blast and pressure.

00:23:13.843 --> 00:23:19.561
If it was an AK or PKM the other guy
would probably had looked at the guy firing.

00:23:19.561 --> 00:23:23.345
He does not, he ignores it totally.

00:23:23.345 --> 00:23:27.881
I therefore conclude it was
likely just some steam -

00:23:27.881 --> 00:23:33.442
- from some water he flushed over or
putting out something he was burning.

00:23:33.442 --> 00:23:38.176
I conclude it highly unlikely to be able
to spot a weapon fired from 1km distance.

00:23:38.176 --> 00:23:41.037
Thanks Jens,
any further notes?

00:23:46.447 --> 00:23:50.792
Even though the attack turned out
to be steam from laundry water, -

00:23:50.792 --> 00:23:54.736
- Kir is in no doubt it was the right descision
to get out from there in a hurry.

00:23:54.736 --> 00:23:59.263
If they fire they fire.
You have to expect the worst -

00:23:59.263 --> 00:24:04.826
- even though you find out otherwise afterwards.
The pictures aren't more worth than us.

00:24:04.826 --> 00:24:08.627
-Damn right they aren't.
-Right.

00:24:08.627 --> 00:24:12.322
We have a family we need
to come home to.

00:24:17.231 --> 00:24:21.167
It's dinner time for Absalon and
the suspected pirates.

00:24:21.167 --> 00:24:23.259
You can see they don't
have much space.

00:24:35.467 --> 00:24:40.518
Some of the pirates are tired of the conditions
and the Miltary Police's rough control.

00:24:40.518 --> 00:24:44.100
So they are being a little disobedient
and refusing to eat.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:49.207
We control everything about them here,
what they eat, when they go to the toilet, -

00:24:49.207 --> 00:24:52.722
- and intake of food is the only thing they can control.

00:24:52.722 --> 00:24:56.800
So they start a hunger strike.
But we're not going to do anything.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.742
If they become very ill they will be
brought to the hospital and given water -

00:25:00.742 --> 00:25:06.359
- and brought down again.
We're not going to force food into them.

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:19.454
Absalons crew have been dealing with the pirates and
hostages for the last few days and are becoming tired.

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:25.107
The last thing they need before they can put the
Iranian and Pakistani fishers back on their boat -

00:25:25.107 --> 00:25:29.160
- is to transport the pirates
attack vessels over to Absalon.

00:25:29.683 --> 00:25:32.359
The two Skiffs are important evidence.

00:25:32.359 --> 00:25:35.136
But the operation is made difficult
because of rough waves.

00:25:39.344 --> 00:25:43.305
Help me hook this.

00:25:43.305 --> 00:25:49.302
We need to get it as safely
into the water as possible.

00:25:49.302 --> 00:25:55.853
It could land upside down and
then we'd have a problem.

00:25:56.199 --> 00:25:59.707
It's Kim that's going to make sure
the Skiff lands properly on the water -

00:25:59.707 --> 00:26:04.419
- so that the crew in the RIB can catch
the rope and tow the Skiff to Absalon.

00:26:04.933 --> 00:26:10.115
The two Skiffs could sink if they land upside down
when the Frogmen throw them over board.

00:26:11.256 --> 00:26:15.646
We are getting ready to
throw the skiff over -

00:26:15.683 --> 00:26:20.449
- with ropes attached so
Absalon can tow them.

00:26:21.871 --> 00:26:25.551
Big brother to Little sister,
Stand-by on the Jelbut.

00:26:25.551 --> 00:26:28.730
This is Big brother,
that is correct.

00:26:31.371 --> 00:26:34.878
Stern first and then
we just push.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.097
Ready?
Wait for the wave.

00:26:55.439 --> 00:26:58.509
First one, it's turning upside down!

00:26:59.312 --> 00:27:01.851
Can we save the rope before...?

00:27:06.928 --> 00:27:09.132
Can you get the rope?

00:27:09.132 --> 00:27:12.501
Fasten it!

00:27:12.501 --> 00:27:15.572
-Got it?
-Yes.

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:21.228
Silence on channel 24 now.
Big brother to Little sister.

00:27:21.228 --> 00:27:24.976
We got the Skiff tied to our boat
but it's sunk.

00:27:24.976 --> 00:27:27.163
Copy that.

00:27:27.163 --> 00:27:31.968
It's not possible to save it.

00:27:31.968 --> 00:27:36.226
-Copy that.
-I think it is sinking.

00:27:36.226 --> 00:27:38.415
Ok let it go.

00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:41.446
Let go Ana.

00:27:51.214 --> 00:27:55.666
Meanwhile the hostages have reached
Absalons giant engine room.

00:28:15.235 --> 00:28:21.102
Back on the Jelbut the Frogmen are ready to
throw over the pirates second attack boat.

00:28:21.102 --> 00:28:24.260
It's important that this one doesn't sink as well.

00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:30.391
This is Absalon. Can you lower the Skiff -

00:28:30.391 --> 00:28:32.883
- so it doesn't sink straight away.

00:28:32.883 --> 00:28:36.493
Yeah we're tying a rope to it.

00:28:36.493 --> 00:28:40.125
Watch out you don't get squeezed.

00:28:46.345 --> 00:28:48.900
Good enough?

00:28:50.502 --> 00:28:53.951
Duty chief here,
it's floating at least.

00:28:56.951 --> 00:29:02.193
You have to let it go!
Otherwise we can't grab it.

00:29:02.193 --> 00:29:06.928
I simply don't understand
what's going on over there.

00:29:10.162 --> 00:29:13.897
Unfortunately the first Skiff sunk.

00:29:13.897 --> 00:29:23.483
But as you can see we got the second one
so they are going to bring it to Absalon.

00:29:23.483 --> 00:29:28.069
And hoist it inside, then we are
going to bring the Skiff engines.

00:29:28.069 --> 00:29:31.299
Load them over in the RIB.

00:29:31.723 --> 00:29:35.481
So some work left.

00:29:35.481 --> 00:29:38.895
The pirates attack boat is now going
to be hoisted up inside Absalon.

00:29:38.895 --> 00:29:40.825
A task not without danger.

00:29:40.825 --> 00:29:46.591
Feel free to lower the hook a bit
before we come closer to you.

00:29:46.591 --> 00:29:50.067
Bit more down!

00:29:50.067 --> 00:29:52.749
Let go! More down!

00:29:52.749 --> 00:29:55.358
Up! Up!

00:29:55.358 --> 00:29:58.514
Bit up! There!
You got it!

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:07.641
Now they just need to bring the
engines over to Absalon -

00:30:07.641 --> 00:30:12.243
- and the last piece of evidence is secured.
But that doesn't happen without problems as well.

00:30:12.243 --> 00:30:15.790
Ready? Ok we're coming in!

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:21.001
Down down. Ok I had not accounted for that sorry.

00:30:21.001 --> 00:30:25.079
It's not fucking ok that we're stuck to this engine now!

00:30:25.079 --> 00:30:27.975
Fucking seamanship of the lowest order.

00:30:29.374 --> 00:30:32.147
We're sailing with water out of the boat.
Take it easy now.

00:30:32.147 --> 00:30:35.671
The engine is now on Absalon.
It will be used as evidence.

00:30:35.671 --> 00:30:41.429
So the operation went ok,
we lost one Skiff but it happens.

00:30:47.645 --> 00:30:50.348
But I've also learned not to
take anything for granted.

00:30:55.082 --> 00:31:01.703
Pirate Hunt

00:31:06.906 --> 00:31:11.688
The 14 hostages Absalon freed
have now been on the ship 5 days.

00:31:11.688 --> 00:31:18.428
It's not long before Absalon is in a position where
they can sail home on their own with their boat Tahiri.

00:31:21.514 --> 00:31:25.082
The captain prepares an official
farewell with the hostages.

00:31:25.082 --> 00:31:28.026
Carsten wants to make sure the
rest of the way home to Iran -

00:31:28.026 --> 00:31:32.473
- is as safe as possible after
the last few months dread.

00:32:29.528 --> 00:32:34.607
We are changing the name of
the boat from Tahiri to Denmark.

00:32:41.861 --> 00:32:46.932
For the freed Pakistanis and Iranians it will
be good to come back to their own ship again.

00:32:46.932 --> 00:32:50.810
In 7 days they will be reunited with their families.

00:32:56.051 --> 00:33:04.759
We have told the captain where we are
and he is happy to return to his ship now.

00:33:05.889 --> 00:33:09.583
From here they can reach the
island Socotra by Africa's Horn.

00:33:09.583 --> 00:33:14.476
It's familiar waters not far away
where they can easily sail home.

00:33:29.058 --> 00:33:35.484
Martin gives the hostages a phone so they can
phone Absalon every day and say they are ok.

00:33:35.484 --> 00:33:38.618
Because there could be pirates
in the waters on their way home.

00:34:46.643 --> 00:34:52.941
After two months imprisonment and fear
the 14 fishers can finally return home.

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:58.256
I like the fact that we secure
the waters before we say goodbye, -

00:34:58.282 --> 00:35:03.267
- so they don't risk meeting pirates
after a couple days at sea.

00:35:03.351 --> 00:35:10.114
But we can't do much more from Socotra,
they will just have to stay away from pirate waters.

00:35:26.365 --> 00:35:32.283
None of the 25 pirates have gone into a real
hunger strike, but their faiths remain uncertain.

00:35:32.283 --> 00:35:39.161
They are innocent until found guilty by a court,
but it's not certain they will ever face a judge.

00:35:39.161 --> 00:35:49.061
It's up to Denmark to make a deal with either the
Seychelles or Kenya to take them and prosecute them.

00:35:49.061 --> 00:35:59.012
In my mind there's no doubt that that Dhow was
hijacked by some of the pirates we have in our cells.

00:35:59.012 --> 00:36:04.719
There's also no doubt they left with the
intent to hijack a merchant vessel.

00:36:04.719 --> 00:36:10.761
And that they have threatened the hostages with
weapons on their life, and treated them miserably -

00:36:10.761 --> 00:36:14.631
- and brutaly, almost torture like.

00:36:14.631 --> 00:36:18.823
And we have very strong testimony on this.

00:36:18.823 --> 00:36:24.950
But that's my assesment as a layman,
I can of course hope for a prosecution.

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:32.098
But how will the country where the
trial takes place see the evidence?

00:36:32.098 --> 00:36:38.297
I hope it's strong enough, but I have also
learned never to take anything for granted.

00:36:38.297 --> 00:36:40.794
Because it's not black and white.

00:36:43.684 --> 00:36:49.984
Now it's time to come home and in less than 24 hours
the crew will be reunited with their families again.

00:36:57.722 --> 00:37:02.385
Three months pirate hunt is almost
over for the crew on Absalon.

00:37:02.385 --> 00:37:06.026
It's been a mission with its ups and downs.

00:37:06.026 --> 00:37:14.256
We have focused on detering pirate attacks,
prevent pirate attacks and disarm pirates.

00:37:14.256 --> 00:37:19.138
And in the situations we have had
I think we have succeeded.

00:37:19.138 --> 00:37:24.475
Of course you will find small things where this could
have been done better or this could have been adjusted.

00:37:24.475 --> 00:37:29.864
But I think the crew has delivered
and I'm proud on their behalf.

00:37:29.864 --> 00:37:38.553
In the long run Carsten would have liked for the Danish
Frogmen to carry out raids on the pirate camps on land.

00:37:38.553 --> 00:37:42.841
Here they could have obstructed the pirates by
destroying their attack boats and fuel depots.

00:37:42.841 --> 00:37:48.220
It's not talk about invading Somalia, -

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:57.257
- but it is based on the intelligence we have
gathered and where we have isolated pirate camps.

00:37:57.257 --> 00:38:06.677
I think we with great certainty could have gone in
and really limited the pirates ability to go to sea.

00:38:07.849 --> 00:38:13.657
Carsten now hands over his ship to the next crew
under leadership of Commander Captain Anders Friis.

00:38:13.657 --> 00:38:18.975
It will be their task to watch over the 25 pirates
until their faiths have been decided.

00:38:21.927 --> 00:38:27.244
Even though Stine is happy to have come home
everything isn't rose red.

00:38:31.105 --> 00:38:36.564
Always sweet to come home.
One thing is to interrupt your daily life -

00:38:36.564 --> 00:38:42.215
- and go out,
?? -

00:38:42.215 --> 00:38:47.331
- you also leave your friends,
your family and your boyfriend.

00:38:47.331 --> 00:38:55.852
They keep with their daily routine while you
suddenly appear saying "Tjohei I'm here again!"

00:38:55.852 --> 00:39:01.403
The Military Police leader has had some
mighty busy days with the pirates.

00:39:01.403 --> 00:39:08.595
In Copenhagen airport waits his family.
His daughter is especially excited to have him home.

00:39:08.595 --> 00:39:13.584
I think she looks forward to it.

00:39:13.584 --> 00:39:18.043
I think she's missed her father,
or that's what she has expressed at least.

00:39:27.106 --> 00:39:33.184
As heartfelt it is to say farewell to your family
as overwhelming is it to see them again.

00:39:34.227 --> 00:39:40.706
Being able to give them a big hug and
feeling their presence is just great.

00:39:42.993 --> 00:39:45.310
Want some chewing gum?

00:39:47.602 --> 00:39:52.696
Looking very forward to it.
I'll get my luggage and go out.

00:39:52.696 --> 00:39:57.335
Get home, take off my uniform and
be done for this time. It's great.

00:40:04.948 --> 00:40:06.988
Should be here.

00:40:18.535 --> 00:40:23.368
You're just as suntaned as before, dad!
Yes, just as suntaned as before...

00:40:28.662 --> 00:40:30.556
I've missed you so much.

00:40:47.623 --> 00:40:51.888
Three months as chief for all
of Absalons crew is over.

00:40:51.888 --> 00:40:55.044
Now the family waits just outside the door.

00:40:55.044 --> 00:40:58.642
Even though the farewell is hard,
I never get used to it, -

00:40:58.642 --> 00:41:05.607
- it's also incredibly important because you leave
with your crew on a task and a journey, -

00:41:05.607 --> 00:41:11.586
- so you have a lot of things to think on while at the
same time saying goodbye which is hard enough on its own.

00:41:14.512 --> 00:41:20.637
But the homecoming is different,
coming home seeing your airport, -

00:41:20.637 --> 00:41:25.559
- and see all those happy
faces makes it all worth it.

00:41:25.559 --> 00:41:27.349
It's absolutely a highlight.

00:41:57.175 --> 00:41:58.878
We're going home Dennis.

00:41:58.878 --> 00:42:02.437
There's no pirates around the corners here,
just good and warm people -

00:42:02.437 --> 00:42:12.869
- so I will just spend the time getting used to
not being in character and making descisions.

00:42:12.869 --> 00:42:16.155
I'll leave it to these three.

00:42:16.931 --> 00:42:23.131
As of the end of this documentary four pirates
were in jail in the Seychelles awaiting prosecution, -

00:42:23.131 --> 00:42:25.774
- with another four jailed in Kenya, -

00:42:25.774 --> 00:42:32.895
- but Denmark was not able to find a country for the
remaining 17 pirates who were set free on Somalia's coast.

00:42:32.895 --> 00:42:37.551
The 14 hostages safely reached home with
their newly named boat 'Denmark'.
