00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.440
ANTONY DAVIES: Myths about the government
debt.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.180
Myth number one, the government owes 20 trillion dollars.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.610
How much is 20 trillion dollars?

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.700
Suppose you go to Germany, and in Germany,
you go to every town.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.750
In every town, you visit every store.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.420
In every store, you look at every shelf and
grab everything that is for sale.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.189
The amount of money you spend will not be
$20 trillion.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.910
If you go to Germany and then to France and
you go to every town, and within every town,

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:37.910
you go to every store.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.870
In every store, you look on every shelf and
you buy everything.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.399
You still will not have spent $20 trillion.

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.950
You can go to England and while you're there,
you can go to the North Countries and buy

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.950
everything that's for sale, and you still
will not have spent $20 trillion.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.309
In fact, to spend $20 trillion, you have to
go to every country in Europe, visit every

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.860
town, in every town, go to every store.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.899
In every store, look on every shelf and buy
everything.

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.020
And then you will have spent about $20 trillion.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.620
But the myth is that this is how much money
the government owes.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.080
It turns out that there's more, called unfunded
obligations.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.860
Unfunded obligations is money the Federal
Government has promised but which it does

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.320
not and will not have the money to pay.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.180
Largely, this consists of promises of retirement
and medical benefits.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.930
If you would take the present value of all
the future promises of retirement and medical

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.180
benefits the government has made and subtract
from that the amount of money that's in the

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.439
government's Social Security and Medicare
trust funds, and then subtract from that the

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.450
amount of money the Federal Government anticipates
collecting under the current law from future

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.630
Social Security and Medicare taxes, you will
still have an amount of money left over that

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.640
the government does not have.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.799
And that's the unfunded obligations, an amount
of money the government has promised, which

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.049
it does not and will not have the money to
pay.

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.400
Estimates of unfunded obligations vary from
the astronomical to the unbelievable.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.469
On the low end, people have estimated unfunded
obligations to be about $80 trillion, on the

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.709
high end, $200 trillion.

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.390
This means that the Federal Government's total
financial obligations range somewhere from

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.209
100 to $220 trillion.

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.879
Let's say, roughly speaking, the Federal Government
owes about $150 trillion.

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.040
Myth number two, the government owes $150
trillion.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.449
Well, it turns out there's more to it.

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:41.419
There are federal agencies that don't appear
on the Federal Government's budget.

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:46.230
There are government-sponsored enterprises
like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that don't

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.689
appear on the government's financial statements,
and they owe another $8 trillion.

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:58.310
There's then state and local governments that
collectively owe about $3 trillion and have

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.059
another 5 trillion in their own unfunded obligations.

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:08.669
When we put it all together, the total US
governmental financial obligations total about

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:12.069
$165 trillion.

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.370
Myth number three, government borrowed from
the Social Security trust fund isn't really

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.340
debt because we owe it to ourselves.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.689
Well, it turns out there is no ourselves here.

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:26.790
The trust fund belongs to current and future
retirees.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.299
So when people retire and the government does
not have the money that it has promised them,

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.439
one of two things must happen.

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:40.629
Either the government must increase taxes
on future workers to pay for the Social Security

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.709
and Medicare obligations it has promised,
or the government has to cut the promised

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.739
Social Security and Medicare benefits that
it had promised to retirees.

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.909
Either way, someone must pay.

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.689
Myth number four, the government can't go
bankrupt.

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:00.689
This is technically true because the government
promised to pay back a certain number of dollar

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:01.689
bills.

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:07.290
And so as the government starts to run out
of money, it can simply print more, thereby

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.529
satisfying its obligation.

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:15.829
But while that's technically true, it's effectively
false because when the government prints money,

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:21.180
it erodes the purchasing power of dollars,
thereby creating inflation.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.199
For example, suppose you have a bunch of people
and these people buy things.

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.750
They buy things from Wal Mart, from Mcdonald's,
and Ford.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.479
In buying these things, they give these businesses
money.

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.110
In return, they receive goods and services
from these businesses.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.409
The ratio of the dollars they pay to the goods
and services they receive, we call prices.

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:45.479
We have the average price of a hamburger,
the average price of a pair of shoes, the

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:46.830
average price of a car.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.229
Now, if the government were to print enough
money to double the money supply, we would

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:56.220
have twice as many dollar bills floating around
but the same amount of goods and services.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.919
All that would happen is the prices of these
goods and services themselves would double.

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.330
With twice as many dollar bills, a hamburger
now goes from a price of $4 to a price of

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.330
8.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.330
The car goes from $30,000 to a price of $60,000.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.120
One of the prices that will double is people's
wages.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.580
Interestingly, you're left with the following.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.990
Under scenario one, without the government
printing money, let's suppose you earn $50,000

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.419
a year and the price of a hamburger, shoes,
and a car, things you would buy, are $4, $30,

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.050
and $30,000.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.039
And then along comes a government who prints
lots of money, and in printing the money,

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:35.229
it doubles all the prices, including your
income.

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:41.050
So now, in scenario two, you're earning twice
as much as you were before, $100,000, but

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.840
the prices of the things you buy have all
doubled as well.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.139
If I ask you, are you better off in scenario
one or scenario two, the answer is you're

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:51.479
the same in both.

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:56.730
It doesn't matter to you whether you're earning
$50,000 and a car costs 30, or whether you're

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.340
earning $100,000 and a car costs 60.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.660
It's the same car.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.530
Now, there is a difference in the two scenarios,
and the difference shows up when you look

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.009
at your savings.

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:12.389
Let's suppose, in scenario one, you had $10,000
in savings, you're earning $50,000, and a

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.550
hamburger costs $4.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.949
Along comes the government, it prints money.

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:19.629
In printing money, all the prices double.

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:24.139
That means that the hamburger now costs twice
as much, the shoes cost twice as much, you're

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:28.729
earning twice as much, but your savings is
the same.

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:32.379
It's the same $10,000 sitting in savings.

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:36.419
What has happened, when the government comes
along and prints money, in effect, what it's

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:42.319
doing is draining away the purchasing power
of your savings.

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:46.469
Economists say it this way, "Inflation is
a tax on savings."

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:52.979
When the government prints money and thereby
creates inflation, we get the same exact effect

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:57.340
as if the government had imposed a tax on
people's savings.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.580
The fact is that the government ultimately
pays for bankruptcy by taxing the purchasing

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.580
power of people's savings.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:09.349
Myth number five, the government can solve
its financial problems by raising taxes.

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:14.659
Well, it turns out the government can't raise
taxes at all, it can only raise tax rates.

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:19.729
Taxes are what happens when the tax rate that
the government impose interacts with people's

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:21.090
behavior.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.499
This is perhaps the most interesting picture
in all of economics.

00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:28.060
It's interesting precisely because it's so
boring.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.590
What you're seeing here is federal tax receipts.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:38.310
This is all tax revenue from all sources combined,
payroll taxes, income taxes, estate taxes,

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:44.319
tariffs, everything, federal taxes, all sources
combined, as a fraction of GDP.

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:49.569
What you see is, from 1950 up to the present,
this has remained relatively stable at about

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:51.389
17%.

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:58.090
That is, over time, if you think of the economy
as a pie, the government has collected a constant

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.919
17% slice of this economic pie.

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:06.949
Now, let's superimpose on top of this, for
example, the top marginal income tax rate.

00:08:06.949 --> 00:08:11.430
Back in the 1950s, the top marginal income
tax rate was north of 90%.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:16.249
It dropped in the 1960s, reached an all-time
low during the Reagan years, goes back up

00:08:16.249 --> 00:08:19.319
during Bush the first, comes back down, goes
back up again.

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:21.030
This is the top marginal income tax rate.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:25.719
When you talk about taxing the rich, this
is the rate that applies to the rich.

00:08:25.719 --> 00:08:27.749
But notice what happens here.

00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:32.180
In years in which we taxed the rich at a very
high rate, the government collected 17% of

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.120
the economy as tax revenue.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.380
In years in which we lowered the tax rate
on the rich, the government still collected

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.440
17% of the economy as tax revenue.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.889
The same is true of, for example, the capital
gains rate.

00:08:44.889 --> 00:08:48.721
When capital gains taxes were particularly
high, the government collected 17% of the

00:08:48.721 --> 00:08:50.430
economy as tax revenue.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:54.500
When capital gains taxes were particularly
low, the government collected 17% of the economy

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.170
as tax revenue.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.850
The same is true of the average effective
corporate tax rate.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:05.980
When corporations paid higher fractions of
their profits to the Federal Government, the

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.079
Federal Government collected 17% of the economy
as tax revenue.

00:09:09.079 --> 00:09:13.639
When tax rates on corporations were lower,
the government still collected the same 17%

00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:15.990
of the economy as tax revenue.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:21.940
It didn't matter whether we taxed the rich
or capital gains or corporations.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.130
It didn't matter whether we taxed them a high
amount or we taxed them a low amount.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:29.660
Regardless of what the government has done,
historically, it has consistently collected

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.949
the same 17% of the economy as tax revenue.

00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:37.949
Now, you might say, "All right, but we're
looking at tax revenue as a fraction of GDP.

00:09:37.949 --> 00:09:41.930
Tell me what's happening to tax revenue, straight
up."

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.540
Let's look at what happens to tax revenue
as tax rates change.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.860
What you see here is the top marginal income
tax rate.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.709
This is data from 1940 to 2015.

00:09:51.709 --> 00:09:55.959
Across the bottom as we move to the right,
we're taxing the rich at a higher rate.

00:09:55.959 --> 00:09:58.500
As we move to the left, we're taxing the rich
at a lower rate.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.930
Up and down, we're measuring tax revenue per
person, one year later.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:08.230
This is total federal tax revenue on a per
capita basis, one year after the tax rate

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:12.680
goes into effect, and this is all adjusted
for inflation.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.910
The story we hear when we hear things like,
"Well, we need more tax revenue so we need

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:22.920
to tax the rich more," implicit in that statement
is as you increase the tax rate on the rich,

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.380
we will collect more tax revenue.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.079
But if we actually look at the data, what
we see is a different picture.

00:10:29.079 --> 00:10:31.310
The actual data looks like this.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:36.839
On average, as we have increased the tax rate
on the rich, one year later, the Federal Government

00:10:36.839 --> 00:10:40.820
has actually collected, on average, less tax
revenue.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:46.300
There are exceptions to this but there's also
a very clear trend that the tax revenue moves

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.589
in the opposite direction that we think it
should.

00:10:49.589 --> 00:10:52.680
This is not just true of the top marginal
income tax rate.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.769
We also see it if we look at the capital gains
tax rate.

00:10:55.769 --> 00:11:00.910
Now, the relationship here is not as tight
but it's disturbingly in the same direction.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:05.949
On average, as the government has increased
the capital gains tax rate, one year later,

00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:09.420
it has collected less tax revenue than it
did before.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:12.410
We see the same phenomenon with the corporate
profits tax.

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.540
We see the same thing with the estate tax.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:21.800
In fact, of all the federal taxes, I'm only
aware of two which, historically, as the government

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:26.589
has increased these tax rates, its tax revenue
has actually gone up.

00:11:26.589 --> 00:11:30.540
Those two taxes are Social Security and Medicare.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:35.720
The disturbing part of this is these are the
taxes that fall most heavily on the poor and

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.160
the middle class.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.210
Myth number six, the rich aren't paying their
fair share.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:43.820
What constitutes a fair share?

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:50.230
What you see here is average market income
of various income groups in the United States

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:51.970
as of 2013.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.860
We have the poorest 20% of Americans at the
top.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:12:00.000
Their market income, that is income they earn
from participating in market activities as

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.940
opposed to money the government gives them,
their market income is about $15,800 on average.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:11.160
Here's the middle-income Americans, their
average income is about $53,000, and the top

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.660
1%, just over $1.5 million.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.800
Let's ask, what is a fair tax rate for these
people to pay?

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.269
As we talk about tax rates, let's talk about
effective tax rates.

00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:29.209
What I mean by that is after you have done
all of your legal and accounting gymnastics

00:12:29.209 --> 00:12:35.000
and write-offs and deductions and exemptions,
when all that's finished, what fraction of

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.509
your income did you end up paying to the IRS?

00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:41.130
That's the effective tax rate.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.670
We can argue about what constitutes fair.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:48.529
A lot of people tend to answer the following
way, the poor should probably pay somewhere

00:12:48.529 --> 00:12:49.529
around 2%.

00:12:49.529 --> 00:12:54.250
A lot of people think that the middle-class
Americans should pay around 15%.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:59.800
And a lot of people think that the top 1%
should pay around 30% of their income as taxes.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.980
Now, we could argue about whether these things
are indeed fair but these seem to be numbers

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.440
that lots of people will tend to agree with.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.950
Let's look at what these groups actually pay.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:14.139
If we look at the federal taxes collected
from each of these groups, we see something

00:13:14.139 --> 00:13:15.500
like the following.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:21.040
The average household amongst the poorest
20% of Americans pays, on average, $800 in

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.610
federal taxes.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:27.819
The average middle-income household in the
United States pay about $9,000 in taxes.

00:13:27.819 --> 00:13:33.019
The average household amongst the top 1% pays
about half-a-million dollars in federal taxes.

00:13:33.019 --> 00:13:38.949
Now, this isn't the end of the story because
we don't just pay money to the Federal Government,

00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:41.230
the Federal Government also gives money back.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:48.319
A lot of this comes in the form of the earned
income tax credit or Social Security benefits

00:13:48.319 --> 00:13:54.230
or unemployment compensation, but all of these
things are instances in which the government

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:59.069
has first collected money and then turned
around and given the money back.

00:13:59.069 --> 00:14:02.980
Let's account for this, and economists call
this transfers.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.269
Transfers are money the government gives to
people.

00:14:06.269 --> 00:14:11.770
The average household amongst the poorest
20% received an average federal transfer of

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.949
about $9,600 in 2013.

00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:19.470
The average middle-income household received
about $16,700.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:24.360
The average top 1%-er earned about $800, most
of that is likely coming from Social Security

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.970
retirement benefits.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:31.720
But notice what happens now, if we calculate
the effective tax rate by accounting not just

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.610
for what people pay to the government but
for the money the government pays them back,

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:38.610
what we find is something astounding.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:43.940
We claimed that a fair tax rate for the poorest
Americans is 2%, and a fair tax rate for the

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.250
top 1% is 30%.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:50.870
If we run these numbers, what we find is the
poorest 20%, on average, are actually paying

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.110
-56%.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:57.980
That is, when all the dust settles, they're
actually receiving more money back from the

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.519
Federal Government than they paid in the first
place, making their effective tax rate below

00:15:02.519 --> 00:15:03.690
zero.

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.950
This is true all the way up through middle-income
American.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:10.959
The average middle-income American is receiving
back 15% more from the Federal Government

00:15:10.959 --> 00:15:14.680
than he paid in, the top 1%-er paying about
34%.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.959
Here, we have an interesting conclusion.

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:24.589
On average, and there are exceptions but on
average, only the top 40% are net payers into

00:15:24.589 --> 00:15:26.060
the Federal Government.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:31.410
This raises an interesting point because every
time someone says, "Well, we should cut taxes,"

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:36.029
someone else responds with, "Well, you mean
tax cuts for the rich."

00:15:36.029 --> 00:15:41.689
But in fact, our tax system, at least at the
federal level, has become so progressive that

00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:47.009
virtually every tax cut, by definition, is
a tax cut for the rich because on average,

00:15:47.009 --> 00:15:49.830
those are the only people who are actually
paying.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:54.680
Myth number seven, the government can settle
its debts by selling off its assets.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:59.439
The government has some debts and unfunded
obligations of about $150 trillion but it's

00:15:59.439 --> 00:16:05.070
also sitting on a bunch of assets, 8,000 tons
of gold in Fort Knox, 500 million acres of

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:10.139
land out in the West and Midwest, and then
miscellaneous assets on top of that.

00:16:10.139 --> 00:16:14.449
These total actually only about 2 or $3 trillion.

00:16:14.449 --> 00:16:18.680
When we're done, even if the Federal Government
were to sell off all of its assets, we still

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.879
have a shortfall of $147 trillion.

00:16:22.879 --> 00:16:25.970
Myth number eight, the government needs to
pay off its debts.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:29.889
The good news here is the government actually
doesn't need to pay off its debt.

00:16:29.889 --> 00:16:35.089
Just as a household with a credit card does
not have to pay off the credit card, all it

00:16:35.089 --> 00:16:39.750
has to do is keep up with the minimum monthly
payments, so too the government only needs

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:42.750
to keep up with its minimum monthly payments.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:45.050
We call this servicing the debt.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:51.050
The bad news is if we count all of the money
the Federal Government owes, $150 trillion,

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:58.040
and the Federal Government currently pays
about 2.5% on its debt, to service the full

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:03.149
$150 trillion of obligations, the Federal
Government would have to come up with $3.8

00:17:03.149 --> 00:17:04.980
trillion per year.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:09.820
That is, to service the debt and obligations
the Federal Government currently has, it would

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:13.980
have to pay $3.8 trillion a year in interest.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:19.910
Yet, the Federal Government's annual income
is only about 3.3 trillion.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:23.710
That is, the Federal Government actually is
bankrupt right now.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:31.330
Even if it were to devote all of the tax revenue
it collects solely to servicing its $150 trillion

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:36.690
in debt and obligations, it still would not
have enough money to service that debt.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:40.380
Myth number nine, well, the government could
just keep on borrowing.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:45.340
The problem here is the government has borrowed
so much money that it's running out of places

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.630
to find more.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:51.650
Currently, the American people, state and
local governments have loaned about $6 trillion

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:52.960
to the Federal Government.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:58.900
Social Security, Medicare, Veterans Benefits
trust funds have loaned about $5 trillion

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.570
to the Federal Government.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.030
Foreign governments have loaned another 4
trillion.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:08.280
The Federal Reserve has loaned 3 trillion,
and foreign people have loaned about 2 trillion.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.230
This is the total amount of money that people
the world over have loaned to the Federal

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.230
Government.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:17.280
The problem with this is Social Security,
Medicare, Veterans Benefits trust funds have

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.670
run out of money.

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:21.470
They have no more left to loan to the Federal
Government.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:26.750
In fact, in the case of Social Security and
Medicare, they're starting to pull back the

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:30.480
money that they had loaned to the Federal
Government, which they now need to turn over

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.800
to retirees in the form of benefits.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.530
Foreign governments and foreign people have
been slowing the growth of their lending to

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:37.680
the Federal Government.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.400
The American people, state and local governments
have been slowing, and in some cases, actually

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.900
cutting back on how much they loan the Federal
Government.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.720
That means that as time moves forward and
the Federal Government wants to borrow more

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:53.530
and more money and these groups are all tending
to cut back on how much they loan, the one

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:58.040
place left the Federal Government can turn
to for money is the Federal Reserve.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:03.570
The problem here is when the government borrows
from the Federal Reserve, unlike its borrowing

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:07.620
from any of these other groups, it creates
inflation.

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.180
Inflation is a tax on savings.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:15.050
In effect, as the Federal Government runs
out of places to borrow, it must turn to the

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:17.750
Federal Reserve to borrow money.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:21.910
When it does that, it creates inflation, which
erodes the purchasing power of all of our

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:22.910
savings.

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:26.060
Myth number 10, there's no way to fix this
problem.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.000
It turns out that there is.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.350
We could have a balanced budget within five
years if we followed this recipe.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:35.910
First, cut all spending this year by 10%,
no exceptions.

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.870
If there's some things you don't want to cut
by 10%, then cut something else by more so

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.900
that when you're done, in total, you have
cut by 10%.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:48.140
When I say cut by 10%, I mean the word in
the way any normal human being uses it.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:52.680
When politicians say, "Cut the budget," what
they mean is to increase the budget by less

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.560
than they would actually like.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.580
This is a actual 10% cut.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:00.310
We spend 10% less than we did the year before.

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:04.720
Then hold spending constant for four years,
don't even adjust for inflation.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:09.511
What happens over these four years is as the
government holds its spending constant, the

00:20:09.511 --> 00:20:11.340
economy continues to grow.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:18.710
At the end of the fifth year, the economy
is now large enough that it can support the

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:20.031
government that exists.

00:20:20.031 --> 00:20:23.000
At the end of the fifth year, we'll have our
first balanced budget.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.400
Thereafter, the Federal Government can continue
to increase its spending if it likes, provided

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:32.730
that the increase does not outpace the growth
rate of the economy as a whole.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:36.780
This solution stops the bleeding.

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:42.550
It prevents the debt problem from getting
worse, but it doesn't solve the debt problem.

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:45.850
However, we can grow out of this.

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:52.210
It took perhaps 100 years for our debt problem
to grow to the size it is now.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:58.360
If we can stop the problem from getting worse,
over the course of the next 50 or 100 years,

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:04.800
the economy will grow enough that the current
$150 trillion debt won't matter.
