00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:11.129
On this list, you’ll find some of the most
terrifying gangs and crime syndicates from

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.079
every continent on Earth, with the exception
of Australia and, obviously, Antarctica.

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:15.079
No one’s going to be muscling in on penguin
turf anytime soon.

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:18.530
As for the Land Down Under, it’s because
while Australia has some scary biker gangs,

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.430
which are called bikie gangs (how adorable!),
their most dominant crime syndicate is actually

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.820
centralized in Europe (and it’s found in
entry #5).

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.140
In some cases, these gangs make more money
than Fortune 500 companies, while others generate

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.579
very little revenue, but what they all have
in common is that they are terrifying.

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.249
10.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:42.399
The Numbers Gang

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.039
Pollsmoor Prison is located in Cape Town,
South Africa, and is famous for two reasons.

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.110
The first is that Nelson Mandela was imprisoned
there for six years.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.719
The second is that the prison is basically
run by three different gangs – the 26s,

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.960
the 27s, and 29s, or known as a whole as the
Numbers Gangs.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.960
The gangs have a pretty easy-to-understand
pitch when it comes to recruiting new members

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.320
– join a gang or get raped and possibly
murdered.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.720
Each gang plays a specific role in the overcrowded
prison.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.880
The 26s are physically fit men that are capable
of stealing.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.820
Next is the 27s; they specifically target
guards, which means guards don’t normally

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.550
enter the prison itself.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.670
Instead everything inside the prison is controlled
by the gangs.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.000
In order to join the 27s, you have to stab
a guard first.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.360
Finally, there is the 28s, and they have a
pretty open membership.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.680
When a man joins, there are two roles that
he can fulfill for the gang.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.950
They can be part of the gold line, which is
a fighter, or they can choose the silver line,

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.990
which is to serve the fighters sexually.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.000
If someone chooses the silver line, they are
initiated into the gang by having sex with

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.810
the leader of the 28s, John Mongrel, who came
to Pollsmoor when he was just 14-years-old.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.000
In an interview on the documentary show Ross
Kemp on Gangs, Mongrel was very clear that

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
the sex involves a lot of eye contact, but
he’s not too big on consent.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.920
Luckily, the gang does not have much influence
outside of the prison, but it should be an

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.820
excellent reminder to stay on the right side
of the law if you’re ever in Cape Town.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.820
9.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.820
Sun Yee On

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.819
The triads, which is colloquially known as
the Chinese mafia, dates back to the 17th

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:11.819
century.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.700
They originally formed as a society that wanted
to overthrow the Qing dynasty and restore

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.000
the Ming dynasty.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.680
They ultimately failed, but the bond between
the members survived.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.360
In the 20th century, the large triad group
started to break up into smaller factions.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.630
When the Chinese Communist Party came to power
in 1949, many of the groups moved to Hong

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.209
Kong, while others went to Macau, Taiwan,
and other countries overseas including Canada,

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.780
the United States, the United Kingdom, and
Australia.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.650
Today, it’s believed that there are 57 triad
societies and the biggest of those groups

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.780
is Sun Yee On, which was formed in 1919 and
are Hong Kong-based.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.489
It’s unclear how many members they have,
but it is suspected that they have over 60,000

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:52.500
members worldwide.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.299
In order to join, a person has to take 36
oaths, like “If I am arrested after committing

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.290
an offense, I must accept my punishment and
not try to place blame on my sworn brothers.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.480
If I do so I will be killed by five thunderbolts,”
or “I shall never embezzle cash or property

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.980
from my sworn brothers.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.629
If I break this oath I will be killed by myriads
of swords.”

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.099
Sun Yee On makes money the same way that many
other gangs do; they run prostitution rings,

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.349
fraud schemes, extort legitimate businesses,
and are known to traffic and deal in heroin,

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:22.680
cocaine, and opium.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.239
Supposedly, Sun Yee On made a deal with the
Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico and they now have

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.510
access to the raw materials to make methamphetamine.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.379
Sun Yee On’s main form of attack is assaults
with knives because of Hong Kong’s strict

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:35.610
firearm laws.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.319
What happens many times is that groups of
men armed with knives, often meat cleavers

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.270
which are called “choppers,” swarm their
victims and stab and slash them.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.519
Not all of the attacks are deadly, but they
can leave victims without a limb.

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.519
8.

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:49.519
D-Company

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:55.159
D-Company was started by Dawood Ibrahim in
Bombay (now known as Mumbai), India, in 1976.

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:59.760
Ibrahim was raised Muslim and lived in a predominantly
Muslim area of Bombay.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.739
Despite the fact that his father was a police
constable, Ibrahim and his brother got involved

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.860
in petty crime as teenagers and eventually
developed a gang with their friends.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.680
In the mid-1980s, the gang made a power grab
from the gang that had a monopoly over the

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.640
Bombay underground, the Lala clan, and after
a short war, D-Company came out the victor.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.780
However, Ibrahim was wanted for murder, so
he was forced to leave India and moved to

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.780
Dubai.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.030
Over the next two decades, Ibrahim ran D-Company
and made it one of the biggest crime syndicates

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.270
without ever stepping foot in India.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.410
While in exile, Ibrahim masterminded the 1993
Bombay Bombings, which was a series of 12

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.190
car bombs planted by D-Company, all detonated
on March 12.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.930
257 people were killed and 713 people were
injured.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.130
The apparent motive was revenge for Muslims
being killed in protests in the months preceding

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.130
the bombings.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.789
In 2003, Ibrahim was told to leave Dubai after
one of his associates was assassinated in

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.100
a popular club there.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.259
It’s believed he then moved to Karachi,
Pakistan.

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:57.990
However, the Pakistani government denies any
knowledge of him, although locals can apparently

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.550
point out his house.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.030
D-Company is heavily involved in real estate
scams and extortion in Mumbai and the United

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.270
Arab Emirates.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.470
Other profitable businesses for the gang include
counterfeiting currency, arms running, and

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.710
drug trafficking.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.840
7.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.840
Yamaguchi-gumi

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.260
Japan’s organized crime syndicate, the yakuza,
is comprised of 21 boryokudan (“violence

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.910
groups”) and the biggest one is Yamaguchi-gumi,
which is headed by Kenichi Shinoda, who is

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.570
the gangs sixth ever kumicho (“chairman”).

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:29.020
The group was founded in 1915 by Harukichi
Yamaguchi in Kobe, Japan.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.750
Yamaguchi-gumi is involved in all levels of
illegal activity like running the red light

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.569
districts in Japan, drugs and arms trafficking,
extortion, fraud, and blackmail.

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:40.130
They even fix sumo wrestling matches.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.310
Of course, Yamaguchi-gumi is not above using
violence and they have been involved in several

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.100
gang wars throughout the years.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.090
One between 1985 and 1989 got to be so bad
that a local newspaper kept a running score

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.250
of how many people died and how many were
injured.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.669
Despite being violent gangs, for decades,
Yamaguchi-gumi and the other yakuza families

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.300
worked out in the open in Japan and had a
huge membership.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.169
During the 1990s and 2000s, there were about
80,000 yakuza and about half of them belonged

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.310
to Yamaguchi-gumi, making them the largest
street gang in the world at the time.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.100
However, the overall yakuza numbers have dwindled
since 2011, because that is when laws were

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.380
enacted to restrict the yakuza’s access
to revenue.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.389
Then in 2015, 3,000 Yamaguchi-gumi members
splintered off into a new group.

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:28.460
It was thought this split would lead to a
full out war like the one in the 1980s.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.690
But while there were incidents of violence,
the war has yet to happen.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.370
Currently, Yamaguchi-gumi’s membership is
at about 11,500, but an expert on the yakuza,

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.490
Jake Adelstein, thinks that the number will
grow in 2021 when many casinos will open in

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:43.490
Japan.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.330
Adelstein believes that the yakuza will skim
money from the casino and blackmail people

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.710
who lose big at them.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:49.710
6.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.379
The Albanian Mafia

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:55.690
Not a whole lot is known about the Albanian
mob, and one reason is that Albanians have

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:01.199
a very unique language, so international investigators
have a hard time penetrating their communications.

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:05.289
What is known is that it was started around
the 1950s, when a large group of Albanians

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:06.639
immigrated to Turkey.

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:10.419
This opened up trade routes for heroin from
Turkey into Albania.

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:14.860
In the 1980s, just as communism was about
to fall there, Albanians started to leave

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.569
the country, and some of them ended up in
New York.

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:20.129
Some men found work with the Gambino family
as hitmen.

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:23.639
Before long, they eventually formed their
own gang, Rudaj Organization, and began to

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:25.759
battle the Gambino and Lucchese for territory.

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:30.380
Back in Albania, communism came to an end
in in 1989, and in the chaos, criminal gangs

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.289
expanded and gained a lot of power.

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:37.300
Also, since there were Albanian immigrants
in different pockets of the world, like in

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.460
the United States, the growing mafia had global
connections.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:45.819
Today it’s believed that there are 15 different
crime families operating in Albania.

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:49.710
Their major areas of revenue are trafficking
heroin and human smuggling.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.660
They are considered a hybrid group, as they
not only deal in criminal activities, but

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.919
are heavily involved in political activities
as well.

00:07:56.919 --> 00:07:57.919
5.

00:07:57.919 --> 00:07:58.919
‘Ndrangheta

00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:00.780
Italy is the birthplace of the mafia.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:05.099
The term “mafia” was used to exclusively
describe the crime family that is based in

00:08:05.099 --> 00:08:09.650
Sicily, which was started in the 1860s during
the chaotic, crime-filled time when Sicily

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.300
became a state of the newly formed Italy.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.620
Today, there are four main families in Italy.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:19.379
The original Sicilian mafia, which is now
known as Cosa Nostra, is still active, but

00:08:19.379 --> 00:08:21.180
they aren’t as powerful as they once were.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:26.009
The other families are the Camorra, based
in Campania; the Apulia-based Sacra Corona

00:08:26.009 --> 00:08:30.389
Unita; and finally, the most powerful – ‘Ndrangheta,
which is based in Calabria.

00:08:30.389 --> 00:08:34.420
‘Ndrangheta first formed in the Calabrian
prison system in the late 1800s, but they

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:39.840
started to come into power over a century
and a half later in the 1960s and 1970s, when

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.920
they would kidnap people for ransom.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.260
Using the ransom money, they invested in cocaine
and were the first family to exploit the drug

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.260
market.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.770
Cosa Nostra, who was the dominant gang at
the time, wasn’t as quick to get into the

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:51.770
drug trade.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:55.670
Instead, they were focusing their efforts
on a violent push back against the government,

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.780
who were trying to clamp down on their illegal
activities.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:02.570
A pair of murders that really got the attention
of the police was the killing of two anti-mafia

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:03.570
judges.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.910
With the police more focused on their rival,
it gave ‘Ndrangheta room to flourish.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:10.200
Today, it is thought that ‘Ndrangheta are
responsible for 80 percent of all cocaine

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.310
trafficking in Europe.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:15.170
Besides cocaine, ‘Ndrangheta are also involved
in nearly every other type of illegal activity

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:18.210
that is profitable, with the exception of
prostitution.

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.200
From all their illicit activity, ‘Ndrangheta
supposedly makes too much money and don’t

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.340
know what to do with it.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.040
The police have audio tape of two gangsters
digging up money they had buried in order

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.170
to hide it, and found out millions of dollars
had rotted.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:33.390
As for how much they make, according to an
Italian think-tank, in 2013 they made $60

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:37.660
billion in revenue, which is about as much
as PepsiCo made in 2016 and about three percent

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.310
of Italy’s GDP.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.110
One key to their success is that they are
very secretive.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.770
Many times, the only people who are allowed
into the gang are blood relatives.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:49.210
This makes it hard for members to testify
against another member because they would

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:54.520
be turning against someone who is literally
a brother, a nephew, or a father, and so on.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.210
Their methods appear to be working because
it’s rare for a member of ‘Ndrangheta

00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.940
to cooperate with the police.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.900
One recorded case of a police informant working
against ‘Ndrangheta happened in 2010 and

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:05.920
it didn’t end well.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.030
The 35-year-old woman was shot, and her body
dissolved in acid.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:13.930
So while ‘Ndrangheta may be secretive, they
aren’t afraid to make headlines by using

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:14.930
violence.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:15.930
4.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:17.840
The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:23.690
The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)
was started in 2004 as al-Qaeda in Iraq and

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:27.770
after several leaders were killed, they changed
their name to the Islamic State of Iraq and

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:31.560
Syria (ISIS), and in between were known as
the Islamic State of Iraq.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.920
These days, the names ISIS and ISIL are basically
interchangeable.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.900
Currently, they have strongholds in Iraq and
Syria.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.150
Many of you reading this are probably thinking
that ISIL is a terrorist group, and you are

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.150
totally correct.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:47.120
However, that label does not make them any
less of a criminal organization.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.680
ISIL uses many of same recruiting methods
as many street gangs.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.170
Notably, they attract young, angry men, not
just from the war-torn areas where they live,

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.640
but from across the globe, with the promise
of guns, power, and money.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.730
Their criminal activities include ransom from
kidnappings, selling stolen artifacts, extortion,

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.860
and they’re also big into human trafficking.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.990
One thing that ISIL has that none of the other
gangs do is access to oil.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:14.330
From all their illegal activity, it’s believed
that they make over $1 billion a year.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:18.480
ISIL’s notoriety on a global scale was helped
by their execution videos that they uploaded

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.560
to the internet.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.270
Many times they are beheadings and in some
cases, the executions are performed by children.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.270
3.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.770
Solntsevskaya Bratva

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:30.850
Solntsevskaya Bratva is the Russian Mafia,
but very little is known about them.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:35.220
It’s believed to have been started by Sergei
Mikhailov, who fancies himself more of a businessman

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.220
than a gangster.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.360
The syndicate doesn’t have a rigid central
structure.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.410
Instead, it’s 10 autonomous groups that
work fairly independent of each other.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:47.140
However, there is a 12-person board that meets
regularly and they will pool resources.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.190
They also have chapters on every continent
(except Antarctica).

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:54.130
Solntsevskaya Bratva is believed to be one
of the wealthiest and most profitable crime

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.330
syndicates in the world.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:59.320
They are involved in every single aspect of
the Russian criminal underworld and one of

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.660
their biggest revenue streams is extortion.

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.680
Supposedly, people doing business in Russia
end up paying out about 20% of their profits

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.800
to Solntsevskaya Bratva.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.250
If they don’t pay up, their family members
will most likely end up dead.

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:12.880
And if Solntsevskaya Bratva doesn’t have
a problem going after people’s families

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.600
over extortion money, one can only imagine
what they do to rivals and people who wronged

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.600
them.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.600
2.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.600
Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13)

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.720
The United States has more than its share
of violent gangs and crime syndicates.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.780
There are motorcycle gangs like the Hell’s
Angels and the Mongols, or urban gangs like

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.980
the Bloods and the Crips, but for the FBI,
the most troublesome is Mara Salvatrucha,

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.010
better known as MS-13.

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:37.860
Currently, they are the only gang that has
a dedicated task force assigned to them.

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:42.700
MS-13 was started in the 1980s in Los Angeles
by immigrants from El Salvador who were fleeing

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.010
from a civil war.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:49.380
Since then, MS-13 have grown to become a “transnational
criminal organization,” and they have 6,000

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:54.670
to 10,000 members spread across 42 states
and D.C., along with international chapters,

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:59.110
which are called cliques, in Canada, Mexico,
El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:03.140
Gang members are often recognizable because
of their tattoos, which are sometimes on their

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:06.650
face, and their clothing is often adorned
with MS-13 symbols.

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:11.420
Ethnically, they are mainly Salvadorian or
first generation American-Salvadorians, but

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.730
there are also some members that are Honduran
and Guatemalan as well.

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:18.100
They often recruit young men, often trying
to get boys who are in middle and high school.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.960
Their main sources of income are dealing drugs,
extortion, robbery, and human trafficking,

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.580
often for the sex trade.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:28.350
One reason that MS-13 worries the FBI so much
is their shocking level of violence.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:33.610
Often, much of the violence stems from the
fact that MS-13 doesn’t exactly have a hierarchy;

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:37.060
instead they have more of a horizontal system,
with cliques acting autonomously.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:41.480
This causes tension between the cliques and
it often leads to violent conflicts and civilians

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.020
can be caught in the crossfire.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:47.230
Also, while they are violent in the United
States, they are even worse in Central America.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:51.970
Their territory in Honduras, El Salvador,
and Guatemala is called the Northern Triangle

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:56.050
and it is the most violent part of the world
that is not at war.

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:57.050
1.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:58.050
Los Zetas

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:02.040
The current major Mexican drug cartels started
off as drug traffickers who shipped cocaine

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.210
from Colombia into the United States in the
1980s.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:08.430
During that time, the United States government
was cracking down on the Colombian cartels,

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.890
but not much was being done in Mexico.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:15.840
During the ’80s, the two most dominant Mexican
cartels were the Guadalajara cartel and the

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.840
Gulf cartel.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.450
In 1989, the head of the Guadalajara cartel
was arrested and the cartel’s trafficking

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:26.361
routes were split up between the three lieutenants,
giving birth to the Sinaloa, Juárez, and

00:14:26.361 --> 00:14:27.720
Tijuana cartels.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:32.040
Currently, the Sinaloa cartel is considered
the most dominant cartel because they have

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:36.260
the biggest territory and the most trafficking
routes, which are supposedly approved by the

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.260
FBI, into the United States.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:41.040
This includes a drug route into Chicago, which,
perhaps not so coincidentally, has seen a

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.910
dramatic rise in murder.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:46.140
Meanwhile, the Gulf cartel is considered the
second largest.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:51.830
However, the most terrifying cartel is the
third largest – Los Zetas, which means the

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.830
“The Zs.”

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:56.450
The identity of their current leader is unknown
and there could be a good reason for that.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:15:00.500
Since its inception, all their known leaders
have either been arrested or killed.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:05.510
Their last leader was Omar Treviño Morales,
who was arrested in 2015, and the leader before

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:10.590
him was his brother Miguel Treviño Morales,
and he was arrested in 2013.

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:15.970
Los Zetas started off as a 34-man death squad
for the Gulf cartel in 1999.

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:19.390
They were all former Mexican military and
had received elite training.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:22.610
By 2003, their numbers grew to over 300 men.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.000
After years of infighting, Los Zetas officially
broke away from the Gulf cartel in 2010.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.020
At the time of the split, the US government
said that Los Zetas was “the most technologically

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.870
advanced, sophisticated and dangerous cartel
operating in Mexico.”

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:40.190
What makes Los Zetas so dangerous is that
they don’t really play by any rules.

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:44.520
For example, in 2009, they broke into the
home of a police chief, shot him and his wife,

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.060
who was also a police officer, and then set
the house on fire with the couple’s three

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.640
daughters still alive inside.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:55.160
Another time, in spring 2011, Los Zetas stopped
several buses full of migrants.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.910
They raped the women and then forced the men
to fight gladiator-style to the death.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:02.610
The winners were then given jobs as assassins
with Los Zetas for their ongoing war with

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:04.810
the Gulf and Sinaloa cartels.

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:06.690
Everyone else on the buses were murdered.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:11.420
After the bus hijacking, 193 bodies were found
buried in 72 graves.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:12.627
This was just one of several massacres they
committed where dozens of people were senselessly

00:16:12.627 --> 00:16:13.627
slaughtered.

00:16:13.627 --> 00:16:14.627
Not even people on social media can speak
out against Los Zetas.

00:16:14.627 --> 00:16:15.627
One citizen journalist, Maria del Rosario
Fuentes Rubio, posted stories and spoke out

00:16:15.627 --> 00:16:16.627
against Los Zetas anonymously online for several
months using the hashtag #reynosafollow.

00:16:16.627 --> 00:16:17.627
In 2014, a tweet was sent out from her account
that read, “#reynosafollow FRIENDS AND FAMILY,

00:16:17.627 --> 00:16:18.627
MY REAL NAME IS MARÍA DEL ROSARIO FUENTES
RUBIO.

00:16:18.627 --> 00:16:19.627
I AM A PHYSICIAN.

00:16:19.627 --> 00:16:20.627
TODAY MY LIFE HAS COME TO AN END.”

00:16:20.627 --> 00:16:21.627
That was followed by a tweet that contained
two pictures, one of a woman, presumed to

00:16:21.627 --> 00:16:22.627
be del Rosario Fuentes Rubio, looking at the
camera, and the next one was the same woman

00:16:22.627 --> 00:16:23.627
with a gunshot wound to her head.

00:16:23.627 --> 00:16:24.627
Sadly, the body of Maria del Rosario Fuentes
Rubio has never been found.

00:16:24.627 --> 00:16:25.627
Los Zetas have also taken a page out of ISIL’s
playbook and make videos of decapitations.

00:16:25.627 --> 00:16:26.627
The videos then somehow make their way online
and, based on a quick Google search, which

00:16:26.627 --> 00:16:27.627
we highly, highly advise against, there are
a variety of Los Zetas beheading videos.

00:16:27.627 --> 00:16:28.627
Finally, a former leader of Los Zetas liked
to kill his victims by a technique called

00:16:28.627 --> 00:16:29.627
guiso, which means stew.

00:16:29.627 --> 00:16:32.810
He would stuff someone in a 55 gallon drum
and then burn them alive.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:39.460
Those are just a few crimes committed by Los
Zetas, but they are responsible for many,

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:43.220
many other horrifying atrocities and are probably
the most terrifying gang in operation right

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.450
now.
