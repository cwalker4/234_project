00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.850
Assassination is so ingrained in American
culture that it’s practically a national

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:12.850
pastime.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.410
Every single president since Lyndon Johnson
has been the target of an assassination attempt;

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.140
with plenty more before LBJ also finding themselves
on the wrong end of a bullet.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.750
That’s before you take into account the
lower-ranking politicians attacked, the civil

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.820
rights figures, the sportsmen, the artists…

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.620
All we’re saying is that, if assassination
was an Olympic sport, team USA would be beating

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.780
everyone but Russia.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.390
The one upside is that American assassinations
usually end with the assassin themselves dying.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.440
Think of Lee Harvey Oswald, gunned down by
Jack Ruby.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.610
Or John Wilkes Booth, shot to pieces by Federal
troops.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.100
But “usually” isn’t the same as always.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.880
Just occasionally, an American assassination
ends with the attempted killer surviving.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.880
And surviving.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.880
And surviving.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.239
The following 10 have survived for so long
now that you’ll probably be surprised to

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.650
learn they’re not dead from old age.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.950
10.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.160
Sirhan Sirhan

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.820
The 1960s were a terrible decade to have the
surname Kennedy.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.190
After JFK was gunned down in Dallas in 1963,
Democrat hopes were pinned on his brother

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.190
Bobby.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.000
Fast forward five years from John’s death,
and Bobby Kennedy was also gunned down, only

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.929
moments after becoming the Democrat party’s
pick to run for president.

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:30.039
His assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, was a Palestinian
native born in Jerusalem.

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.840
As the life bled out of yet another Kennedy,
he was heard to shout “I did it for my country!”

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.990
Sirhan’s guilt was pretty well established.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.789
Even the conspiracy theorists think he fired
at RFK (they disagree on whether there was

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:42.899
a second shooter).

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.459
Although Sirhan later claimed he couldn’t
remember a thing of the killing, prosecutors

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:48.930
treated it as an open and shut case.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.239
On April 23, 1969, the Palestinian assassin
was given the death penalty.

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:56.170
So what’s he doing on our list?

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.039
For that, you can thank the state of California.

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.149
California outlawed the death penalty in 1972,
before Shiran got his chance to dance the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.149
hangman’s jig.

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.399
When it was reinstated a year later, all those
who had previously been sentenced to death

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.420
– including Shiran and one Charles Manson
–were now on life imprisonment.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.849
Nearly 50 years after he was incarcerated,
Shiran is still hoping to be released.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:17.849
9.

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:18.879
John Hinckley, Jr.

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.310
On March 31, 1981, President Ronald Reagan
stepped out the Hilton Hotel in Washington,

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.120
DC, and into a hail of bullets.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.540
In a matter of seconds, John Hinckley Jr.
squeezed off six shots, wounding two officers

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.290
and putting a bullet through the Press Secretary’s
brain.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.440
The President himself was badly wounded; a
slightly different angle and Reagan would

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.760
now be known as the fifth White House incumbent
to be gunned down.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.760
So what happened to the man who nearly killed
four people?

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.319
Where is Hinckley now?

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.180
Err… at home, in Virginia, living with his
mother.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.870
After the shooting, Hinckley was found not-guilty
by reason of insanity and committed to an

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.870
asylum.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.939
This angered a lot of people, both because
Hinckley had just committed what is usually

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.939
a serious crime, and because he was a spoiled
rich kid who had never yet had to deal with

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:05.950
the consequences of his actions.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.830
Things didn’t improve much in hospital.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.510
Hinckley was discovered exchanging letters
with Ted Bundy and trying to contact Charles

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.510
Manson.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.620
Hinckley was eventually released in 2016.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.120
At time of writing, he was still confined
to a fifty mile radius around his mother’s

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.880
home and was receiving psychiatric treatment.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.880
8.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.880
Squeaky Fromme

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.370
If the name “Squeaky” Fromme sounds like
a kids’ cartoon character, the actual personality

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.469
of its owner couldn’t be any different.

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:34.159
Born Lynette, Squeaky was a member of the
Manson Family.

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:38.090
Although she wasn’t involved in the killing
of Sharon Tate, the young dancer was obsessed

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.420
by the cult leader.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.659
When Manson was moved between jails after
his conviction, she moved town to follow him.

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.670
She had other, equally shady connections.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.530
Not long after Manson was imprisoned, Squeaky
was arrested for the brutal murder of a couple.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.709
Again, she avoided jail while, again, her
associates – this time members of the Aryan

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.140
Brotherhood – were imprisoned for the crimes.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.900
But even her connections with California’s
weirdest cult and a buncha neo-Nazis has nothing

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.959
on the time she tried to kill a US President.

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.170
The year was 1975.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.909
It was a warm fall day in Sacramento.

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.349
As Gerald Ford passed through a crowd, Squeaky
suddenly emerged from between two people,

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.389
pulled out a loaded gun and pointed it right
at the president’s chest.

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:17.389
The gun jammed.

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.840
“It didn’t go off!” was Squeaky’s
defense when arrested, and it sure as heck

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.970
didn’t fly.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.289
She was jailed for attempted assassination
and only released in 2009.

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.220
She currently resides in NYC.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.770
Interestingly, she wasn’t the only young
woman to try and kill Ford…

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:34.770
7.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.990
Sara Jane Moore

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.630
Sara Jane Moore looks like the world’s least
offensive grandma.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.630
Here, follow this link and watch her talking
to CNN.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.630
Ain’t she just adorable?

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.630
Can’t you just imagine her baking you cookies
when you were ten, raising money to fund her

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.630
church’s new roof, and spending her weekends
tending to her lawn?

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.349
Well, never has the truism “don’t judge
a book by its cover” ever been truer.

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:49.580
Only 17 days after Squeaky’s lame attempt
to off Ford, Sara Jane Moore smilingly raised

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.180
a gun in San Francisco and fired at the President’s
head.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.270
Her lone bullet missed his skull by inches.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.259
Perhaps weirdest of all about Moore is how
boring her life was before that moment.

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:04.380
While Squeaky was the kind of girl whose life
choices were always gonna boil down to assassinate

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.990
a president or drink the Kool-Aid, Moore was
unbelievably average.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.120
She’d been married.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.449
She worked as a bookkeeper.

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:11.680
She enjoyed amateur acting.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.120
In her CNN interview, she says the only trouble
she’d previously had with the law was for

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.120
jaywalking.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.680
The only sign she was an up-and-coming fruitcake
was her association with the Symbionese Liberation

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.630
Army, the leftwing radical cell that kidnapped
Patty Hearst.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.770
Even crazier than Moore’s boring life?

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.300
She’s now something of a minor celebrity,
appearing on news programs to discuss the

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.710
time she almost killed a president.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.710
6.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.710
Thomas Hagan

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.160
You don’t know the name Thomas Hagan, but
you’ve certainly heard of his victim.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.650
Hagan was the guy who killed Malcolm X, shooting
the civil rights leader dead while he addressed

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.840
the Organization of Afro-American Unity in
1965.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.130
At least, he was the only guy who admitted
to the killing.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.419
Up to three others were involved, possibly
with the backing of Malcolm X’s old organization

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.300
Nation of Islam, who he’d recently fallen
out with.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.000
Interestingly, while two others went to jail
alongside Hagan, no one seems to know for

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.639
sure if they were even at the scene of the
crime.

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.860
For Hagan’s part, he has repeatedly said
he wishes he hadn’t shot X, once stating:

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.879
“I don’t think it should ever have happened.”

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:13.080
At the time he clearly felt differently.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.770
Hagan justified the shooting by saying Malcolm
X had slandered Nation of Islam’s leader,

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.250
and that his leaving had threatened to destroy
the organization.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.440
The crowd who watched him shoot X evidently
didn’t care.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.509
They beat Hagan half to death before police
intervened.

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:31.569
Today, Hagan is a family man with a full time
job, living outside prison on parole.

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:36.419
Prior to that, he was on release Monday to
Friday, only serving weekends in jail.

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:37.419
5.

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:38.419
Arthur Bremer

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:42.979
You probably know George Wallace for his “segregation
now, segregation forever” speech.

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:45.770
But the Alabama governor was nearly so much
more.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:50.770
In 1972, he was favorite to win Maryland in
the Democratic primaries to run for president.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.310
He’d already won Michigan, stretching his
support outside the Deep South.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.860
He might have even become the first Democratic
nominee from the party’s Dixiecrat wing.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.949
“Might” being the operative word, there.

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:04.770
We’ll never know, because on the day before
the Maryland primary, Arthur Bremer stepped

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.770
out a crowd and shot Wallace in the abdomen.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:07.770
Strikingly, Bremer didn’t try to kill Wallace
for some grand civil rights cause.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.390
He shot the governor because his plan to kill
Nixon had fallen through when he saw how well-guarded

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.520
the president was, and decided to set his
sights a little lower.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.480
In videos of the event, he can be seen in
the crowd with an eerie grin on his face,

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.280
his eyes obscured by sunglasses, looking for
all the world like Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.150
Wallace survived the assassination attempt,
which left him paralyzed from the waist down.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:28.780
Bremer was jailed, despite claiming to be
schizophrenic, and kept inside for 35 years.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.720
Released in 2007, he is now said to have a
steady job.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.389
Conditions of his parole, however, mean he
still can’t go anywhere near elected officials.

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:37.389
4.

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:39.129
Francisco Martin Duran

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:43.840
Francisco Martin Duran’s attempt to kill
Bill Clinton has to be one of the most ham-fisted

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.199
assassinations in history.

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:50.710
Duran hid an assault rifle in his trench coat,
took it up to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.360
waited till he saw the President emerge from
the White House.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.180
He immediately began firing across the lawn,
cracking a window and… ummm, that’s it.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.419
Duran’s firing was super-erratic, and lasted
only a couple of seconds before bystanders

00:08:02.419 --> 00:08:04.099
managed to wrestle him to the ground.

00:08:04.099 --> 00:08:07.319
It later emerged that the man Duran thought
was Clinton hadn’t been the President at

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:09.430
all, who was inside watching TV.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.870
Not a single person was hurt during the attempt.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:16.379
Duran later tried to claim he’d been fighting
aliens, briefly turning his bungled assassination

00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:19.550
attempt into a nationwide source of amusement.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:24.479
As excuses went, it was even weaker than Squeaky’s
insistence that failing to accurately load

00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:27.460
a gun means you can’t have been trying to
kill someone.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.979
Duran was convicted in 1995 after 60 witnesses
were found who agreed he might not have mentioned

00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:35.360
aliens before, but sure as heck had mentioned
killing Clinton.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.360
3.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.360
Kenneth McGriff

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.010
McGriff is the odd one out on this list, as
he’s the only person we don’t know for

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.000
absolute sure killed their target.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.380
A drug trafficker and gang member, McGriff
was the kingpin of New York’s Supreme Team

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.140
– a fancy name for a gang of hoodlums who
killed people over crack debts.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:55.190
He’s currently in prison for hiring people
to kill his enemies, but law enforcement thinks

00:08:55.190 --> 00:09:00.500
he was also behind one of the most-notorious
music assassinations of the 21st Century:

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.580
the killing of Run DMC member Jam Master Jay.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:08.600
Jay was killed in 2002 in Queens, NYC, while
sat inside a recording studio.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.010
Two gunmen entered and shot him through the
head.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.530
The murder remains officially unsolved, but
McGriff is suspected of it.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:19.090
He’s also suspected of a possibly-related
plot to kill 50 Cent, who Jay had mentored

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:23.250
in the late 1990s, before the younger rapper
was rediscovered by Eminem.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:28.660
In 2005, federal agents even released an affidavit
they’d written in 2003, fingering McGriff

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.150
for the two assassination attempts.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:34.541
In short, McGriff is one bad dude, and quite
likely the shooter behind one of the most

00:09:34.541 --> 00:09:37.720
notorious hip hop killings not featuring Biggie
or Tupac.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.850
However, as we say, this has never been definitively
proven.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:42.850
2.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:43.850
Claudine Longet

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.680
Winter sports fans of a certain age will remember
Spider Sibach.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.900
A skier from California, he competed in the
1968 Winter Olympics for team USA, before

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.960
going on to smash the cup circuit.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.450
But most of you are gonna remember him from
how he died.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:00.440
In 1976, Spider was shot dead at his home
in Aspen, Colorado.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.450
To this day, no-one knows if it was an accident…
or a deliberate assassination.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:08.070
What everyone agrees on was that Claudine
Longet was the one who shot him.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:12.920
A singer and actor once married to Andy Williams,
Longet had interesting pedigree where shootings

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.940
were concerned.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.530
She was close friends with Bobby Kennedy,
and was there the night Sirhan Sirhan gunned

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.530
the poor guy down.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:20.600
At first, things seemed almost as clear cut
with her own killing.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.260
She was found standing over Sibach’s body
with the murder weapon in her hands.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.450
Incredibly, she tried to claim she’d been
showing her victim the gun when it “accidentally”

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:29.450
went off.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:30.880
The case was a media sensation.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.220
It soon came to revolve around whether Longet
had been seeing Sibach at the time, or whether

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.750
they’d broken up after a brief fling and
she’d returned to kill him.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.700
Thanks to police bungling the evidence, the
judge had to go with the latter, and Longet

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.260
was never convicted of murder.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:49.010
She still lives in the Aspen area, a twisted
little detail we really don’t want to think

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:50.210
too much about.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.210
1.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.210
Mark David Chapman

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:56.750
After two entries clouded with uncertainty,
it’s grimly reassuring to report there are

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.000
no such ambiguities with our last killer.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.910
Mark David Chapman is the guy who shot John
Lennon dead for being famous.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.980
Not for being a symbol of some ideas Chapman
disagreed with.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:08.360
Lennon was simply the most famous man Chapman
could think of.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:13.390
And so this overweight loser decided to kill
him to make himself equally famous.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:14.390
The worst part?

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:15.430
It kinda worked.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:19.420
On December 8, 1980, Chapman walked up to
Lennon’s Manhattan building.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:23.120
He saw the singer leaving and got him to autograph
a copy of his latest album.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.590
As a result, we still have a photo of John
Lennon and Mark Chapman standing together

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.710
like a pair of friendly acquaintances.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.480
After Lennon left, Chapman then hung around
for a few more hours, before finally shooting

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.800
the ex-Beatle as he returned to the building
just before midnight.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.280
Famously, Chapman didn’t flee, instead standing
around reading The Catcher in the Rye.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.130
Today, the portly assassin is in his sixties
and still resides in jail.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:49.940
It’s gotten to the point where denying Chapman
parole has almost become a sport, with regularly

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.480
played fixtures and an easy to guess outcome.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:12:33.089
It seems unlikely he will ever be released.
