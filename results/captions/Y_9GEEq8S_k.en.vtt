WHERE THERE WILL BE NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THAT.

00:05:54.724 --> 00:05:55.949 line:92%
ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THAT. TRUMP WILL NEVER ACKNOWLEDGE THE

00:05:55.992 --> 00:05:56.883 line:92%
TRUMP WILL NEVER ACKNOWLEDGE THE REAL NUMBERS.

00:05:56.926 --> 00:05:58.251 line:92%

NO REPUBLICAN CARES ABOUT THE DEFICIT ANYMORE.

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:08.161 line:92%
DEFICIT ANYMORE. AND EVEN NOW, THE HOUSE

00:06:08.171 --> 00:06:09.996 line:92%
AND EVEN NOW, THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE SAID THAT COME

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.865 line:92%
REPUBLICANS HAVE SAID THAT COME THE FALL, THEY ARE GOING TO PASS

00:06:11.875 --> 00:06:14.868 line:92%
THE FALL, THEY ARE GOING TO PASS OR TRY TO PASS ANOTHER TAX BILL

00:06:14.911 --> 00:06:16.603 line:92%
OR TRY TO PASS ANOTHER TAX BILL THAT WOULD MAKE PERMANENT SOME

00:06:16.646 --> 00:06:19.272 line:92%
THAT WOULD MAKE PERMANENT SOME OF THE TAX CUTS IN THE PREVIOUS

00:06:19.315 --> 00:06:22.809 line:92%
OF THE TAX CUTS IN THE PREVIOUS TAX BILL, AND THAT WOULD EVEN

00:06:22.852 --> 00:06:24.277 line:92%
TAX BILL, AND THAT WOULD EVEN EXPLODE THE DEFICIT AND THE DEBT

00:06:24.287 --> 00:06:24.978 line:92%
EXPLODE THE DEFICIT AND THE DEBT MUCH MORE THAN IN THE NUMBERS

00:06:24.988 --> 00:06:27.047 line:92%
MUCH MORE THAN IN THE NUMBERS THAT CAME OUT TODAY.

00:06:27.057 --> 00:06:30.183 line:92%
THAT CAME OUT TODAY. SO THEY ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING

00:06:30.227 --> 00:06:32.285 line:92%
SO THEY ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING EXCEPT COMPLAINING ABOUT

00:06:32.295 --> 00:06:33.419 line:92%
EXCEPT COMPLAINING ABOUT SPENDING, BECAUSE THAT’S THE

00:06:33.463 --> 00:06:34.054 line:92%
SPENDING, BECAUSE THAT’S THE WHOLE GOAL HERE.

00:06:34.064 --> 00:06:36.089 line:92%
WHOLE GOAL HERE. THEY’RE GOING TO USE THIS DEBT

00:06:36.133 --> 00:06:37.958 line:92%
THEY’RE GOING TO USE THIS DEBT TO SAY, WELL, WE CAN’T SPEND

00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:39.493 line:92%
TO SAY, WELL, WE CAN’T SPEND MONEY ON THE FOOD STAMPS THAT

MONEY ON THE FOOD STAMPS THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED.

00:06:40.637 --> 00:06:42.262 line:92%
YOU JUST MENTIONED. WE’RE GOING HAVE TO SQUEEZE

00:06:42.305 --> 00:06:42.996 line:92%
WE’RE GOING HAVE TO SQUEEZE MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY

00:06:43.006 --> 00:06:44.164 line:92%
MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY BECAUSE WE’RE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:06:44.174 --> 00:06:45.966 line:92%
BECAUSE WE’RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE PAYING FOR SERVICING THE

00:06:45.976 --> 00:06:46.266 line:92%
BE PAYING FOR SERVICING THE DEBT.

00:06:46.276 --> 00:06:50.103 line:92%

HAD CREDIT CARD DEBT, THIS BEHAVES LIKE CREDIT CARD DEBT.

00:06:52.816 --> 00:06:55.108 line:92%
BEHAVES LIKE CREDIT CARD DEBT. IT’S THE MOST EXPENSIVE KIND OF

00:06:55.118 --> 00:06:55.909 line:92%
IT’S THE MOST EXPENSIVE KIND OF DEBT YOU CAN ENCOUNTER.

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:57.110 line:92%
DEBT YOU CAN ENCOUNTER. AS THIS DEBT GOES UP, THE

00:06:57.154 --> 00:06:59.112 line:92%

00:06:59.122 --> 00:06:59.546 line:92%
INTEREST ON THE DEBT GOES UP DRAMATICALLY.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.281 line:92%
DRAMATICALLY. AND, RON, THAT INTEREST ON THE

00:07:01.292 --> 00:07:03.917 line:92%
AND, RON, THAT INTEREST ON THE DEBT EATS UP IN THE BUDGET EVERY

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:04.217 line:92%
DEBT EATS UP IN THE BUDGET EVERY YEAR.

00:07:04.228 --> 00:07:05.953 line:92%
YEAR. NO ONE MENTIONS IT, BUT IT IS

00:07:05.996 --> 00:07:07.921 line:92%
NO ONE MENTIONS IT, BUT IT IS ONE OF THE LARGEST PIECE OF THE

BUDGET, GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER EVERY YEAR.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.026 line:92%
BIGGER EVERY YEAR. AND IT’S ON TRACK TO BECOME THE

00:07:13.036 --> 00:07:16.329 line:92%
AND IT’S ON TRACK TO BECOME THE LARGEST SPENDING ITEM IN THE

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.632 line:92%
LARGEST SPENDING ITEM IN THE BUDGET, DWARFING ALL OF THE

DISCRETIONARY SPENDING IN THE BUDGET.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.702 line:92%
BUDGET. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS IT WIPES

00:07:21.712 --> 00:07:23.404 line:92%
AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS IT WIPES OUT THAT SPENDING ON EDUCATION,

00:07:23.414 --> 00:07:25.839 line:92%

ZERO SPENDING MODES JUST IN ORDER TO PAY YOUR DEBT.

00:07:31.722 --> 00:07:32.346 line:92%
ORDER TO PAY YOUR DEBT. &gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:34.582 line:92%
&gt;&gt; YEAH. IT SEEMS LIKE TRUMP IS RUNNING A

00:07:34.625 --> 00:07:36.350 line:92%
IT SEEMS LIKE TRUMP IS RUNNING A CONTEST BETWEEN TRYING TO RUN UP

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.551 line:92%
CONTEST BETWEEN TRYING TO RUN UP THE PENTAGON BUDGET AND RUN UP

00:07:37.561 --> 00:07:39.253 line:92%
THE PENTAGON BUDGET AND RUN UP THE DEBT TO SEE WHICH NUMBER CAN

00:07:39.263 --> 00:07:42.923 line:92%
THE DEBT TO SEE WHICH NUMBER CAN BE LARGER IN OUR BUDGET.

00:07:42.933 --> 00:07:44.458 line:92%
BE LARGER IN OUR BUDGET. INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THE DEBT OR

00:07:44.501 --> 00:07:45.192 line:92%
INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THE DEBT OR INCREASINGLY LARGE PAYMENTS TO

INCREASINGLY LARGE PAYMENTS TO THE PENTAGON.

00:07:47.438 --> 00:07:49.263 line:92%
THE PENTAGON. BUT LOOK, LAWRENCE, I THINK THE

00:07:49.273 --> 00:07:50.631 line:92%
BUT LOOK, LAWRENCE, I THINK THE SCARIEST THING OF ALL IS WE’RE

00:07:50.641 --> 00:07:52.733 line:92%
SCARIEST THING OF ALL IS WE’RE SEEING THESE KINDS OF NUMBERS AT

00:07:52.743 --> 00:07:55.236 line:92%
SEEING THESE KINDS OF NUMBERS AT A TIME OF RELATIVE PROSPERITY.

00:07:55.246 --> 00:07:56.670 line:92%
A TIME OF RELATIVE PROSPERITY. SOONER OR LATER, THE BUSINESS

00:07:56.681 --> 00:07:57.771 line:92%
SOONER OR LATER, THE BUSINESS CYCLE WILL TURN.

00:07:57.782 --> 00:07:59.373 line:92%
CYCLE WILL TURN. AND IF TRUMP KEEPS PRESSING

00:07:59.384 --> 00:08:00.975 line:92%
AND IF TRUMP KEEPS PRESSING THESE TARIFFS, IT WILL TURN

00:08:00.985 --> 00:08:01.942 line:92%
THESE TARIFFS, IT WILL TURN SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

00:08:01.953 --> 00:08:03.477 line:92%
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. AND THAT MEANS THAT THE DEFICIT

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.545 line:92%
AND THAT MEANS THAT THE DEFICIT WILL JUST EXPLODE EVEN MORE.

00:08:04.588 --> 00:08:06.180 line:92%
WILL JUST EXPLODE EVEN MORE. WE’LL SEE THE TRUMP RECESSION.

00:08:06.223 --> 00:08:07.048 line:92%
WE’LL SEE THE TRUMP RECESSION. IT WILL COME.

00:08:07.091 --> 00:08:08.482 line:92%
IT WILL COME. AND THEN THESE NUMBERS WILL LOOK

00:08:08.492 --> 00:08:09.883 line:92%
AND THEN THESE NUMBERS WILL LOOK WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE.

00:08:09.894 --> 00:08:11.385 line:92%
WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE. AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE OUT

00:08:11.429 --> 00:08:13.387 line:92%
AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE OUT OF DRY FISCAL POWDER TO TRY TO

00:08:13.397 --> 00:08:14.421 line:92%

00:08:14.465 --> 00:08:15.590 line:92%
STIMULATE THE ECONOMY OR DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

00:08:15.633 --> 00:08:16.558 line:92%
SOMETHING ABOUT IT. TONIGHT’S NEWS IS BAD.

00:08:16.601 --> 00:08:17.959 line:92%
TONIGHT’S NEWS IS BAD. BUT THE FUTURE NEWS IS EVEN

00:08:17.969 --> 00:08:18.259 line:92%
BUT THE FUTURE NEWS IS EVEN WORSE.

00:08:18.269 --> 00:08:20.461 line:92%
WORSE. &gt;&gt; IT’S A VERY DIFFICULT SUBJECT

00:08:20.471 --> 00:08:22.797 line:92%
&gt;&gt; IT’S A VERY DIFFICULT SUBJECT TO RUN CAMPAIGNS ON BECAUSE THE
