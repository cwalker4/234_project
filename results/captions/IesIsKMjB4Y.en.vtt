00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.620
- [Cory] It may not look like it,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.130
but I'm creating one of the strongest

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.483
and most versatile materials
on Earth, graphene.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.550
You've probably heard buzz about it.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.913
Graphene made big waves back in 2004,

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.280
and it's knocked around
science news ever since.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.450
- A global race for graphene.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.680
- You know, it's not just
limited to one little thing.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.160
- One of the greatest
discoveries of the 21st century.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.482
- [Man] Graphene could be the key

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:26.282
to a lot of mind blowing technology.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.040
- But that was almost 15 years ago.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.380
Where are all of the graphene
wonders that we were promised?

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.710
The bulletproof armor,
the graphene circuitry,

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.370
the ultra light airplanes,
the graphene medicine,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.253
a space elevator?

00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:39.310
- [Female Voiceover] So the
next time man walks on the moon,

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.690
maybe he'll take the
elevator to get there.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.163
- Clearly, a lot of the
buzz never went anywhere.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.080
But graphene does exist.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.360
Engineers have gone to
making one fleck at a time,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.070
to producing it by the barrelful.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.090
- Do you want to try to pick it up?

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.923
- Sure.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.490
- [Cory] So the graphene
revolution we were promised

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.073
may already be in motion.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.053
- You can stretch and pull on it,

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.913
and in fact, a good way to visualize it,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.440
is that if you had a big
enough sheet of pure graphene,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.813
you could hold up a soccer
ball on just one atomic layer,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.803
and that's insane.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.950
- [Cory] Joseph Meany is
an analytical chemist,

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.420
who coauthored a book about
the promise of graphene.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.530
He explained to us that
graphene is just carbon,

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.653
like coal, or graphite, or diamond.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.390
The difference is in how the carbon atoms

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.530
are bonded together,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.793
and in the unique shape
the material takes.

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:32.160
- [Joseph] So it's just
a single atom sheet,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.800
there's no z dimension
to speak of in graphene.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.420
And these atoms of carbon
are arranged in interlocking

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.383
or tessellated hexagons,
kind of like a chicken wire.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.380
The bonds between the carbon atoms

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.493
are actually extremely strong.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.630
- Back in 2004, researchers
in the UK discovered

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.810
that they could produce graphene

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.693
with some shockingly simple tools.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.880
A hunk of a particular type if graphite,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.330
and some standard issue tape.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.320
- [Joseph] Yeah, it was
just a very large hunk

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.320
that you could hold in your
hand, and they took the tape

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.703
and put it down onto the
surface of the graphite,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.763
and just lifted it off.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.910
- From there, they used chemicals
to dissolve away the tape,

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.850
and they were left with
tiny flakes of graphene

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.423
with remarkable properties.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.923
It's impossibly light,
yet incredibly strong.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.680
It's flexible, and it's a
highly efficient conductor

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.563
of electricity.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.570
The researchers won a Nobel Prize in 2010,

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.500
and today in 2018, literally
everything around us

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.250
is built or enhanced with graphene.

00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:35.753
Okay, not quite.

00:02:38.483 --> 00:02:40.090
- [Phillip] Yeah, I think
it's very easy for the media

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.590
and for the press to seize on any new

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.623
scientific or technological development

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.353
as something that's
going to be be transformative,

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.760
you know, scientists come with
these amazing new materials

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.930
and then everything changes,

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.280
and of course it never
really happens that way.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.570
- [Cory] Phillip Ball is a
reporter who's written a bunch

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.170
about the graphene hype machine.

00:03:00.525 --> 00:03:02.853
And I asked him to throw
some cold water on the story.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.713
- [Phillip] Hello?

00:03:05.713 --> 00:03:06.700
- Hi, is this Phillip Ball?

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.850
- [Phillip] It is, yes.

00:03:08.286 --> 00:03:09.289
- Hi, how are you doing?

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:10.122
This is Cory calling from the Verge,

00:03:10.122 --> 00:03:10.955
- [Phillip] Hi, hello, Cory.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.390
Of course with any new technology,

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.780
the reality is it generally
takes years to develop it.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.960
It would be unreasonable
to expect graphene

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.133
to transform our lives overnight.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.580
- The uphill battle for any new material

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.810
is that it can't just be better
than existing technology,

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.093
it has to be much better.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.040
Phillip says that's
the issue with graphene

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.043
replacing silicon in electronics.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.180
- [Phillip] Certainly there are companies

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.649
who are exploring its use

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:40.173
as a conductive electronic material.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.729
But of course we already
have such materials,

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:46.440
and graphene has really
got to have big advantages

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.960
over what we have already
if it's going to displace

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.023
what is already well
established, mature, technology.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.410
- But that's not to say that
graphene hasn't gone anywhere

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.583
in 15 years.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.950
We found some engineers
who are making materials

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.270
with graphene today,
materials that could one day

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.803
even end up in space ships.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.600
The company is Vorbeck Materials,

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.250
and their president, John Lettow,

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.250
showed me how far they've come
with graphene mass production

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.883
and he gave us a free sample.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.980
Literally it's like floating in the vial.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.523
- And so if you open that up,

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.590
you can take out, this is a
bag of about 1.5 kilograms

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.563
of graphene fits in a 30 gallon container.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.863
So it's very light,
sort of very voluminous,

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.223
in it's sort of raw state.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.690
- [Cory] Vorbeck is introducing

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.160
its manufactured graphene powder

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.480
to all sorts of industrial
and consumer products,

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.513
like RFID tags, clothing, and even rubber.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.727
So you take the graphene,
you blend it into rubber,

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.660
and the rubber they use,
sort of big blenders almost,

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.873
that beat the rubber around,
mix the graphene into it,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.280
and what you get by mixing
the graphene with the rubber

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.640
is very high temperature capabilities,

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.193
and also very high strength.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.810
- Thinking about an application for this,

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.870
you talked about space ships right?

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.700
- Right.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.700
- You're going through
extremely high temperature

00:05:12.707 --> 00:05:13.710
to extremely cold
temperature in out  er space,

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:14.970
you don't want rubber that
would expand and contract

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.313
and lose its strength over time.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.323
- Exactly.

00:05:18.323 --> 00:05:19.450
- This material won't do that?

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.600
- That's exactly right.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.160
- [Cory] And on the electronics front,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.050
Vorbeck has created graphene based inks

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.063
that can be printed en mass
on standard printing presses.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.710
When printed on water proof
fabrics, they can be washed,

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.163
heated, ironed, wrinkled, and twisted,

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.773
without damaging the circuits.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.050
This is extremely promising for the future

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.870
of graphene based wearable electronics,

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.893
which John says we should be
on the lookout for in 2019.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:47.540
- What we really hope is
that we can walk into a room,

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.490
five years from now, and
most people in that room

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.049
will have an article of clothing

00:05:53.049 --> 00:05:56.203
that has graphene wearable
electronics in it.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.610
- So there are big things
happening with graphene,

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.950
we just have to be patient,

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.387
and we can't believe
everything we read about it.

00:06:02.387 --> 00:06:04.827
And for what it's worth,
we've been here before.

00:06:04.827 --> 00:06:06.980
- [Phillip] It's this sort
of long standing notion

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.150
of a wonder material.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.580
I think it does go back to
the dawn of the plastic age

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.400
in the 1920s and 1930s.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.809
You know, you saw all the
same kinds of promises

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:18.170
made for them,

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.870
that they were going to
be these wonder materials

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.163
that would do everything.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.280
- I just want to say one
word to you, just one word.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.000
- Yes sir?

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.620
- Are you listening?

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.920
- Yes sir, I am.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.933
- Plastics.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.410
- [Phillip] Plastics, you know,

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.110
they clearly had a huge impact

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.523
and they do all kinds of useful things,

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.220
but they have their limitations too.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.160
I guess it was really a sort of reference

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.540
to this sort of longstanding
idea of wonder materials

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.933
that were you know, going to
solve every problem.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.840
- Graphene might not be a wonder material

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.580
any more than plastic is,
but the way John sees it,

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.560
if graphene works well on its own merits,

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.010
the hype won't matter at all.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.166
- We really don't want
our customers to care

00:07:05.166 --> 00:07:07.170
whether it's graphene or not.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:11.453
What we want them to
know is that this thing,

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.903
this device that you're
using, works better,

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.113
for longer, than anything
else you can get.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.850
And whether it has graphene in it,

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.500
whether they advertise
it and use that hype

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.980
as part of the marketing or not,

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.340
is sort of completely irrelevant.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.453
It just is better.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.360
- Hey everyone, thanks for watching.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.710
