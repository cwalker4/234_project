00:00:14.488 --> 00:00:15.221
MOVEMENT URGING DEMOCRATS THAT

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:19.425
IT'S CALLED THE WALK

00:00:19.426 --> 00:00:19.992
AWAY THE MOVEMENT AND

00:00:19.993 --> 00:00:20.526
ITS GAINING SERIOUS

00:00:20.527 --> 00:00:22.295

THAT FRIDAY.

00:00:28.268 --> 00:00:28.901
I CAN'T BELIEVE OVER THE

00:00:28.902 --> 00:00:29.469
WEEKEND THAT'S ALL I

00:00:30.604 --> 00:00:32.672
I KNOW TURNING POINTS

00:00:32.673 --> 00:00:33.239
WORKING ON A SIMILAR

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.806
CAMPAIGN, BUT EXPLAIN

00:00:33.807 --> 00:00:35.675
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

00:00:35.676 --> 00:00:36.375
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S THE MOST

00:00:36.376 --> 00:00:36.943
NATURAL THING IN THE

00:00:36.944 --> 00:00:41.247
WORLD TRICK

00:00:41.248 --> 00:00:41.848
UNFORTUNATELY THE LEFT

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:42.482
AND DEMOCRATS, THE PARTY

00:00:43.784 --> 00:00:44.350
MILLENNIAL'S WHO HAVE

00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:48.654
BECOME VIOLENT-- THEY

00:00:48.655 --> 00:00:49.255
HAVE BECOME VIOLENT AND

00:00:49.256 --> 00:00:49.889
EXTREME AND BEYOND THAT

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.658
THEY HAVE RADICAL IDEAS.

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:53.192
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

00:00:53.193 --> 00:00:53.826
SOCIALISM AS A PLATFORM,

00:00:53.827 --> 00:00:57.130
WHICH AS WE BOTH KNOW

00:00:57.131 --> 00:00:57.663
HAS OVER 100 PIT--

00:00:57.664 --> 00:00:58.297
100 MILLION PEOPLE OVER

00:00:58.298 --> 00:00:59.465
THE LAST 100 YEARS.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.601
LEFT ANYMORE.

00:01:01.602 --> 00:01:03.870
CHARLES: THE NOTION ALSO MET

00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:05.705
PEOPLE ARE NOW BRAVE ENOUGH TO

00:01:05.706 --> 00:01:06.372
WALKWAY REMAINED MISSING YOU

00:01:06.373 --> 00:01:08.908
TAKE AIKEN'S CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.244
OF BACKLASH IF YOU ARE PART OF

00:01:11.245 --> 00:01:12.778
ANY SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:16.682
THAT'S EXPECTED TO BE DEMOCRAT

00:01:16.683 --> 00:01:17.383
AND PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED WHEN

00:01:17.384 --> 00:01:17.950
YOU'RE NOT A DEMOCRAT.

00:01:21.655 --> 00:01:22.188
AND NOT A DEMOCRAT

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.193
PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED.

00:01:27.194 --> 00:01:27.793
IF YOU ARE HISPANIC AND

00:01:27.794 --> 00:01:28.361
NOT A DEMOCRAT THEN

00:01:28.362 --> 00:01:28.928
PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED AND

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:29.428
IT TAKES A CERTAIN

00:01:31.165 --> 00:01:31.898
&gt;&gt; A DOZEN I THINK WHAT

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:32.498
WE CAN CONTRIBUTE THIS

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:34.100
TO HIS SOCIAL MEDIA.

00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:34.567
SOCIAL MEDIA HAS

00:01:34.568 --> 00:01:35.134
PROVIDED THAT COURAGE

00:01:35.135 --> 00:01:37.103
BECAUSE YOU LOOK AROUND

00:01:37.104 --> 00:01:37.670
AND YOU SEE SO MANY

00:01:37.671 --> 00:01:38.271
LIKE-MINDED INDIVIDUALS

00:01:38.272 --> 00:01:40.973
POP UP.

00:01:40.974 --> 00:01:41.641
ME AS A BLACK PERSON WHO

00:01:41.642 --> 00:01:42.275
SAYS I HAVE CONSERVATIVE

00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:46.512
ME LIKE CONDOLEEZZA RICE

00:01:46.513 --> 00:01:48.681
AND DOCTOR BEN CARSON

00:01:48.682 --> 00:01:49.315
DIDN'T HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA

00:01:51.618 --> 00:01:52.618
SPRINGBOARD OFF THEIR

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.319
IDEAS AND MAKE IT OKAY

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.889
TO COME OUT.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:57.523
THE WALKWAY #WAS STARTED

00:01:57.524 --> 00:01:59.992
BY A GAY HAIRDRESSER IN

00:01:59.993 --> 00:02:00.726
NEW YORK CITY SO WE SEE

00:02:00.727 --> 00:02:02.128
SO MAY PEOPLE POP UP AND

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:02.762
AS I SAID IT'S JUST THE

00:02:02.763 --> 00:02:04.330
BEGINNING.

00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:04.964
I REALLY DO BELIEVE WE

00:02:04.965 --> 00:02:06.599
ARE SEEING THE END OF

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.535
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AS

00:02:10.737 --> 00:02:13.739
THAT SAME NOTE.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.407
THERE IS A POLL ACTUALLY

00:02:14.408 --> 00:02:14.974
MILLENNIAL'S SUPPORTED

00:02:14.975 --> 00:02:18.444
DEMOCRATS WERE CONGRESS

00:02:18.445 --> 00:02:18.978
SOMETHING BY NINE

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:19.612
PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE

00:02:19.613 --> 00:02:20.112
LAST COUPLE YEARS.

00:02:20.113 --> 00:02:21.380
LISTEN, IT SEEMS LIKE

00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:21.981
THERE'S A MASSIVE SHIFT

00:02:21.982 --> 00:02:25.918
TO THE GOP, BUT

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:26.519
PARTICULARLY AWAY FROM

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.986
DEMOCRATS AMONG

00:02:26.987 --> 00:02:27.887
MILLENNIAL'S.

00:02:27.888 --> 00:02:28.487
WHAT YOU MAKE OF THAT?

00:02:28.488 --> 00:02:30.223
&gt;&gt; WELL, LOOK AT SOME OF

00:02:30.224 --> 00:02:31.791
THE FACTS OR CLICK AT

00:02:31.792 --> 00:02:32.391
THE PRIORITIES ON THE

00:02:32.392 --> 00:02:37.396
LEFT.

00:02:37.397 --> 00:02:37.997
THEY HAVE BEEN HIGHLY

00:02:37.998 --> 00:02:38.531
FOCUSED ON ILLEGAL

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:41.968
IMMIGRANTS SEPARATED

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:42.568
FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.135
YET WE SEE THERE ARE

00:02:43.136 --> 00:02:43.703
MILLIONS OF KIDS IN

00:02:43.704 --> 00:02:46.539
FOSTER CARE AND MILLIONS

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.173
OF KIDS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:02:47.174 --> 00:02:47.673
SEPARATED BY THEIR

00:02:47.674 --> 00:02:48.241
PARENTS THAT ARE IN

00:02:51.345 --> 00:02:51.944
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO

00:02:51.945 --> 00:02:52.545
WAKE UP AND UNDERSTAND

00:02:52.546 --> 00:02:54.480
THEIR INTEREST HAS NOT

00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:55.181
BEEN FOR US IN A LONG

00:02:55.182 --> 00:02:55.815
TIME AND THEY HAVE BEEN

00:02:55.816 --> 00:02:58.985
INSISTING ON USING OUR

00:02:58.986 --> 00:02:59.552
IDENTITIES WHETHER WE

00:02:59.553 --> 00:03:01.787
ARE BLACK OR SEXUAL

00:03:01.788 --> 00:03:02.321
ORIENTATION, GAY,

00:03:02.322 --> 00:03:02.888
LESBIAN TO SORT OF

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:04.257
STRAPLESS GOWN INTO THIS

00:03:04.258 --> 00:03:06.425
DEMOCRATIC PARTY

00:03:10.397 --> 00:03:10.930
A MOVEMENT TOWARDS

00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:12.665
ULTIMATELY INDIVIDUALISM

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:13.366
CHARLES: IN THIS THE TICKLER

00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:19.772
PAUL WHITE MEN 18 TO MAKE 34,

00:03:19.773 --> 00:03:20.539
FOR DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS THAT

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.907
NUMBERS DOWN TO MAKE 37%.

00:03:21.908 --> 00:03:25.378
IDENTITY POLITICS AND

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.945
THE SELLING OF GUILT

00:03:25.946 --> 00:03:28.281
SEEMS TO BE BACKFIRING

00:03:28.282 --> 00:03:28.881
IN THE NOTION EVERYONE

00:03:28.882 --> 00:03:30.116
SHOULD BE GUILTY OR

00:03:30.117 --> 00:03:31.117
ANGRY OR HAVE SOME SORT

00:03:31.118 --> 00:03:33.686
OF ANIMOSITY AGAINST

00:03:33.687 --> 00:03:34.320
SOMEONE THAT'S NOT LIKE

00:03:34.321 --> 00:03:36.555
THEM WHETHER IT'S INCOME

00:03:36.556 --> 00:03:37.189
RELATED TO RACE RELATED

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.357
OR SEXUALLY ORIENTATION.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.130
DEVASTATION THAT'S

00:03:44.131 --> 00:03:44.630
HAPPENING TO THE

00:03:44.631 --> 00:03:45.498
DEMOCRATS.

00:03:48.902 --> 00:03:49.502
THAT'S WHY I CREATED MY

00:03:49.503 --> 00:03:51.170
YOUTUBE PAGE INITIALLY I

00:03:51.171 --> 00:03:53.973
SAW THIS THIS MOVEMENT

00:03:53.974 --> 00:03:55.141
HAPPENING.

00:03:55.142 --> 00:03:55.741
LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE

00:03:55.742 --> 00:03:56.342
SELLING AND ADJECTIVES

00:03:56.343 --> 00:03:56.942
YOU JUST USE, GUILT.

00:03:56.943 --> 00:03:59.178
THAT TYPE-- IDEA BEING

00:03:59.179 --> 00:03:59.812
OPPRESSED AND ANGRY AS A

00:03:59.813 --> 00:04:02.848
VICTIM AND WHAT WE

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:03.316
OFFERS FREEDOM,

00:04:03.317 --> 00:04:05.685
HAPPINESS, INDIVIDUALISM

00:04:05.686 --> 00:04:06.319
IN A WAY TO PROGRESS

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.652
FORWARD.

00:04:06.653 --> 00:04:08.587
WHAT WILL IT WHEN AND IN

00:04:08.588 --> 00:04:12.726
OR NEGATIVITY?
