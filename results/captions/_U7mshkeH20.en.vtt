00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.583
(upbeat music)

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.112
- I hated that job and
I clung to that job.

00:00:14.112 --> 00:00:15.902
Ten years in a place without heat,

00:00:15.902 --> 00:00:18.588
six years at a job I felt stuck in,

00:00:18.588 --> 00:00:21.736
maybe I was afraid of change.

00:00:21.736 --> 00:00:22.569
Are you?

00:00:24.616 --> 00:00:27.559
When I was 29, I told myself

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:29.281
the next acting job I get,

00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:30.938
no matter what it pays,

00:00:30.938 --> 00:00:34.613
I will from now on, for better or worse,

00:00:34.613 --> 00:00:36.169
be a working actor.

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:38.682
And now I didn't have either the internet

00:00:38.682 --> 00:00:40.993
or a cell phone or a job,

00:00:40.993 --> 00:00:42.395
but something good happened.

00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:43.790
I got a low-paying theater job

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.707
in a play called Imperfect Love,

00:00:46.707 --> 00:00:51.412
which led to a film called 13
Moons with the same writer,

00:00:51.412 --> 00:00:54.537
which led to other roles,
which led to other roles

00:00:54.537 --> 00:00:56.762
and I've worked as an actor ever since.

00:00:56.762 --> 00:00:59.758
I didn't know that would happen.

00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:03.175
At 29, walking away from data processing,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.807
I was terrified, but this made
me very hungry, literally.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.216
(audience laughs)

00:01:12.216 --> 00:01:13.646
I couldn't be lazy.

00:01:13.646 --> 00:01:15.396
Now I tell this story

00:01:16.496 --> 00:01:18.829
because the world might say,

00:01:20.157 --> 00:01:22.047
you are not allowed to yet.

00:01:22.047 --> 00:01:24.714
Please don't even bother asking,

00:01:27.508 --> 00:01:30.737
don't bother telling
the world you are ready,

00:01:30.737 --> 00:01:31.570
show it,

00:01:32.695 --> 00:01:34.109
do it,

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.942
trust me,

00:01:35.884 --> 00:01:37.301
a rhythm sets in.

00:01:38.286 --> 00:01:41.427
Just try not to wait until like me,

00:01:41.427 --> 00:01:43.760
you're 29 before you find it

00:01:45.442 --> 00:01:46.819
and if you are that's fine too.

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.986
Some of us never find it,
but you will, I promise you.

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:55.844
Raise the rest of your life to meet you.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.044
Don't search for defining moments

00:01:59.044 --> 00:02:00.875
because they will never come.

00:02:00.875 --> 00:02:04.177
The moments that define
you have already happened

00:02:04.177 --> 00:02:06.112
and they will already happen again.

00:02:06.112 --> 00:02:09.080
Don't wait until they tell you

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.497
you are ready, get in there.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.763
I waited a long time out in the world

00:02:15.763 --> 00:02:18.766
before I gave myself permission to fail.

00:02:18.766 --> 00:02:20.638
What did Beckett say?

00:02:20.638 --> 00:02:22.638
Ever tried, ever failed,

00:02:24.123 --> 00:02:25.873
no matter, try again,

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:29.179
fail again, fail better,

00:02:30.722 --> 00:02:32.305
the world is yours.

00:02:34.697 --> 00:02:39.397
Treat everyone kindly in
the light of the night.

00:02:39.397 --> 00:02:42.397
(audience applauds)

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:48.633
- You know my mother had me

00:02:48.633 --> 00:02:50.499
when she was 16 years old

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:51.775
and I used to sleep on the floor

00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:53.629
and I had eight uncles in that same house

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.142
and they they did
everything under the sun,

00:02:56.142 --> 00:02:57.973
you know, going in and out of prison

00:02:57.973 --> 00:02:59.454
and my mother she worked at Wendy's

00:02:59.454 --> 00:03:01.504
and she would get off work at Wendy's

00:03:01.504 --> 00:03:03.340
and I would be about the
last kid sitting in the park

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.212
and I'll be waiting on my mother

00:03:05.212 --> 00:03:06.362
because I didn't want to go home

00:03:06.362 --> 00:03:08.129
because you know every other day

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.850
or every other week our front
door would get kicked in

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.212
because my uncles, they sold drugs,

00:03:14.212 --> 00:03:16.013
so every opportunity I got in solitude

00:03:16.013 --> 00:03:18.285
to cultivate a vision for my life,

00:03:18.285 --> 00:03:19.447
I took advantage of it,

00:03:19.447 --> 00:03:21.256
but one night my mother came into the park

00:03:21.256 --> 00:03:23.420
and I walked off the field and I said,

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.553
can you please introduce me to my father

00:03:26.553 --> 00:03:27.711
because I played every sport

00:03:27.711 --> 00:03:29.549
and every sport I played,

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.877
we had to show our birth certificate

00:03:31.877 --> 00:03:33.814
and so every time I pulled
out my birth certificate

00:03:33.814 --> 00:03:35.622
I would always see my mother's name,

00:03:35.622 --> 00:03:36.915
but I never saw my father's name,

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:38.831
and so it bother me.

00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:41.163
So she says sure and so my
first encounter with my father,

00:03:41.163 --> 00:03:42.739
I shook his hand, I said,
"Hey man, how you doing?"

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:43.850
He said, Hey little man.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.450
He said, man I heard you
could really play sports.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.472
I said, thanks I heard you can too.

00:03:47.472 --> 00:03:49.069
I said, but here's what
I need you to do for me.

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.773
I need you to pick me
up every Friday night,

00:03:50.773 --> 00:03:52.621
book me out every Saturday morning

00:03:52.621 --> 00:03:53.998
and you can take me back home after that.

00:03:53.998 --> 00:03:56.110
I don't need any money,
I don't need any clothes.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.509
I just need to make it to the NFL,

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:59.326
so I can help my mother
and my grandmother.

00:03:59.326 --> 00:04:00.798
Can you do that?

00:04:00.798 --> 00:04:02.233
He said, Yeah, I gotcha.

00:04:02.233 --> 00:04:03.597
So he picked me up on Friday night,

00:04:03.597 --> 00:04:05.114
the first Saturday morning he shakes me,

00:04:05.114 --> 00:04:06.611
it's 4:00 a.m. in the morning.

00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:08.600
I wake up, I'm wiping
the coal out of my eyes.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.971
He said, Little man you
said you wanted it, right?

00:04:10.971 --> 00:04:12.101
I said, Yes sir.

00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:13.230
He said, Get up, we're running two miles

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.490
to this five station two miles back home.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.037
I said, Okay, let's do it

00:04:17.037 --> 00:04:19.028
and so he walks by me and
he busted a u-turn and

00:04:19.028 --> 00:04:20.243
he looked up at me, he said, Son.

00:04:20.243 --> 00:04:21.076
I said, Yes sir.

00:04:21.076 --> 00:04:21.909
He said, I want you to pull

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:24.308
that other person outside of you.

00:04:24.308 --> 00:04:25.408
No disrespect, I said,

00:04:25.408 --> 00:04:28.175
but I don't see another person.

00:04:28.175 --> 00:04:30.276
I said, so I understand
we have different lives

00:04:30.276 --> 00:04:32.542
and you have your job
and so, if you're tired,

00:04:32.542 --> 00:04:33.823
I get it you can go back in the house

00:04:33.823 --> 00:04:35.712
and you go to sleep, but
you're not stopping me

00:04:35.712 --> 00:04:37.037
from running to this fire station.

00:04:37.037 --> 00:04:38.561
I'm running to this fire station,

00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:40.338
whether you go or not.

00:04:40.338 --> 00:04:41.868
and he looked at me
and what he said to me,

00:04:41.868 --> 00:04:43.376
it pierced my heart in such a way.

00:04:43.376 --> 00:04:45.429
He said, Son, what I'm trying
to get you to understand

00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:46.900
is no matter how hard you work,

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.308
there is somebody on the inside of you

00:04:48.308 --> 00:04:49.918
that works even harder.

00:04:49.918 --> 00:04:51.167
He said, No matter how dedicated you are,

00:04:51.167 --> 00:04:52.538
there is somebody on the inside of you

00:04:52.538 --> 00:04:53.397
that's more dedicated.

00:04:53.397 --> 00:04:54.749
No matter how committed you are,

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:56.154
there was somebody on the inside of you

00:04:56.154 --> 00:04:57.217
that's more committed

00:04:57.217 --> 00:04:58.661
and you don't even know
what commitment is yet.

00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:00.149
You think commitment is just saying,

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:01.735
yes sir, I will, but what commitment is,

00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:03.200
commitment is staying
true to what you said

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.042
you were going to do long after the mood

00:05:05.042 --> 00:05:06.375
that you have said it in has left,

00:05:06.375 --> 00:05:07.208
meaning on the days when you

00:05:07.208 --> 00:05:08.490
don't feel like doing what you

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.362
said you would do, you get up

00:05:09.362 --> 00:05:10.483
and you do it anyway.

00:05:10.483 --> 00:05:12.132
That's what builds character

00:05:12.132 --> 00:05:13.832
and he said, I need you
to understand the concept

00:05:13.832 --> 00:05:16.100
that there's another
person on the inside of you

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.643
because one day in your
life you will face something

00:05:18.643 --> 00:05:19.643
that's a lot tougher than you

00:05:19.643 --> 00:05:20.876
and your strength and your drive

00:05:20.876 --> 00:05:23.074
and your commitment and
your work ethic won't do it

00:05:23.074 --> 00:05:24.362
you have to realize that it's something

00:05:24.362 --> 00:05:26.481
on the inside of you that's
greater than anything

00:05:26.481 --> 00:05:29.551
that life can throw at
you and immediately I got.

00:05:29.551 --> 00:05:30.587
And so when my life changed

00:05:30.587 --> 00:05:32.336
not only did my football career end,

00:05:32.336 --> 00:05:34.586
I got a paralyzed right arm and hand.

00:05:35.553 --> 00:05:37.489
Life changed overnight,

00:05:37.489 --> 00:05:39.206
but I was extremely grateful for

00:05:39.206 --> 00:05:41.707
because the whole time I understood

00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:43.526
that you have to tap into in order

00:05:43.526 --> 00:05:45.059
to get through one of
the darkest, toughest,

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:46.570
roughest moments of your life,

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.472
there's another person on the inside.

00:05:49.472 --> 00:05:52.055
(upbeat music)

00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:59.435
- This was my shot.

00:05:59.435 --> 00:06:00.668
I cried a lot.

00:06:00.668 --> 00:06:02.768
It was so embarrassing.

00:06:02.768 --> 00:06:05.482
I got fired from Frasier,
the one everyone knew

00:06:05.482 --> 00:06:08.162
was going to be a hit and it was.

00:06:08.162 --> 00:06:11.253
This time it was really hard not to think

00:06:11.253 --> 00:06:14.531
that it wasn't meant to be,
my career as an actress.

00:06:14.531 --> 00:06:15.570
A couple of months later,

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.160
I was almost completely out of money.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.009
Then I got a call from a
friend, the actor Richard Kind,

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:26.325
who said, and this is
exactly how he sounds,

00:06:26.325 --> 00:06:28.318
I heard what happened.

00:06:28.318 --> 00:06:30.953
I don't know how you
get up in the morning.

00:06:30.953 --> 00:06:33.224
(audience laughs)

00:06:33.224 --> 00:06:36.021
How do you even get out of bed,

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:38.857
get dressed, walk out the
door and show your face?

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:41.584
(audience laughs)

00:06:41.584 --> 00:06:43.436
I was getting up in the morning

00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:44.844
and leaving my apartment,

00:06:44.844 --> 00:06:47.955
so maybe I was coping better
than I was expected to.

00:06:47.955 --> 00:06:50.764
That's a good sign and I understand that

00:06:50.764 --> 00:06:53.637
because the '20s, they are
at that time in your life

00:06:53.637 --> 00:06:56.519
when you're really getting
acquainted to self-doubt.

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:58.723
When there's so much seemingly at stake,

00:06:58.723 --> 00:07:02.089
so let me reassure you, it's
not supposed to be easy.

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:04.644
You're supposed to have
moments of uncertainty

00:07:04.644 --> 00:07:06.456
about which path to take

00:07:06.456 --> 00:07:09.012
because the '20s are full of crossroads.

00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:12.039
And when one door closes,
another door always opens.

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:13.236
It really does.

00:07:13.236 --> 00:07:14.811
That's what I would tell myself

00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:18.196
to keep those moments
of doubts only moments

00:07:18.196 --> 00:07:20.909
and it worked I kept going.

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:24.326
Then it all changed after many auditions,

00:07:26.217 --> 00:07:27.690
I was the second person cast

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.656
in the pilot called Friends Like Us,

00:07:30.656 --> 00:07:33.100
which would later be changed to Friends.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.553
Jim Burrows also directed this pilot

00:07:35.553 --> 00:07:37.527
and the first 10 episodes of Friends.

00:07:37.527 --> 00:07:39.742
One day the six of us
were talking with Jimmy

00:07:39.742 --> 00:07:42.992
exchanging the time I got fired stories

00:07:43.903 --> 00:07:45.986
and Jimmy told them mine.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.532
Well, she's got the worst one of all.

00:07:49.532 --> 00:07:52.571
She got fired from Freddie Jerk.

00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:54.146
Well, it's a good thing you got fired,

00:07:54.146 --> 00:07:56.550
or you wouldn't have been on this show.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.432
He was right.

00:07:58.432 --> 00:08:01.554
And it was a good thing I
didn't get Saturday Night Live

00:08:01.554 --> 00:08:03.231
and that Romy and Michele, that

00:08:03.231 --> 00:08:04.626
that pilot didn't work out

00:08:04.626 --> 00:08:07.268
and every other
disappointment that happened.

00:08:07.268 --> 00:08:10.456
They were actually more like guideposts

00:08:10.456 --> 00:08:12.465
that kept me on my path.

00:08:12.465 --> 00:08:15.095
Oh and after I got fired from Frasier,

00:08:15.095 --> 00:08:16.747
I went to a birthday party and feeling

00:08:16.747 --> 00:08:19.893
like I had nothing at all to lose.

00:08:19.893 --> 00:08:22.995
I flirted with a guy, who
was way out of my league,

00:08:22.995 --> 00:08:25.126
we dated and on Thursday, Michel and I

00:08:25.126 --> 00:08:27.585
will have been married for 15 years

00:08:27.585 --> 00:08:31.555
and we'll celebrate with our
remarkable twelve-year-old son.

00:08:31.555 --> 00:08:33.638
So thank God I got fired,

00:08:34.519 --> 00:08:36.558
there is a reason for everything.

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:39.141
(upbeat music)

00:08:44.528 --> 00:08:45.478
- I had a lot of failures.

00:08:45.478 --> 00:08:48.423
I feel for funny things that I failed at

00:08:48.423 --> 00:08:52.053
a key primary school tests for two times

00:08:52.053 --> 00:08:55.886
and I failed three times
for the middle school

00:08:56.782 --> 00:08:58.318
you know for three years I tried,

00:08:58.318 --> 00:08:59.922
failing the universities

00:08:59.922 --> 00:09:03.672
So I applied jobs for
30 times, got rejected.

00:09:05.063 --> 00:09:08.030
I went for a police, they
said, no, you're not good.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.709
I went to even the KFC.

00:09:10.709 --> 00:09:14.126
When KFC came to China, come to our city,

00:09:15.416 --> 00:09:17.666
24 people went for the job,

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:20.872
23 people accepted,

00:09:20.872 --> 00:09:23.317
I was the only one guy,

00:09:23.317 --> 00:09:27.072
and we went for police, five
people, four of them accepted.

00:09:27.072 --> 00:09:29.662
I was the only guy did not receive it.

00:09:29.662 --> 00:09:32.954
So to me being turned down, rejected,

00:09:32.954 --> 00:09:34.131
oh by the way, I told you

00:09:34.131 --> 00:09:38.209
that I applied for Harvard
for ten times rejected.

00:09:38.209 --> 00:09:39.468
(audience laughs)

00:09:39.468 --> 00:09:43.811
I know I'll be rejected,
I just wanted to say that.

00:09:43.811 --> 00:09:45.835
I think we have to get used to it,

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:48.200
we're not that good even today,

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.546
we still have a lot of people reject us.

00:09:50.546 --> 00:09:52.707
I don't think in this
world a lot of people

00:09:52.707 --> 00:09:55.651
be rejected more than 30 times.

00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:58.698
If we, you know the only
thing we never give up,

00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:00.880
the only thing like,
we're like a Forrest Gump.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.814
We keep on fight, we
keep on change ourself.

00:10:03.814 --> 00:10:04.872
We don't complain.

00:10:04.872 --> 00:10:06.869
Whether you are
successful, not successful.

00:10:06.869 --> 00:10:11.036
I find that when people
when they finish the job,

00:10:11.036 --> 00:10:13.719
if they make a mistake and they fail,

00:10:13.719 --> 00:10:17.336
if they always complete the others,

00:10:17.336 --> 00:10:19.245
this guy will never come back.

00:10:19.245 --> 00:10:21.662
If the guy only check himself

00:10:22.772 --> 00:10:24.173
yeah, something wrong with me here,

00:10:24.173 --> 00:10:25.783
something won't be there.

00:10:25.783 --> 00:10:26.871
This guy has a hope.

00:10:26.871 --> 00:10:29.454
(upbeat music)

00:10:34.846 --> 00:10:38.762
- I said yes when I wanted to say no,

00:10:38.762 --> 00:10:40.277
I don't want to do that.

00:10:40.277 --> 00:10:42.884
He became physically violent with me.

00:10:42.884 --> 00:10:46.723
I'd never been in an
abusive relationship before.

00:10:46.723 --> 00:10:51.097
I felt as if I didn't have
the profile of a woman

00:10:51.097 --> 00:10:54.771
who would ever be abused
verbally, emotionally

00:10:54.771 --> 00:10:56.864
and sure not physically.

00:10:56.864 --> 00:11:00.380
And I remember when that
relationship finally ended

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.279
and I was grateful that
it ended and I was alive

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:04.491
because there are some days

00:11:04.491 --> 00:11:06.755
when my life was in danger.

00:11:06.755 --> 00:11:10.005
I had so much guilt and anger and blame

00:11:11.321 --> 00:11:13.779
and more than anything shame.

00:11:13.779 --> 00:11:15.362
How did I get here?

00:11:16.553 --> 00:11:20.105
And the bigger question
was how will I get out?

00:11:20.105 --> 00:11:21.671
How do I move from this place?

00:11:21.671 --> 00:11:23.599
I remember sitting in the doctor's office,

00:11:23.599 --> 00:11:24.666
sitting on the table

00:11:24.666 --> 00:11:27.140
and she asked me a myriad of questions.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.540
She left the room and came back

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.847
with a piece of paper in her hand

00:11:29.847 --> 00:11:33.847
and she said, Lisa, you
are clinically depressed

00:11:34.766 --> 00:11:36.274
and I need to give you this prescription

00:11:36.274 --> 00:11:37.809
and I looked at the piece of paper

00:11:37.809 --> 00:11:40.642
and it said Lisa Nichols, Prozac.

00:11:49.074 --> 00:11:52.271
I didn't see that level of sad coming.

00:11:52.271 --> 00:11:55.454
I think when sad comes,
you don't know it's coming.

00:11:55.454 --> 00:11:57.682
It's a little, one little circumstance,

00:11:57.682 --> 00:12:00.164
another circumstance,
another missed moment

00:12:00.164 --> 00:12:01.409
where you don't speak your mind,

00:12:01.409 --> 00:12:03.991
another moment when you don't
say what's on your heart,

00:12:03.991 --> 00:12:05.692
another moment when you say yes

00:12:05.692 --> 00:12:07.642
and you really wanted to say no,

00:12:07.642 --> 00:12:09.003
another moment when you just

00:12:09.003 --> 00:12:11.637
put everyone else in front of you

00:12:11.637 --> 00:12:13.855
and here I was in the doctor's office,

00:12:13.855 --> 00:12:15.605
clinically depressed.

00:12:16.683 --> 00:12:20.230
I asked my doctor could
I do something before

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.165
I fulfilled the prescription?

00:12:22.165 --> 00:12:23.899
Could I try something else?

00:12:23.899 --> 00:12:26.072
Because when she said I
was really, really sad

00:12:26.072 --> 00:12:26.958
what I realized was that

00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.897
I had just forgot who I was.

00:12:29.897 --> 00:12:32.872
That I had become Jilani's
mom, that's all I was.

00:12:32.872 --> 00:12:35.257
I'd become his fiancee, that's all I was

00:12:35.257 --> 00:12:37.108
and then I was the woman that he abused

00:12:37.108 --> 00:12:38.797
and then I was the daughter trying

00:12:38.797 --> 00:12:40.770
to hide the abuse from
my father and my mother

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.593
and then I was the motivational speaker

00:12:42.593 --> 00:12:45.722
trying to hide the fact that
I was sad from everyone.

00:12:45.722 --> 00:12:49.397
I just forgot who I was and so I asked her

00:12:49.397 --> 00:12:53.064
can I have 30 days to
just discover me again

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.417
and I did three things.

00:12:58.074 --> 00:13:00.529
One, I put affirmations
all around my house

00:13:00.529 --> 00:13:01.935
reminding me who I was,

00:13:01.935 --> 00:13:03.974
you are an unrepeatable miracle,

00:13:03.974 --> 00:13:06.033
you are beautiful in your own right,

00:13:06.033 --> 00:13:08.692
you are, you deserve healthy love,

00:13:08.692 --> 00:13:10.003
you are a child of God,

00:13:10.003 --> 00:13:11.841
everywhere I could look at my house

00:13:11.841 --> 00:13:15.227
was Post-It note
reminding me of who I was.

00:13:15.227 --> 00:13:17.622
I read scriptures and I read words

00:13:17.622 --> 00:13:21.082
that showed me my birthright
and then every day

00:13:21.082 --> 00:13:24.420
I got in the mirror and I
completed three sentences.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:25.737
I looked in my eyes and I said,

00:13:25.737 --> 00:13:28.099
Lisa, I'm proud that you

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:31.059
and I found seven things
to celebrate Lisa for

00:13:31.059 --> 00:13:32.111
and the second sentence was

00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:34.607
Lisa, I forgive you for

00:13:34.607 --> 00:13:36.130
and I found seven different things

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.198
to cut the shackles of blame, shame,

00:13:38.198 --> 00:13:41.155
guilt, regret and anger around

00:13:41.155 --> 00:13:43.992
and I said, Lisa, I commit to you that

00:13:43.992 --> 00:13:46.680
and I made seven different
commitments to myself

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.854
every day for 30 days and
when I went back to the doctor

00:13:50.854 --> 00:13:53.412
I was completely ready
to take the prescription

00:13:53.412 --> 00:13:54.871
and fill it if I needed to.

00:13:54.871 --> 00:13:56.468
When I share it with her,
she asked me question

00:13:56.468 --> 00:13:58.440
after question after question again.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.771
Then at the end, she goes I have

00:13:59.771 --> 00:14:01.112
two questions for you, Lisa.

00:14:01.112 --> 00:14:03.151
I said what, she said
what have you been doing

00:14:03.151 --> 00:14:04.769
for the last 30 days

00:14:04.769 --> 00:14:06.582
and can I use it with other patients

00:14:06.582 --> 00:14:08.824
because I found my way back to me.

00:14:08.824 --> 00:14:13.473
And another moment that I'm
super, super grateful for

00:14:13.473 --> 00:14:16.559
was when my daddy took
me on my first date.

00:14:16.559 --> 00:14:18.985
I was 12 years old and he took me out

00:14:18.985 --> 00:14:22.282
to a restaurant on the
pier in Marina del Rey

00:14:22.282 --> 00:14:25.562
and he ordered my drink
and ordered my food

00:14:25.562 --> 00:14:28.174
and open the car door and all the things

00:14:28.174 --> 00:14:29.877
you would do on a great date that

00:14:29.877 --> 00:14:31.975
I didn't know anything about at 12.

00:14:31.975 --> 00:14:33.461
And at the end of the evening,

00:14:33.461 --> 00:14:34.875
I went to walk in the house

00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:37.916
and my father was opening,
holding the door open for me

00:14:37.916 --> 00:14:40.831
and he closed the door
so I could not get in

00:14:40.831 --> 00:14:44.207
and I stopped and I was
like, daddy what's wrong

00:14:44.207 --> 00:14:46.924
and he said I want you
to know something Lisa.

00:14:46.924 --> 00:14:49.216
Tonight I took you on your first date,

00:14:49.216 --> 00:14:52.626
so you get to see how
you get to be treated.

00:14:52.626 --> 00:14:56.051
I wanted you to see how
you get to be treated,

00:14:56.051 --> 00:14:59.475
now sweetheart, how you
choose to be treated,

00:14:59.475 --> 00:15:00.803
that's gonna be on you.

00:15:00.803 --> 00:15:02.856
The big moments in your life

00:15:02.856 --> 00:15:05.438
are made up by the little
decisions you make.

00:15:05.438 --> 00:15:07.273
I didn't make a big decision

00:15:07.273 --> 00:15:08.971
to get in an abusive relationship.

00:15:08.971 --> 00:15:12.643
I made a little decision
to lower my integrity bar.

00:15:12.643 --> 00:15:14.489
I made another little decision to stay

00:15:14.489 --> 00:15:17.465
when I saw the first sign
that he didn't honor me

00:15:17.465 --> 00:15:18.731
the way I deserve to be honored.

00:15:18.731 --> 00:15:21.965
I made a little decision
when I crossed over,

00:15:21.965 --> 00:15:23.929
moved past that moment of discomfort

00:15:23.929 --> 00:15:27.517
and allowed his words to
make up for his behavior.

00:15:27.517 --> 00:15:31.349
It was my job to fall madly
in love with me first,

00:15:31.349 --> 00:15:33.110
That no one was going to show me

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.623
how to love me, that I have to show not

00:15:35.623 --> 00:15:37.494
only me how to love me,

00:15:37.494 --> 00:15:39.818
but I had to show other
people how to love me.

00:15:39.818 --> 00:15:41.531
That you are the first example of

00:15:41.531 --> 00:15:43.958
what loving you looks like,
in the way you love you,

00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.501
is the way the world's gonna love you.

00:15:45.501 --> 00:15:48.786
So when you say I don't need
rest, then we believe you.

00:15:48.786 --> 00:15:50.503
When you say no, don't worry about me,

00:15:50.503 --> 00:15:51.887
I'm fine, we believe you.

00:15:51.887 --> 00:15:54.110
When you say no, I don't
need help, we believe you.

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:56.258
When you say I'm fine by
myself, we believe you.

00:15:56.258 --> 00:15:57.817
So, here's what I realized

00:15:57.817 --> 00:16:01.032
words are power, words, words speak life,

00:16:01.032 --> 00:16:03.443
words, your life as a
physical manifestation

00:16:03.443 --> 00:16:05.715
of the conversation going on in your head

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:07.615
and it's a physical
manifestation of the words

00:16:07.615 --> 00:16:09.001
that are falling across your lips

00:16:09.001 --> 00:16:10.540
and if you want to create a better life,

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.220
design a better conversation.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.570
If you want to design
a better conversation,

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.976
think about a thought, not about them,

00:16:15.976 --> 00:16:18.945
but first about you and if
you can feel it right now,

00:16:18.945 --> 00:16:20.562
something stirring in your soul,

00:16:20.562 --> 00:16:24.446
just that little something,
you can't even describe it

00:16:24.446 --> 00:16:26.663
then you're still in the game.

00:16:26.663 --> 00:16:27.990
It ain't over yet.

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:30.740
it's never too late at 20, at 40,

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.747
at 55, at 75, at 88,

00:16:36.952 --> 00:16:40.740
it ain't ever too late to press reset

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.915
and fall madly in love with the life

00:16:43.915 --> 00:16:46.235
that you've been given
and then you'll look up

00:16:46.235 --> 00:16:48.235
and your life is barely,

00:16:50.955 --> 00:16:55.122
then you look up and your
life is barely recognizable.

00:16:56.532 --> 00:16:59.959
I'm a girl from South Central LA.

00:16:59.959 --> 00:17:01.497
Living between the Harlequin '30s

00:17:01.497 --> 00:17:03.254
and the rollin' '60s,

00:17:03.254 --> 00:17:07.544
had three fights a week
to get home from school.

00:17:07.544 --> 00:17:09.754
Got kicked out of college,

00:17:09.754 --> 00:17:12.619
I was considered academically challenged.

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:15.369
I'm functionally dyslexic still.

00:17:20.269 --> 00:17:23.278
I wear everything as a badge.

00:17:23.278 --> 00:17:24.695
I'm fine with it.

00:17:26.214 --> 00:17:28.972
I'm not successful in spite of it.

00:17:28.972 --> 00:17:31.790
My success is beautiful because of it.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.572
I'm that woman who was on
government assistance, okay.

00:17:34.572 --> 00:17:37.623
I'm that woman who got out of
abusive relationship, okay.

00:17:37.623 --> 00:17:39.953
But I'm also that woman who's authored

00:17:39.953 --> 00:17:42.197
or co-authored seven bestsellers.

00:17:42.197 --> 00:17:43.447
I'm also that woman who's a CEO

00:17:43.447 --> 00:17:45.504
of a multi-million dollar business.

00:17:45.504 --> 00:17:47.618
I'm also the woman who
has an international brand

00:17:47.618 --> 00:17:49.882
and touches over 30 million people a year.

00:17:49.882 --> 00:17:52.913
I'm also that woman, don't wear the labels

00:17:52.913 --> 00:17:55.075
and don't let the labels wear you.

00:17:55.075 --> 00:17:56.578
You're bigger than a label.

00:17:56.578 --> 00:17:58.457
I'm a woman before I'm a mother.

00:17:58.457 --> 00:18:00.308
I'm a woman before I'm a CEO.

00:18:00.308 --> 00:18:01.864
I'm a woman before I'm a daughter.

00:18:01.864 --> 00:18:04.475
I'm a woman first, all things.

00:18:04.475 --> 00:18:07.513
I'm not a hero I want to be a she-ro.

00:18:07.513 --> 00:18:09.820
And I want to give her a chance

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.385
and I say to you as your sister,

00:18:12.385 --> 00:18:14.174
you don't think you get to press reset,

00:18:14.174 --> 00:18:17.034
you better think again, it is not over.

00:18:17.034 --> 00:18:19.979
Matter of fact, it just begun.

00:18:19.979 --> 00:18:22.562
(upbeat music)

00:18:28.168 --> 00:18:31.460
- I was born with a silver
spoon in my mouth, I know.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.000
I was born in Follansbee, West Virginia.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.010
(audience laughs)

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:40.177
And I went by where I was
born last night about 10:30.

00:18:41.914 --> 00:18:46.081
I was born in a cellar at
home delivered by Dr. McGraw.

00:18:48.738 --> 00:18:52.905
We had one bedroom for my
sister, myself, and my parents.

00:18:53.992 --> 00:18:56.742
we had a half bath and a kitchen.

00:18:57.962 --> 00:19:00.774
Seven half years, we lived in that place.

00:19:00.774 --> 00:19:03.705
There was no welfare,
there was no food stamps,

00:19:03.705 --> 00:19:07.999
there was no safety net, but
I always had plenty to eat

00:19:07.999 --> 00:19:09.512
'cause every time I asked for seconds,

00:19:09.512 --> 00:19:11.507
my dad would say, no you had plenty.

00:19:11.507 --> 00:19:14.747
(audience laughs)

00:19:14.747 --> 00:19:16.410
But the reason I was
born with a silver spoon,

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:18.754
my dad had only gone to the third grade.

00:19:18.754 --> 00:19:21.154
That's all the education he had.

00:19:21.154 --> 00:19:23.331
But why was I born with a
silver spoon in my mouth

00:19:23.331 --> 00:19:26.593
because I was taught by my parents.

00:19:26.593 --> 00:19:28.791
That life's a matter of making choices,

00:19:28.791 --> 00:19:29.970
wherever you are good or bad

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:32.134
because of the choices you make.

00:19:32.134 --> 00:19:33.213
Don't blame anybody else.

00:19:33.213 --> 00:19:35.378
But if you get an education,
you're willing to work

00:19:35.378 --> 00:19:37.339
and overcome problems and difficulty.

00:19:37.339 --> 00:19:41.884
In this great country, you
can amount to something.

00:19:41.884 --> 00:19:43.743
That's why I was born with a silver spoon.

00:19:43.743 --> 00:19:44.643
I was in this country

00:19:44.643 --> 00:19:47.180
and I was taught personal responsibility

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.585
for choices you make.

00:19:49.585 --> 00:19:52.234
When we talk about a
commitment to excellence,

00:19:52.234 --> 00:19:54.518
that's a choice you make.

00:19:54.518 --> 00:19:56.717
What do you want to do,

00:19:56.717 --> 00:19:59.988
having hopes and dreams and ambition?

00:19:59.988 --> 00:20:01.725
See I think that is absolutely critical,

00:20:01.725 --> 00:20:04.063
don't make the mistake I made.

00:20:04.063 --> 00:20:04.929
I've done a lot of dumb things,

00:20:04.929 --> 00:20:06.963
but let me tell you
the one thing I regret.

00:20:06.963 --> 00:20:08.461
We went to the University of Notre Dame,

00:20:08.461 --> 00:20:09.929
we took a program on the bottom,

00:20:09.929 --> 00:20:11.650
we took it to the very top

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:12.952
and for nine straight years,

00:20:12.952 --> 00:20:14.586
we went to a January One Bowl;

00:20:14.586 --> 00:20:16.752
the Sugar, the Cotton, the
Orange, and the Fiesta.

00:20:16.752 --> 00:20:20.179
Nobody's done it before,
nobody's done it since.

00:20:20.179 --> 00:20:23.347
We put it on top and we maintained it.

00:20:23.347 --> 00:20:25.763
That's the thing I regret the most.

00:20:25.763 --> 00:20:27.172
See there's a rule in life that says

00:20:27.172 --> 00:20:30.871
you're either growing or you're dying.

00:20:30.871 --> 00:20:32.523
The tree's either growing or it's dying.

00:20:32.523 --> 00:20:34.805
So is grass, so is a marriage,

00:20:34.805 --> 00:20:37.302
so is a business, so is a person,

00:20:37.302 --> 00:20:38.752
doesn't have a thing to do with age.

00:20:38.752 --> 00:20:41.244
My birthday candles
cost more than the cake,

00:20:41.244 --> 00:20:42.717
(audience laughs)

00:20:42.717 --> 00:20:43.927
but it has everything to do with

00:20:43.927 --> 00:20:44.982
my trying to get better,

00:20:44.982 --> 00:20:46.661
my trying to prove we got on top

00:20:46.661 --> 00:20:47.833
and say, you know, this is pretty good.

00:20:47.833 --> 00:20:50.946
Let's maintain it,
let's not take any risk.

00:20:50.946 --> 00:20:53.028
We finished 2nd in the
country at Notre Dame.

00:20:53.028 --> 00:20:55.139
Everybody's calling me an idiot.

00:20:55.139 --> 00:20:56.947
Guy finishes last in medical school,

00:20:56.947 --> 00:20:58.365
they call him doctor.

00:20:58.365 --> 00:20:59.637
That doesn't seem fair.

00:20:59.637 --> 00:21:01.900
(audience laughs)

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.970
When I left Notre Dame, I
never thought I'd coach again.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:06.399
Where do you go from Notre Dame?

00:21:06.399 --> 00:21:08.261
According to my mother
you go directly to heaven,

00:21:08.261 --> 00:21:10.788
you sit by the Pope,
you don't coach anymore.

00:21:10.788 --> 00:21:12.055
(audience laughs)

00:21:12.055 --> 00:21:13.475
and then I went to live in a town

00:21:13.475 --> 00:21:15.732
where the average age was deceased.

00:21:15.732 --> 00:21:17.882
(audience laughs)

00:21:17.882 --> 00:21:20.169
And what I found out I
wasn't tired of coaching.

00:21:20.169 --> 00:21:21.613
You have to have something to hope for,

00:21:21.613 --> 00:21:24.227
something to dream and even though

00:21:24.227 --> 00:21:26.114
you've done great things so far,

00:21:26.114 --> 00:21:28.340
what's gonna happen now?

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.757
I want to give you a simple plan.

00:21:30.757 --> 00:21:33.783
Life doesn't have to be complicated.

00:21:33.783 --> 00:21:35.261
I try to keep life simple.

00:21:35.261 --> 00:21:36.743
Do you realize there are only

00:21:36.743 --> 00:21:38.724
seven colors of the rainbow?

00:21:38.724 --> 00:21:40.125
Only seven.

00:21:40.125 --> 00:21:45.047
Look what Michelangelo did
with those seven colors.

00:21:45.047 --> 00:21:47.936
There's only seven musical notes.

00:21:47.936 --> 00:21:51.625
Look what Beethoven did
with those seven notes.

00:21:51.625 --> 00:21:53.933
There's only ten numbers.

00:21:53.933 --> 00:21:56.724
Look what Bernie Madoff
did with those ten numbers.

00:21:56.724 --> 00:21:59.116
(audience laughs)

00:21:59.116 --> 00:22:03.433
The point I make is it doesn't
have to be complicated.

00:22:03.433 --> 00:22:06.686
So you need four things in your life.

00:22:06.686 --> 00:22:08.872
If you don't have any of these
four things in your life,

00:22:08.872 --> 00:22:11.308
you're going to have a tremendous void.

00:22:11.308 --> 00:22:14.778
See everybody needs something to do.

00:22:14.778 --> 00:22:17.879
Number two, everybody
needs someone to love.

00:22:17.879 --> 00:22:19.953
Number three, everybody
needs someone to believe in

00:22:19.953 --> 00:22:23.823
and in my case is Jesus
Christ, our Lord and Savior.

00:22:23.823 --> 00:22:25.905
But the fourth thing you need in your life

00:22:25.905 --> 00:22:29.024
is you need something to hope for.

00:22:29.024 --> 00:22:32.467
There's never a right
time to do the wrong thing

00:22:32.467 --> 00:22:36.451
and there's never a wrong
time to do the right thing.

00:22:36.451 --> 00:22:37.284
Just do what's right.

00:22:37.284 --> 00:22:40.473
And I think it's right to be
honest, right to be on time.

00:22:40.473 --> 00:22:42.915
See ladies and gentlemen
enjoy life, have fun.

00:22:42.915 --> 00:22:43.837
You're going to have problems,

00:22:43.837 --> 00:22:45.375
you're going to have difficulties.

00:22:45.375 --> 00:22:46.853
That's part of life.

00:22:46.853 --> 00:22:50.046
And don't tell people about your problems.

00:22:50.046 --> 00:22:53.205
Do you know that 90% of
the people don't care

00:22:53.205 --> 00:22:56.079
(audience laughs)

00:22:56.079 --> 00:22:58.729
and the other 10% are glad you got 'em,

00:22:58.729 --> 00:23:01.579
so you're better off
keeping it to yourself then.

00:23:01.579 --> 00:23:02.412
(audience laughs)

00:23:02.412 --> 00:23:03.918
You're gonna have problems,

00:23:03.918 --> 00:23:05.367
but have fun with what you're doing.

00:23:05.367 --> 00:23:07.548
People say did you have fun doing ESPN?

00:23:07.548 --> 00:23:10.916
Not really because if
you had fun being there,

00:23:10.916 --> 00:23:12.887
people had fun being around.

00:23:12.887 --> 00:23:15.078
Doesn't mean I don't do dumb things

00:23:15.078 --> 00:23:18.330
and sometimes I wasn't real honest.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.747
Do everything to the best of your ability

00:23:22.608 --> 00:23:24.843
with time allotted.

00:23:24.843 --> 00:23:26.520
You know, ladies and gentlemen,

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.119
not all of us be all-American,

00:23:28.119 --> 00:23:30.224
not everybody can be first place.

00:23:30.224 --> 00:23:34.890
Everybody can be the
best you're capable being

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:36.259
and I want to tell you
if you want to fail,

00:23:36.259 --> 00:23:37.804
you in the right to fail.

00:23:37.804 --> 00:23:39.335
That's what's great about this country.

00:23:39.335 --> 00:23:43.265
You do not have the right to
cause other people to fail

00:23:43.265 --> 00:23:45.334
because you don't do
everything that you're good in.

00:23:45.334 --> 00:23:47.051
When you join a spouse,

00:23:47.051 --> 00:23:49.076
you bring a child in the world.

00:23:49.076 --> 00:23:51.660
You join a business, you join a team,

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.588
you have obligations, responsibilities

00:23:53.588 --> 00:23:55.559
and you owe it to other people

00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:59.726
to do the maximum you can
in each everything you do.

00:24:00.611 --> 00:24:02.831
It's not complicated.

00:24:02.831 --> 00:24:06.714
And the last rule, you
show people you care

00:24:06.714 --> 00:24:08.172
and you walk in a room, your attitude,

00:24:08.172 --> 00:24:10.880
hey here I am, look at me, and thought no.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.312
Your attitude, there you
are, how can I help you?

00:24:13.312 --> 00:24:15.780
I wished I knew those
three rules when I was 21.

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:17.843
I've used them for the last 40 years.

00:24:17.843 --> 00:24:20.335
There's a statue of me at Notre Dame.

00:24:20.335 --> 00:24:23.018
I guess they need a place
for the pigeons to land, but

00:24:23.018 --> 00:24:24.101
(audience laughs)

00:24:24.101 --> 00:24:26.077
if you don't look at, just don't look up,

00:24:26.077 --> 00:24:28.137
look at three words on the pedestal,

00:24:28.137 --> 00:24:30.956
trust, commitment, love.

00:24:30.956 --> 00:24:33.373
(soft music)

00:24:38.908 --> 00:24:41.355
- I was flunking out of college.

00:24:41.355 --> 00:24:44.447
I had a 1.7 grade point average.

00:24:44.447 --> 00:24:45.988
I hope none of you can relate

00:24:45.988 --> 00:24:47.482
(laughs)

00:24:47.482 --> 00:24:50.397
at a 1.7 grade point average.

00:24:50.397 --> 00:24:52.392
I was sitting in my mother's beauty shop.

00:24:52.392 --> 00:24:53.685
They still call a beauty shop now?

00:24:53.685 --> 00:24:54.518
What they call it now?

00:24:54.518 --> 00:24:56.576
Yeah, I was sitting in the beauty parlor.

00:24:56.576 --> 00:24:59.253
I was sitting in my mother's beauty parlor

00:24:59.253 --> 00:25:01.164
and I'm looking in the mirror

00:25:01.164 --> 00:25:04.261
and I see behind me this
woman under the dryer

00:25:04.261 --> 00:25:05.902
and every time she looked up she,

00:25:05.902 --> 00:25:08.230
every time I looked up
she was looking at me,

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.452
just looking me in the eye.

00:25:09.452 --> 00:25:10.599
I didn't know who she was

00:25:10.599 --> 00:25:13.476
and I said, you know she
said somebody give me a pen,

00:25:13.476 --> 00:25:17.804
give me a pen, so I have
a prophecy, March 27 1975,

00:25:17.804 --> 00:25:21.150
she said boy you were
gonna travel the world

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:23.755
and speak to millions of people.

00:25:23.755 --> 00:25:26.202
Now mind you, I flunked out of college.

00:25:26.202 --> 00:25:27.600
I'm thinking about joining the army.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.763
I didn't know what I was gonna do

00:25:28.763 --> 00:25:31.698
and she's telling me I'm
gonna travel the world

00:25:31.698 --> 00:25:34.310
and speak to millions of people.

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:37.381
Well I have traveled the world

00:25:37.381 --> 00:25:40.681
and I have spoke to millions of people,

00:25:40.681 --> 00:25:42.279
but that's not the most important thing,

00:25:42.279 --> 00:25:43.151
the success that I had.

00:25:43.151 --> 00:25:45.312
The most important thing
is that what she taught me

00:25:45.312 --> 00:25:46.551
and what she told me that day

00:25:46.551 --> 00:25:49.321
has stayed with me since.

00:25:49.321 --> 00:25:51.034
I've been protected.

00:25:51.034 --> 00:25:52.745
I've been directed.

00:25:52.745 --> 00:25:54.377
I've been corrected.

00:25:54.377 --> 00:25:55.210
Fail big,

00:25:58.112 --> 00:26:01.695
that's right, fail big,
you only live once,

00:26:03.555 --> 00:26:06.555
So do what you feel passionate about

00:26:07.428 --> 00:26:08.428
take chances

00:26:09.341 --> 00:26:11.376
professionally.

00:26:11.376 --> 00:26:12.584
Don't be afraid to fail.

00:26:12.584 --> 00:26:16.066
There's an old IQ test was nine dots

00:26:16.066 --> 00:26:18.546
and you had to draw five lines

00:26:18.546 --> 00:26:21.534
with a pencil within these nine dots

00:26:21.534 --> 00:26:23.470
without lifting the pencil.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:27.404
The only way to do it was
to go outside the box.

00:26:27.404 --> 00:26:31.206
So don't be afraid to go outside the box.

00:26:31.206 --> 00:26:34.613
Don't be afraid to think outside the box.

00:26:34.613 --> 00:26:38.113
Don't be afraid to fail big, to dream big,

00:26:39.899 --> 00:26:40.899
but remember

00:26:42.181 --> 00:26:43.848
dreams without goals

00:26:46.514 --> 00:26:47.764
are just dreams

00:26:48.832 --> 00:26:52.165
and they ultimately fuel disappointment.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.250
So have dreams,

00:26:56.506 --> 00:26:59.923
but have goals, life goals, yearly goals,

00:27:01.464 --> 00:27:03.594
monthly goals, daily goals.

00:27:03.594 --> 00:27:06.677
I try to give myself a goal every day

00:27:07.565 --> 00:27:08.732
and understand

00:27:09.797 --> 00:27:12.109
that to achieve these goals,

00:27:12.109 --> 00:27:14.192
you must apply discipline

00:27:15.247 --> 00:27:16.580
and consistency.

00:27:17.613 --> 00:27:19.457
You have to work at it

00:27:19.457 --> 00:27:20.290
every day.

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:21.953
You have to plan

00:27:21.953 --> 00:27:22.786
every day.

00:27:22.786 --> 00:27:25.882
You've heard the saying
we don't plan to fail,

00:27:25.882 --> 00:27:27.215
we fail to plan,

00:27:28.454 --> 00:27:29.787
hard work works.

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:36.950
Working really hard is
what successful people do

00:27:38.542 --> 00:27:41.542
and in this text, tweet, twerk world

00:27:43.271 --> 00:27:45.271
that you've grown up in,

00:27:46.286 --> 00:27:50.036
remember just because
you're doing a lot more

00:27:51.587 --> 00:27:55.707
doesn't mean you're
getting a lot more done.

00:27:55.707 --> 00:27:59.746
Remember that, just because
you're doing a lot more,

00:27:59.746 --> 00:28:03.413
doesn't mean you're
getting a lot more done.

00:28:04.773 --> 00:28:07.856
Don't confuse movement with progress.

00:28:12.018 --> 00:28:12.851
My mother told me, she said,

00:28:12.851 --> 00:28:14.482
yeah 'cause you've been
running in place all the time

00:28:14.482 --> 00:28:16.589
and never get anywhere.

00:28:16.589 --> 00:28:18.774
So continue to strive,
continue to have goals,

00:28:18.774 --> 00:28:22.774
continue to progress and
anything you want good,

00:28:25.655 --> 00:28:26.738
you can have,

00:28:28.066 --> 00:28:29.066
so claim it.

00:28:29.928 --> 00:28:32.108
Work hard to get it.

00:28:32.108 --> 00:28:36.824
When you get it, reach
back, pull someone else up,

00:28:36.824 --> 00:28:38.491
each one, teach one.

00:28:40.802 --> 00:28:43.719
Don't just aspire to make a living,

00:28:47.027 --> 00:28:49.360
aspire to make a difference.

00:28:51.747 --> 00:28:54.330
(upbeat music)

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.230
- I was 18 years old when I got married.

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:04.599
I belonged to a very conservative
family, a Baloch family.

00:29:04.599 --> 00:29:09.131
Where good daughters never
say no to their parents.

00:29:09.131 --> 00:29:11.426
My father wanted me to get married

00:29:11.426 --> 00:29:13.393
and all I said was, if
that makes you happy,

00:29:13.393 --> 00:29:16.350
I'll say yes and of course,

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:18.850
it was never a happy marriage.

00:29:20.277 --> 00:29:24.154
Just about after two
years of getting married,

00:29:24.154 --> 00:29:28.443
about nine years ago,
I'm in a car accident.

00:29:28.443 --> 00:29:30.613
(soft music)

00:29:30.613 --> 00:29:33.113
Somehow my husband fell asleep

00:29:34.594 --> 00:29:37.094
and the car fell in the ditch.

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:41.127
He managed to jump out, saved himself,

00:29:41.127 --> 00:29:44.960
I'm happy for him, but
I stayed inside the car

00:29:46.997 --> 00:29:48.880
and I sustained a lot of injuries,

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.527
list is a bit long.

00:29:50.527 --> 00:29:52.930
The radius ulna of my
right arm were fractured,

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:54.207
the wrist was fractured,

00:29:54.207 --> 00:29:56.367
shoulder bone and
collarbone were fractured,

00:29:56.367 --> 00:29:58.223
my whole ribcage got fractured,

00:29:58.223 --> 00:29:59.745
but that injury that changed me

00:29:59.745 --> 00:30:03.512
and my life completely
was the spine injury.

00:30:03.512 --> 00:30:05.508
Many people came to rescue.

00:30:05.508 --> 00:30:08.898
They gave me CPR, they
dragged me out of the car

00:30:08.898 --> 00:30:11.248
and while they were dragging me out,

00:30:11.248 --> 00:30:14.325
I got the complete
transection of my spinal cord.

00:30:14.325 --> 00:30:17.634
Those two and a half months
in the hospital were dreadful.

00:30:17.634 --> 00:30:20.889
I was at the verge of despair.

00:30:20.889 --> 00:30:22.782
One day doctor came to me and he said,

00:30:22.782 --> 00:30:25.027
well I heard that you
wanted to be an artist,

00:30:25.027 --> 00:30:26.784
but you ended up being a housewife.

00:30:26.784 --> 00:30:29.247
I have a bad news for you,

00:30:29.247 --> 00:30:31.623
you won't be able to paint again.

00:30:31.623 --> 00:30:34.491
Next day doctor came to me and said,

00:30:34.491 --> 00:30:37.494
your spine injury is so bad,

00:30:37.494 --> 00:30:39.854
you won't be able to walk again.

00:30:39.854 --> 00:30:42.407
I took a deep breath
and I said it's alright.

00:30:42.407 --> 00:30:44.422
Next day doctor came to me and said,

00:30:44.422 --> 00:30:45.764
because of your spine injury

00:30:45.764 --> 00:30:48.646
and the fixation that
you have in your back,

00:30:48.646 --> 00:30:51.304
you won't be able to give
birth to a child again.

00:30:51.304 --> 00:30:53.252
That day I was devastated.

00:30:53.252 --> 00:30:55.304
I started to question my existence.

00:30:55.304 --> 00:30:56.971
Why am I even alive?

00:30:58.093 --> 00:31:01.070
So what kept me going was one day

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:04.562
I asked my brothers, I know
I have a deformed hand,

00:31:04.562 --> 00:31:07.099
but I'm tired of looking
at these white walls

00:31:07.099 --> 00:31:09.827
in the hospital and
wearing these white scrubs.

00:31:09.827 --> 00:31:12.463
Bring me some colors,
bring me some small canvas.

00:31:12.463 --> 00:31:13.796
I want to paint.

00:31:14.777 --> 00:31:18.944
So the very first painting
I made was on my deathbed.

00:31:19.798 --> 00:31:22.293
Where I painted for the very first time.

00:31:22.293 --> 00:31:23.734
What an amazing therapy it was,

00:31:23.734 --> 00:31:25.476
without uttering a single word,

00:31:25.476 --> 00:31:27.968
I could paint my heart out.

00:31:27.968 --> 00:31:30.696
I could share my story.

00:31:30.696 --> 00:31:31.797
People used to come and say,

00:31:31.797 --> 00:31:35.052
what lovely painting, so much color.

00:31:35.052 --> 00:31:37.384
Nobody could see the grief in it,

00:31:37.384 --> 00:31:40.301
only I could and that day I decided

00:31:41.147 --> 00:31:43.572
that I'm going to live life for myself.

00:31:43.572 --> 00:31:47.681
I am going to be that
perfect person for someone.

00:31:47.681 --> 00:31:49.415
I am just going to take this moment

00:31:49.415 --> 00:31:51.604
and I will make it perfect for myself,

00:31:51.604 --> 00:31:53.594
that I'm going to fight my fears.

00:31:53.594 --> 00:31:57.698
So I wrote down, one
by one, all those fears

00:31:57.698 --> 00:31:59.760
and I decided that I'm going
to overcome these fears

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.401
one at a time.

00:32:01.401 --> 00:32:03.444
You know what was my biggest fear?

00:32:03.444 --> 00:32:04.824
Divorce.

00:32:04.824 --> 00:32:08.630
But the day I decided that
this is nothing but my fear.

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:12.290
I liberated myself by setting him free

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:15.242
and I made myself emotionally so strong

00:32:15.242 --> 00:32:17.477
that the day I got the news
that he is getting married,

00:32:17.477 --> 00:32:20.701
I sent him a text that
I'm so happy for you

00:32:20.701 --> 00:32:22.625
and I wish you all the best

00:32:22.625 --> 00:32:26.071
and he knows that I pray for him today.

00:32:26.071 --> 00:32:30.238
Number two was I won't be
able to be a mother again

00:32:31.119 --> 00:32:34.480
and that was quite devastating for me,

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.406
but then I realized there are
so many children in the world,

00:32:37.406 --> 00:32:40.164
all they want is acceptance,

00:32:40.164 --> 00:32:41.576
so there is no point of crying,

00:32:41.576 --> 00:32:45.154
just go and adopt one
and that's what I did.

00:32:45.154 --> 00:32:49.321
(audience applauding and cheering)

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.036
I gave my name in different organizations,

00:32:53.036 --> 00:32:55.091
different orphanages

00:32:55.091 --> 00:32:57.077
and I waited patiently.

00:32:57.077 --> 00:32:58.646
Two years later I got this call

00:32:58.646 --> 00:33:00.828
from a very small city in Pakistan.

00:33:00.828 --> 00:33:03.210
I got a call and they said,
are you Muniba Mazari,

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:06.277
there is a baby boy and
would you like to adopt?

00:33:06.277 --> 00:33:08.191
I could literally feel the labor pains.

00:33:08.191 --> 00:33:10.787
Yes, yes, I am going to adopt him.

00:33:10.787 --> 00:33:13.204
I am coming to take him home

00:33:14.744 --> 00:33:18.017
and that day Nael was two days old

00:33:18.017 --> 00:33:19.600
and today he's six.

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:24.745
You know when you end up
being on the wheelchair,

00:33:24.745 --> 00:33:26.777
what's the most painful thing?

00:33:26.777 --> 00:33:29.171
People think that they
will not be accepted

00:33:29.171 --> 00:33:31.244
by the people because we,

00:33:31.244 --> 00:33:33.537
in the world of perfect
people, are imperfect.

00:33:33.537 --> 00:33:36.629
So I decided to appear more in public.

00:33:36.629 --> 00:33:38.232
I started to paint.

00:33:38.232 --> 00:33:40.521
I have done a lot of modeling campaigns.

00:33:40.521 --> 00:33:41.867
I decided that I'm going to join

00:33:41.867 --> 00:33:44.578
the national TV of Pakistan
as an anchorperson.

00:33:44.578 --> 00:33:46.463
I became the National Goodwill Ambassador

00:33:46.463 --> 00:33:48.796
for UN Women Pakistan and now I speak

00:33:48.796 --> 00:33:51.118
for the rights of women, children.

00:33:51.118 --> 00:33:54.970
I was featured in BBC 100 Women for 2015.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:58.553
I'm one of the Forbes
30 under 30 for 2016.

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:03.406
So when you accept
yourself the way you are,

00:34:03.406 --> 00:34:05.785
the world recognizes you.

00:34:05.785 --> 00:34:08.641
It all starts from within.

00:34:08.641 --> 00:34:11.974
We have this amazing fantasy about life.

00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:14.647
This is how things should work.

00:34:14.647 --> 00:34:18.586
This is my plan it
should go as per my plan.

00:34:18.586 --> 00:34:22.066
If that doesn't happen, we give up.

00:34:22.066 --> 00:34:24.703
I never wanted to be on the wheelchair,

00:34:24.703 --> 00:34:28.310
never thought of being on the wheelchair.

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:30.504
This life is a test and a trial

00:34:30.504 --> 00:34:32.762
and tests are never supposed to be easy,

00:34:32.762 --> 00:34:35.391
so when you're expecting ease from life

00:34:35.391 --> 00:34:36.904
and life gives you lemons,

00:34:36.904 --> 00:34:38.039
then you make the lemonade

00:34:38.039 --> 00:34:40.555
and then do not blame life for that.

00:34:40.555 --> 00:34:43.007
It is okay to be scared.

00:34:43.007 --> 00:34:44.507
It is okay to cry.

00:34:46.193 --> 00:34:47.842
Everything is okay, but giving up

00:34:47.842 --> 00:34:49.842
should not be an option.

00:34:50.794 --> 00:34:53.871
They always say that
failure is not an option.

00:34:53.871 --> 00:34:57.431
Failure should be an option
because when you fail,

00:34:57.431 --> 00:34:59.681
you get up and then you
fail and then you get up

00:34:59.681 --> 00:35:01.811
and that keeps you going.

00:35:01.811 --> 00:35:04.270
Embrace each and every
breath that you are taking,

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:06.936
celebrate your life, live it,

00:35:06.936 --> 00:35:09.508
don't die before your death.

00:35:09.508 --> 00:35:12.258
Real happiness lies in gratitude,

00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:17.750
so be grateful, be alive
and live every moment.

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:20.167
(soft music)

00:35:24.994 --> 00:35:27.072
- If you want to change the world

00:35:27.072 --> 00:35:29.843
start off by making your bed.

00:35:29.843 --> 00:35:32.044
If you made your bed every morning

00:35:32.044 --> 00:35:35.603
you will have accomplished
the first task of the day.

00:35:35.603 --> 00:35:38.102
It will give you a small sense of pride

00:35:38.102 --> 00:35:40.412
and it will encourage
you to do another task

00:35:40.412 --> 00:35:42.941
and another and another

00:35:42.941 --> 00:35:45.411
and by the end of the day
that one task completed

00:35:45.411 --> 00:35:47.592
will have turned into
many tasks completed.

00:35:47.592 --> 00:35:50.697
Making your bed will
also reinforce the fact

00:35:50.697 --> 00:35:52.937
that the little things in life matter.

00:35:52.937 --> 00:35:55.367
If you can't do the little things right,

00:35:55.367 --> 00:35:58.149
you'll never be able to
do the big things right

00:35:58.149 --> 00:36:00.692
and if by chance you have a miserable day,

00:36:00.692 --> 00:36:04.692
you will come home to a bed that is made,

00:36:04.692 --> 00:36:08.668
that you made and a made
bed gives you encouragement

00:36:08.668 --> 00:36:10.631
that tomorrow will be better.

00:36:10.631 --> 00:36:12.804
To pass SEAL training there
are series of long swims

00:36:12.804 --> 00:36:14.301
that must be completed.

00:36:14.301 --> 00:36:16.346
One is the night swim,

00:36:16.346 --> 00:36:18.041
before the swim the instructors joyfully

00:36:18.041 --> 00:36:22.518
brief the students on
all the species of sharks

00:36:22.518 --> 00:36:25.505
that inhabit the waters off San Clemente.

00:36:25.505 --> 00:36:27.629
They assure you, however,

00:36:27.629 --> 00:36:32.231
that no student has ever
been eaten by a shark,

00:36:32.231 --> 00:36:34.955
at least not that they can remember.

00:36:34.955 --> 00:36:36.895
But you are also taught

00:36:36.895 --> 00:36:40.044
that if a shark begins
to circle your position,

00:36:40.044 --> 00:36:43.690
stand your ground, do not swim away,

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:47.167
do not act afraid and if the shark

00:36:47.167 --> 00:36:49.929
hungry for a midnight
snack darts towards you,

00:36:49.929 --> 00:36:52.233
then summons up all your strength

00:36:52.233 --> 00:36:54.183
and punch him in the snout

00:36:54.183 --> 00:36:57.059
and he will turn and swim away.

00:36:57.059 --> 00:36:59.353
There are a lot of sharks in the world.

00:36:59.353 --> 00:37:01.647
If you hope to complete the swim,

00:37:01.647 --> 00:37:03.991
you will have to deal with them.

00:37:03.991 --> 00:37:06.746
So if you want to change the world,

00:37:06.746 --> 00:37:09.227
don't back down from the sharks.

00:37:09.227 --> 00:37:11.239
Over a few weeks of difficult training,

00:37:11.239 --> 00:37:14.532
my SEAL class, which started with 150 men

00:37:14.532 --> 00:37:16.692
was down to just 42.

00:37:16.692 --> 00:37:19.965
There are now six boat
crews of seven men each.

00:37:19.965 --> 00:37:22.459
I was in the boat with the tall guys,

00:37:22.459 --> 00:37:26.323
but the best boat crew we had
was made up of little guys,

00:37:26.323 --> 00:37:28.408
the Munchkin crew, we called 'em.

00:37:28.408 --> 00:37:31.238
No one was over five foot five.

00:37:31.238 --> 00:37:34.529
The Munchkin boat crew
had one American Indian,

00:37:34.529 --> 00:37:36.893
one African American, one Polish American,

00:37:36.893 --> 00:37:38.556
one Greek American, one Italian American,

00:37:38.556 --> 00:37:41.274
and two tough kids from the Midwest.

00:37:41.274 --> 00:37:44.692
They out paddled, out ran, and out swam

00:37:44.692 --> 00:37:46.219
all the other boat crews.

00:37:46.219 --> 00:37:48.431
The big men and the other boat crews

00:37:48.431 --> 00:37:51.079
will always make good-natured fun

00:37:51.079 --> 00:37:53.836
of the tiny little flippers,

00:37:53.836 --> 00:37:56.729
the Munchkins put on
their tiny little feet

00:37:56.729 --> 00:38:00.777
prior to every swim, but
somehow these little guys

00:38:00.777 --> 00:38:02.944
from every corner of
the nation in the world

00:38:02.944 --> 00:38:04.675
always have the last laugh.

00:38:04.675 --> 00:38:05.890
sailing faster than everyone

00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:09.086
and reaching the shore
long before the rest of us.

00:38:09.086 --> 00:38:11.559
SEAL training was a great equalizer.

00:38:11.559 --> 00:38:14.602
Nothing mattered, but
your will to succeed,

00:38:14.602 --> 00:38:16.195
not your color, not
your ethnic background,

00:38:16.195 --> 00:38:19.081
not your education,
not your social status.

00:38:19.081 --> 00:38:21.216
If you want to change the world

00:38:21.216 --> 00:38:23.899
measure a person by the
size of their heart,

00:38:23.899 --> 00:38:26.082
not by the size of their flippers.

00:38:26.082 --> 00:38:29.525
The ninth week of training
is referred to as hell week.

00:38:29.525 --> 00:38:31.551
It is six days of no sleep,

00:38:31.551 --> 00:38:33.748
constant physical and mental harassment

00:38:33.748 --> 00:38:37.566
and one special day at the mud flats.

00:38:37.566 --> 00:38:38.399
The mud flats are an area

00:38:38.399 --> 00:38:39.912
between San Diego and Tijuana

00:38:39.912 --> 00:38:41.747
where the rough water runs off

00:38:41.747 --> 00:38:44.075
and creates the Tijuana sloughs,

00:38:44.075 --> 00:38:47.820
a swampy patch of terrain
where the mud will engulf you.

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.709
It is on Wednesday of hell week

00:38:49.709 --> 00:38:50.951
that you paddle down in the mud flats

00:38:50.951 --> 00:38:53.070
and spend the next 15
hours trying to survive

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:56.354
this freezing cold, the howling wind

00:38:56.354 --> 00:39:00.055
and the incessant pressure
to quit from the instructors.

00:39:00.055 --> 00:39:03.040
As the Sun began to set
that Wednesday evening,

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.450
my training class having committed

00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:07.846
some egregious infraction of the rules

00:39:07.846 --> 00:39:10.058
was ordered into the mud.

00:39:10.058 --> 00:39:11.620
The mud consumed each man til

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:15.347
there was nothing visible but our heads.

00:39:15.347 --> 00:39:17.801
The instructors told us
we could leave the mud,

00:39:17.801 --> 00:39:20.688
if only five men would
quit, only five men,

00:39:20.688 --> 00:39:25.328
just five men and we could get
out of the oppressive cold.

00:39:25.328 --> 00:39:26.679
Looking around the mud
flat, it was apparent

00:39:26.679 --> 00:39:29.513
that some students were about to give up.

00:39:29.513 --> 00:39:31.848
It was still over eight
hours til the sun came up,

00:39:31.848 --> 00:39:35.098
eight more hours of bone-chilling cold,

00:39:36.178 --> 00:39:37.635
of chattering teeth, and shivering moans

00:39:37.635 --> 00:39:39.799
of the trainees were so loud,

00:39:39.799 --> 00:39:42.395
it was hard to hear anything

00:39:42.395 --> 00:39:47.015
and then one voice began
to echo through the night.

00:39:47.015 --> 00:39:49.098
One voice raised in song,

00:39:50.036 --> 00:39:52.946
the song was terribly out of tune,

00:39:52.946 --> 00:39:55.569
but sung with great enthusiasm.

00:39:55.569 --> 00:39:58.191
One voice became two and two became three

00:39:58.191 --> 00:40:01.314
and before long, everyone
in the class was singing.

00:40:01.314 --> 00:40:03.655
The instructors threatened
us with more time in the mud

00:40:03.655 --> 00:40:06.828
if we kept up the singing,
but the singing persisted

00:40:06.828 --> 00:40:10.136
and somehow the mud seemed a little warmer

00:40:10.136 --> 00:40:14.601
and the wind a little tamer
and the dawn not so far away.

00:40:14.601 --> 00:40:18.740
If I have learned anything in
my time traveling the world,

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:22.188
it is the power of hope,
the power of one person,

00:40:22.188 --> 00:40:25.717
a Washington, a Lincoln, King, Mandela,

00:40:25.717 --> 00:40:28.276
and even a young girl
from Pakistan, Malala.

00:40:28.276 --> 00:40:30.935
One person can change the world

00:40:30.935 --> 00:40:32.556
by giving people hope.

00:40:32.556 --> 00:40:35.102
So if you want to change the world,

00:40:35.102 --> 00:40:37.778
start each day with a task completed.

00:40:37.778 --> 00:40:39.414
Find someone to help you through life.

00:40:39.414 --> 00:40:41.374
Respect everyone.

00:40:41.374 --> 00:40:42.476
Know the life is not fair

00:40:42.476 --> 00:40:44.351
and that you will fail often,

00:40:44.351 --> 00:40:46.209
but if you take some risks,

00:40:46.209 --> 00:40:48.449
step up when the times are the toughest,

00:40:48.449 --> 00:40:50.525
face down the bullies,
lift up the downtrodden,

00:40:50.525 --> 00:40:52.486
and never ever give up.

00:40:52.486 --> 00:40:56.048
If you do these things,
the next generation

00:40:56.048 --> 00:40:57.723
and the generations that follow

00:40:57.723 --> 00:40:59.263
will live in a world far better

00:40:59.263 --> 00:41:00.978
than the one we have today

00:41:00.978 --> 00:41:03.525
and what started here will indeed,

00:41:03.525 --> 00:41:06.692
have changed the world for the better.

00:41:07.852 --> 00:41:10.269
(soft music)

00:41:14.263 --> 00:41:17.251
- The wisest person I ever met in my life,

00:41:17.251 --> 00:41:19.084
a third-grade dropout.

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:22.081
Wisest and drop out in the same sentence

00:41:22.081 --> 00:41:25.322
is rather oxymoronic, like jumbo shrimp.

00:41:25.322 --> 00:41:27.220
(audience laughs)

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:28.119
Mm-hmm.

00:41:28.119 --> 00:41:29.966
(audience laughs)

00:41:29.966 --> 00:41:32.560
Like fun run, ain't nothing fun about it.

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.752
(audience laughs)

00:41:34.752 --> 00:41:37.389
Like Microsoft Works, y'all don't hear me.

00:41:37.389 --> 00:41:39.878
(audience laughs)

00:41:39.878 --> 00:41:41.520
I used to say like country music,

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.773
but I've lived in Texas so long,

00:41:43.773 --> 00:41:47.946
I love country music
now, I, in fact, yeah,

00:41:47.946 --> 00:41:51.579
I hunt, I fish, I have
cowboy boots and cowboy,

00:41:51.579 --> 00:41:52.944
y'all I'm a black neck redneck.

00:41:52.944 --> 00:41:54.277
Do you hear what I'm saying to you?

00:41:54.277 --> 00:41:56.880
(audience laughs)

00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.107
No longer oxymoronic for
me to say country music

00:42:00.107 --> 00:42:01.677
and it's not oxymoronic for me

00:42:01.677 --> 00:42:04.094
to say third grade and drop out.

00:42:04.094 --> 00:42:06.425
That third grade dropout,
the wisest person

00:42:06.425 --> 00:42:08.720
I ever met in my life, who taught me

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:11.622
to combine knowledge and wisdom

00:42:11.622 --> 00:42:15.622
to make an impact, was
my father, a simple cook.

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:19.101
Wisest man I ever met in my life.

00:42:19.101 --> 00:42:20.644
Just a simple cook.

00:42:20.644 --> 00:42:21.995
Left school in the third grade

00:42:21.995 --> 00:42:23.215
to help out on the family farm,

00:42:23.215 --> 00:42:24.691
but just because he left school

00:42:24.691 --> 00:42:26.791
doesn't mean a his education stopped.

00:42:26.791 --> 00:42:27.624
Mark Twain once said,

00:42:27.624 --> 00:42:28.843
"I've never allowed my schooling

00:42:28.843 --> 00:42:30.964
"to get in the way of my education."

00:42:30.964 --> 00:42:32.462
My father taught himself how to read,

00:42:32.462 --> 00:42:33.863
taught himself how to write,

00:42:33.863 --> 00:42:36.295
decided in the midst of Jim Crow-ism

00:42:36.295 --> 00:42:39.480
as America was breeding the
last gasp of the Civil War,

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.526
my father decided he was
going to stand and be a man.

00:42:42.526 --> 00:42:44.919
Not a black man, not a brown man,

00:42:44.919 --> 00:42:47.169
not a white man, but a man.

00:42:48.218 --> 00:42:51.518
He literally challenged
himself to be the best

00:42:51.518 --> 00:42:54.768
that he could all the days of his life.

00:42:55.656 --> 00:42:57.498
I have four degrees.

00:42:57.498 --> 00:42:59.511
My brother is a judge.

00:42:59.511 --> 00:43:02.140
We're not the smartest ones in our family.

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:04.281
It's a third grade dropout daddy.

00:43:04.281 --> 00:43:06.001
A third grade dropout daddy

00:43:06.001 --> 00:43:08.038
who was quoting Michelangelo saying to us,

00:43:08.038 --> 00:43:11.045
boys, I won't have a problem
if you aim high and miss,

00:43:11.045 --> 00:43:12.176
but I'm gonna have a real issue

00:43:12.176 --> 00:43:14.683
if you aim low and hit.

00:43:14.683 --> 00:43:17.269
A country mother quoting
Henry Ford saying,

00:43:17.269 --> 00:43:18.299
if you think you can

00:43:18.299 --> 00:43:20.774
or if you think you can't, you're right.

00:43:20.774 --> 00:43:23.958
I learned that from a third
grade drop, simple lessons.

00:43:23.958 --> 00:43:25.076
Lessons like these,

00:43:25.076 --> 00:43:28.094
son you'd rather be an hour
early than a minute late.

00:43:28.094 --> 00:43:29.636
We never knew what time it was at my house

00:43:29.636 --> 00:43:31.558
'cause the clocks were always ahead.

00:43:31.558 --> 00:43:33.110
My mother said for nearly 30 years

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:35.869
my father left the house
at 3:45 in the morning.

00:43:35.869 --> 00:43:37.462
One day she asked him, why daddy?

00:43:37.462 --> 00:43:39.205
He said maybe one of my boys

00:43:39.205 --> 00:43:40.563
will catch me in the act of excellence.

00:43:40.563 --> 00:43:42.282
I want to share two things with you.

00:43:42.282 --> 00:43:44.949
Aristotle said you are
what you repeatedly do,

00:43:44.949 --> 00:43:48.480
therefore excellence ought
to be a habit, not an act.

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.974
Don't ever forget that.

00:43:49.974 --> 00:43:52.725
I know you're tough but
always remember to be kind,

00:43:52.725 --> 00:43:55.152
always don't ever forget that.

00:43:55.152 --> 00:43:57.569
Never embarrass mama, mm-hmm,

00:43:59.422 --> 00:44:02.765
yeah, if mama ain't
happy ain't nobody happy.

00:44:02.765 --> 00:44:04.457
If daddy ain't happy, don't nobody care,

00:44:04.457 --> 00:44:07.442
but you know, what can I tell you?

00:44:07.442 --> 00:44:10.025
Next lesson, lesson from a cook

00:44:11.029 --> 00:44:13.332
over there in the galley, son,

00:44:13.332 --> 00:44:16.183
make sure your servants towel
is bigger than your ego.

00:44:16.183 --> 00:44:20.350
Ego is the anesthesia that
deadens the pain of stupidity.

00:44:21.241 --> 00:44:22.901
Y'all might have a relative in mind,

00:44:22.901 --> 00:44:24.938
you wanna send that to,
let me say it again.

00:44:24.938 --> 00:44:26.634
(audience laughs)

00:44:26.634 --> 00:44:29.329
Ego is the anesthesia that
deadens the pain of stupidity.

00:44:29.329 --> 00:44:30.925
Pride is the burden of a foolish person.

00:44:30.925 --> 00:44:34.405
John Wooden coached basketball
at UCLA for a living,

00:44:34.405 --> 00:44:36.921
but his calling was to impact people

00:44:36.921 --> 00:44:38.802
and with all those national championships,

00:44:38.802 --> 00:44:41.400
guess what he was found doing
in the middle of the week?

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.930
Going into the cupboard, grabbing a broom

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:46.791
and sweeping his own gym floor.

00:44:46.791 --> 00:44:49.728
You want to make an
impact, find your broom.

00:44:49.728 --> 00:44:52.871
Every day of your life,
you find your broom.

00:44:52.871 --> 00:44:55.242
You grow your influence that way.

00:44:55.242 --> 00:44:56.845
That way you're attracting people,

00:44:56.845 --> 00:44:58.878
so that you can impact them.

00:44:58.878 --> 00:45:00.595
Final lesson.

00:45:00.595 --> 00:45:01.436
Son

00:45:01.436 --> 00:45:03.481
(gentle music)

00:45:03.481 --> 00:45:06.648
if you're gonna do a job, do it right.

00:45:07.871 --> 00:45:11.454
I've always been told
how average I can be,

00:45:13.715 --> 00:45:17.372
always been criticized
about being average,

00:45:17.372 --> 00:45:19.061
but I want to tell you something.

00:45:19.061 --> 00:45:22.254
I stand here before you,
before all of these people

00:45:22.254 --> 00:45:25.151
not listening to those words,

00:45:25.151 --> 00:45:29.884
but telling myself every single
day to shoot for the stars,

00:45:29.884 --> 00:45:31.924
to be the best that I can be.

00:45:31.924 --> 00:45:34.484
Good enough isn't good
enough if it can be better

00:45:34.484 --> 00:45:37.336
and better isn't good
enough if it can be best.

00:45:37.336 --> 00:45:39.905
Let me close with a very personal story

00:45:39.905 --> 00:45:42.582
that I think will bring
all this into focus.

00:45:42.582 --> 00:45:45.799
Wisdom will come to you in
the unlikeliest of sources.

00:45:45.799 --> 00:45:47.636
A lot of times through failure.

00:45:47.636 --> 00:45:49.849
When you hit rock-bottom, remember this,

00:45:49.849 --> 00:45:52.099
while you're struggling rock-bottom

00:45:52.099 --> 00:45:53.680
can also be a great foundation

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.475
on which to build and on which to grow.

00:45:56.475 --> 00:45:59.341
I'm not worried that you'll be successful.

00:45:59.341 --> 00:46:03.093
I'm worried that you won't
fail from time to time.

00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:07.067
The person that gets up off
the canvas and keeps growing,

00:46:07.067 --> 00:46:07.900
that's the person

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.638
that will continue to
grow their influence.

00:46:10.638 --> 00:46:14.786
Back in the '70s to
help me make this point,

00:46:14.786 --> 00:46:16.776
let me introduce you to someone.

00:46:16.776 --> 00:46:20.056
I met the finest woman
I'd ever met in my life.

00:46:20.056 --> 00:46:24.936
mm-hmm, back in my day we'd
called her a brick house.

00:46:24.936 --> 00:46:27.769
(audience laughs)

00:46:28.817 --> 00:46:30.016
This woman was the finest woman

00:46:30.016 --> 00:46:31.017
I'd ever seen in my life,

00:46:31.017 --> 00:46:32.411
there's just one little problem.

00:46:32.411 --> 00:46:35.639
Back then ladies didn't
like big old linemen.

00:46:35.639 --> 00:46:37.462
The Blind Side hadn't come out yet.

00:46:37.462 --> 00:46:39.379
(audience laughs)

00:46:39.379 --> 00:46:41.370
They like quarterbacks and running backs.

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:42.306
We're at this dance

00:46:42.306 --> 00:46:43.903
and I find out her name is Trina Williams

00:46:43.903 --> 00:46:47.351
from Lompoc, California
and we were all dancing

00:46:47.351 --> 00:46:49.494
and we're just just excited

00:46:49.494 --> 00:46:51.691
and I decide in the
middle of dancing with her

00:46:51.691 --> 00:46:53.832
that I would ask her for a phone number.

00:46:53.832 --> 00:46:55.159
Trina was the first one,

00:46:55.159 --> 00:46:56.905
Trina was the only woman in college

00:46:56.905 --> 00:46:58.514
who gave me her real telephone number.

00:46:58.514 --> 00:47:00.157
(audience laughs)

00:47:00.157 --> 00:47:04.012
The next day, we walked to
Baskin Robbins Ice Cream Parlor.

00:47:04.012 --> 00:47:05.531
My friends couldn't believe it.

00:47:05.531 --> 00:47:07.814
This has been 40 years ago

00:47:07.814 --> 00:47:10.208
and my friends still can't believe it.

00:47:10.208 --> 00:47:14.093
We go on a second date and a third date

00:47:14.093 --> 00:47:16.171
and a fourth date.

00:47:16.171 --> 00:47:17.223
Mm-hmm.

00:47:17.223 --> 00:47:18.436
(audience laughs)

00:47:18.436 --> 00:47:20.979
We drive from Chico to Vallejo

00:47:20.979 --> 00:47:22.828
so that she could meet my parents.

00:47:22.828 --> 00:47:26.058
My father meets her, my daddy, my hero.

00:47:26.058 --> 00:47:28.066
He meets her, pulls me
to the side and says,

00:47:28.066 --> 00:47:29.289
"Is she psycho?"

00:47:29.289 --> 00:47:32.596
But anyway, we go together for a year,

00:47:32.596 --> 00:47:34.094
two years, three years, four years

00:47:34.094 --> 00:47:36.377
by now Trina's a senior in college.

00:47:36.377 --> 00:47:38.503
I'm still a freshman, but
I'm working some things out.

00:47:38.503 --> 00:47:40.831
(audience laughs)

00:47:40.831 --> 00:47:43.163
I'm so glad I graduated in four terms,

00:47:43.163 --> 00:47:45.496
Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan,

00:47:47.828 --> 00:47:49.729
so now it's time to propose,

00:47:49.729 --> 00:47:51.343
so I talked to her girlfriends

00:47:51.343 --> 00:47:53.313
and it's California, it's in the '70s,

00:47:53.313 --> 00:47:55.724
so it has to be outside,
have to have a candle

00:47:55.724 --> 00:47:57.984
and have to have some chocolate.

00:47:57.984 --> 00:47:59.000
Listen, I'm from the hood,

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.777
I had a bottle of Boone's Farm wine,

00:48:00.777 --> 00:48:02.705
that's what I had.

00:48:02.705 --> 00:48:05.288
She said yes, that was the key.

00:48:06.698 --> 00:48:07.887
I married the most beautiful woman

00:48:07.887 --> 00:48:08.747
I've ever seen in my,

00:48:08.747 --> 00:48:10.114
y'all ever been to a wedding

00:48:10.114 --> 00:48:12.643
and even before the wedding
starts you hear this,

00:48:12.643 --> 00:48:14.406
How in the world?

00:48:14.406 --> 00:48:17.604
(audience laughs)

00:48:17.604 --> 00:48:20.216
And it was coming from
my side of the family.

00:48:20.216 --> 00:48:23.049
(audience laughs)

00:48:25.246 --> 00:48:27.738
We get married, we have a few children.

00:48:27.738 --> 00:48:29.944
Our lives are great.

00:48:29.944 --> 00:48:33.339
One day, Trina finds a
lump in her left breast.

00:48:33.339 --> 00:48:35.145
Breast cancer.

00:48:35.145 --> 00:48:37.785
Six years after that diagnosis,

00:48:37.785 --> 00:48:42.313
me and my two little boys
walked up to mommy's casket

00:48:42.313 --> 00:48:44.969
and for two years my heart didn't beat.

00:48:44.969 --> 00:48:46.452
If it wasn't for my faith in God,

00:48:46.452 --> 00:48:48.579
I wouldn't be standing here today.

00:48:48.579 --> 00:48:50.881
If it wasn't for those two little boys,

00:48:50.881 --> 00:48:54.622
there'd have been no
reason for which to go on.

00:48:54.622 --> 00:48:56.455
I was completely lost.

00:48:58.044 --> 00:48:59.794
That was rock bottom.

00:49:01.007 --> 00:49:03.054
You know what sustained me?

00:49:03.054 --> 00:49:05.708
The wisdom of a third grade dropout.

00:49:05.708 --> 00:49:08.041
The wisdom of a simple cook.

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:12.617
We're at the casket, I'd
never seen my dad cry,

00:49:12.617 --> 00:49:14.737
but this time I saw my dad
cry, that was his daughter.

00:49:14.737 --> 00:49:17.894
Trina was his daughter,
not his daughter-in-law

00:49:17.894 --> 00:49:19.827
and I'm right behind my
father about to see her

00:49:19.827 --> 00:49:21.897
for the last time on this earth

00:49:21.897 --> 00:49:24.018
and my father shared three words with me

00:49:24.018 --> 00:49:26.738
that changed my life
right there at the casket.

00:49:26.738 --> 00:49:29.604
It would be the last lesson
he would ever teach me.

00:49:29.604 --> 00:49:31.771
He said, "Son, just stand.

00:49:34.081 --> 00:49:36.748
"You keep standing, you keep stand,

00:49:36.748 --> 00:49:38.795
"no matter how rough the
sea, you keep standing

00:49:38.795 --> 00:49:41.469
"and I'm not talking about just water.

00:49:41.469 --> 00:49:43.907
"You keep standing no matter what,

00:49:43.907 --> 00:49:46.088
"you don't give up."

00:49:46.088 --> 00:49:49.426
and as clearly as I'm
talking to you today,

00:49:49.426 --> 00:49:52.518
these were some of her last words to me.

00:49:52.518 --> 00:49:55.124
She looked me in the eye and she said,

00:49:55.124 --> 00:49:58.306
"It doesn't matter to me
any longer how long I live.

00:49:58.306 --> 00:50:02.154
"What matters to me most is how I live.

00:50:02.154 --> 00:50:04.169
I ask y'all one question,

00:50:04.169 --> 00:50:06.287
a question that I was asked all my life

00:50:06.287 --> 00:50:08.553
by a third grade dropout.

00:50:08.553 --> 00:50:11.652
How you living, how you living?

00:50:11.652 --> 00:50:14.814
Everyday asked yourself that
question, how you living?

00:50:14.814 --> 00:50:18.981
Here's what a cook would
suggest you to live this way,

00:50:21.001 --> 00:50:24.817
that you would not judge,
that you would show up early,

00:50:24.817 --> 00:50:27.255
that you'd be kind,
that you make sure that

00:50:27.255 --> 00:50:30.852
that servants towel is huge and used.

00:50:30.852 --> 00:50:32.552
That if you're gonna do something,

00:50:32.552 --> 00:50:34.616
you do it the right way.

00:50:34.616 --> 00:50:36.640
That cook would tell you this,

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.991
that it's never wrong
to do the right thing,

00:50:38.991 --> 00:50:42.708
that how you do anything
is how you do everything

00:50:42.708 --> 00:50:44.522
and in that way, you
will grow your influence

00:50:44.522 --> 00:50:46.390
to make an impact, in that way,

00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:48.594
you will honor all those
who have gone before you,

00:50:48.594 --> 00:50:49.912
who have invested in you.

00:50:49.912 --> 00:50:52.913
Look in those unlikeliest
places for wisdom.

00:50:52.913 --> 00:50:57.468
Enhance your life every
day by seeking that wisdom

00:50:57.468 --> 00:51:01.256
and asking yourself every
night, how am I living.

00:51:01.256 --> 00:51:02.823
May God richly bless y'all.

00:51:02.823 --> 00:51:03.930
Thank you for having me.

00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:05.281
(audience applauding)

00:51:05.281 --> 00:51:08.031
(dramatic music)
