DRIVER, AND NO WITNESSES.

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:11.644 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT WOULD SEEM THAT SHE WAS
STILL ALIVE WHEN SHE WAS REMOVED

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:12.812 align:start position:0%
FROM THE CAR.

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:15.782
&gt;&gt; WHO WOULD DO SUCH A THING
LIKE THIS ON A PUBLIC ROADWAY?

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:19.052 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: WAS IT AN AMBUSH
OR A RANDOM ATTACK?

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:21.888 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THIS IS MY DEFENSELESS LITTLE
GIRL WHO HAD BEEN SHOT AT.

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:23.856 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS A HEAD-SCRATCHER FROM
THE GET-GO.

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:26.993 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: SOME TINY EVIDENCE
PROVIDES THE ANSWER.

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:29.262 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS ON HER SKIN, ON HER
JACKET.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:31.297
YOU CAN'T GET RID OF THIS STUFF.

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:42.975 align:start position:0%

INDEPENDENCE DAY.

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:51.851 align:start position:0%
SOME CELEBRATE A LITTLE TOO
MUCH.

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:55.788
THAT'S WHAT POLICE THOUGHT WHEN
THEY FOUND A DESERTED CAR AROUND

00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:59.225 align:start position:0%
4:00 IN THE MORNING, WITH THE
ENGINE STILL RUNNING, OFF

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:03.062 align:start position:0%
ROUTE 118, JUST NORTH OF
LOS ANGELES.

00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:06.766 line:0%
&gt;&gt; A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT
MAYBE SOMEBODY WAS DRUNK AND

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.735 align:start position:0% line:0%
THEY HAD ABANDONED THEIR CAR
ALONGSIDE THE ROAD.

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:13.573 line:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT A CLOSER LOOK
REVEALED SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:16.742 line:0%
&gt;&gt; WE HAD SEVERAL BULLETS THAT
HAD WENT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:19.745 align:start position:0% line:0%
INTO THE VEHICLE, AND TWO

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:31.858 align:start position:0%

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.863 align:start position:0%
POLICE FANNED OUT ALL OVER THE
AREA.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:40.633 align:start position:0%
THERE WAS NO BLOOD TRAIL, NO
VICTIM.

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:43.870 line:0%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS HIGHLY UNUSUAL FOR US
TO HAVE A VIOLENT-CRIME SCENE

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:46.639 align:start position:0% line:0%
LIKE THAT WHERE THE VICTIM WAS
MISSING.

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:50.409 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: THE CAR WAS A
RENTAL AND HAD BEEN LEASED THAT

00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:54.013 align:start position:0%
DAY TO MEGAN BARROSO, A
20-YEAR-OLD COLLEGE STUDENT WHO

00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:55.014 align:start position:0%
LIVED NEARBY.

00:01:55.047 --> 00:01:58.050
HER PURSE WAS COVERED IN BLOOD.

00:01:58.083 --> 00:01:59.752 size:78% position:39%
HER CELLPHONE WAS INSIDE.

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:06.726
IT LOOKED AS IF SHE HAD TRIED TO
USE HER PHONE TO CALL FOR HELP.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.530 line:0%
&gt;&gt; SHE HAD GONE TO A FOURTH OF

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:14.667 size:81% position:41% line:0%
AND OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE, I
BELIEVE IN THE BEACH AREA.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.070 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: ACCORDING TO
FRIENDS, MEGAN LEFT THE PARTY

00:02:18.103 --> 00:02:22.441 align:start position:0%
ALONE AT 2:45 A.M., A LITTLE
MORE THAN AN HOUR BEFORE HER CAR

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:23.976 align:start position:0%
WAS FOUND.

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.613 align:start position:0%
POLICE CHECKED LOCAL HOSPITALS,
BUT NO ONE MATCHING MEGAN'S

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:29.682 size:84% position:42%
DESCRIPTION HAD CHECKED IN.

00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:32.451 line:0%
&gt;&gt; WE DIDN'T KNOW IF THIS PERSON
WAS EITHER DEAD OR ALIVE AT THAT

00:02:32.484 --> 00:02:33.619 align:start position:0% line:0%
POINT.

00:02:33.652 --> 00:02:35.721 line:0%
THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT
OF BLOOD IN THE CAR, BUT NOT

00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:39.225 size:81% position:41% line:0%
ENOUGH TO SUGGEST THAT THE
PERSON WAS, IN FACT, DEAD.

00:02:39.258 --> 00:02:42.028 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; MY DAUGHTER WAS OUT THERE
SOMEWHERE, AND I WAS HOPING THAT

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:46.032 align:start position:0%
I WOULD GET A CALL FROM HER ANY
DAY, ANY MINUTE.

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:48.367 align:start position:0%
NO CALL CAME.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.072
&gt;&gt; Narrator: INVESTIGATORS FOUND
FIVE SHELL CASINGS AT THE END OF

00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:56.909 align:start position:0%
THE EXIT RAMP AND ANOTHER ABOUT
200 FEET AWAY.

00:02:56.942 --> 00:03:00.947
&gt;&gt; OUR FORENSIC PEOPLE WERE ABLE
TO TELL US THAT IT MOST LIKELY

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.786 align:start position:0%
WAS AN AK-47-TYPE RIFLE -- AN
ASSAULT RIFLE.

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.123 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; KNOWING THAT MEGAN HAD BEEN
ASSAULTED WITH THIS AK-47,

00:03:11.156 --> 00:03:17.296 align:start position:0%
AGAIN, JUST SENT CHILLS OF
AGONY THROUGH MY MIND.

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.801
&gt;&gt; Narrator: INVESTIGATORS ALSO
NOTICED A FRESH SCRAPE ALONG THE

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:24.704 size:78% position:39%
DRIVER'S SIDE OF THE CAR.

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:30.009 align:start position:0%
IT LOOKED AS IF MEGAN'S CAR HAD
BEEN SIDESWIPED.

00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:33.980 align:start position:0%
THEN INVESTIGATORS GOT A HUGE
BREAK.

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:38.084
THEY LEARNED THAT MEGAN'S RENTAL
CAR WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO BE

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
EQUIPPED WITH AN EVENT-DATA
RECORDER.

00:03:41.253 --> 00:03:44.023
&gt;&gt; THE EVENT-DATA RECORDER IS A
HUGE STEP FORWARD IN TRAFFIC

00:03:44.056 --> 00:03:45.157 align:start position:0%
SAFETY.

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:47.393 align:start position:0% line:0%
IT'S LIKE THE BLACK BOX IN AN
AIRCRAFT THAT GIVES US AN

00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:50.463 align:start position:0% line:0%
OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND
HOW CRASHES HAPPEN.

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:54.967 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: THE RECORDER, A
SMALL ON-BOARD COMPUTER, IS

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.168 align:start position:0%
ALWAYS ON.

00:03:56.201 --> 00:04:00.406 align:start position:0%
IN THE EVENT OF A CRASH, IT
AUTOMATICALLY SAVES THE PREVIOUS

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.242 size:88% position:44%
FIVE SECONDS OF INFORMATION.

00:04:03.275 --> 00:04:08.481
WHEN MEGAN'S CAR HIT THE MEDIAN,
IT ACTIVATED THE DATA RECORDER.

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:13.185
IT REVEALED THAT FIVE SECONDS
EARLIER, MEGAN'S CAR WAS AT A

00:04:13.218 --> 00:04:14.487 align:start position:0%
COMPLETE STOP.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.455 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I THINK HE STARTED SHOOTING
AT HER.

00:04:16.488 --> 00:04:19.458
SHE WAS PROBABLY DUCKING, BUT AT
SOME POINT, SHE REALIZED, "I'D

00:04:19.491 --> 00:04:20.926 size:78% position:39%
BETTER GET OUT OF THERE."

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.997
&gt;&gt; Narrator: THE RECORDER SHOWED
MEGAN FLOORED THE ACCELERATOR.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.699 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; SHE WENT TO 100% OPEN
THROTTLE.

00:04:26.732 --> 00:04:29.568
SHE JAMMED THAT GAS PEDAL TO THE
FLOOR, AND SHE TRIED TO GET OUT

00:04:29.601 --> 00:04:30.802 align:start position:0%
OF THERE.

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:35.174 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: BLOOD INSIDE THE
CAR SHOWED MEGAN WAS WOUNDED AND

00:04:35.207 --> 00:04:37.009 align:start position:0%
POSSIBLY STILL ALIVE.

00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:39.278 align:start position:0%
BUT WHERE WAS SHE?

00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:41.180 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WE KNEW WE HAD A BODY
SOMEWHERE.

00:04:41.213 --> 00:04:43.182 size:81% position:41%
WE JUST COULDN'T FIND HER.

00:04:45.317 --> 00:04:48.954
&gt;&gt; Narrator: AS POLICE SEARCHED
FOR 20-YEAR-OLD MEGAN BARROSO,

00:04:48.987 --> 00:04:52.425
THEY TRIED TO RECONSTRUCT HER
ACTIVITIES ON THE NIGHT OF HER

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:54.727 align:start position:0%
DISAPPEARANCE.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.131 align:start position:0%
HER FRIENDS SAID SHE LEFT A
FOURTH OF JULY PARTY AT 2:45 IN

00:04:59.164 --> 00:05:01.133 size:81% position:41%
THE MORNING AND WAS ALONE.

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:05.705

THE BOTTOM OF AN EXIT RAMP OFF A

00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:09.809 align:start position:0%
DESERTED STRETCH OF HIGHWAY
ABOUT AN HOUR LATER.

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:12.912 line:0%
&gt;&gt; WE FOUND THAT MEGAN DIDN'T
HAVE ANY BOYFRIEND PROBLEMS.

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:15.581 align:start position:0% line:0%
SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANYONE THAT WAS
UPSET WITH HER.

00:05:15.614 --> 00:05:17.183 line:0%
IN FACT, IT WAS THE OPPOSITE.

00:05:17.216 --> 00:05:19.552 align:start position:0% line:0%
EVERYBODY LIKED MEGAN.

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:23.255
&gt;&gt; Narrator: SOMEONE HAD FIRED
MULTIPLE SHOTS INTO MEGAN'S CAR

00:05:23.288 --> 00:05:28.227 align:start position:0%
WITH WHAT INVESTIGATORS BELIEVED
WAS AN AK-47 ASSAULT RIFLE.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.164 align:start position:0%
TO RE-CREATE THE SHOOTING,
ANALYSTS USED LASERS TO

00:05:32.197 --> 00:05:35.801 align:start position:0%
DETERMINE WHERE THE SHOOTER WAS
STANDING.

00:05:35.834 --> 00:05:39.839 align:start position:0% line:0%
&gt;&gt; WE USE A LASER BEAM BECAUSE
IT'S A NICE, STRAIGHT LIGHT

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:44.243 line:0%
BEAM THAT WE CAN JUST PROJECT
THROUGH A NUMBER OF HOLES.

00:05:44.276 --> 00:05:46.545 size:88% position:44%
AND IT MAKES A GOOD DISPLAY.

00:05:46.578 --> 00:05:51.150
IT ALLOWS US TO SEE WHERE THE
BULLET HAS PASSED THROUGH,

00:05:51.183 --> 00:05:52.718 size:81% position:41%
WHAT IT'S INTERACTED WITH.

00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:56.622
&gt;&gt; Narrator: THE LASER ANALYSIS
SHOWED THE SHOOTER STOOD 60 FEET

00:05:56.655 --> 00:06:00.793
AWAY FROM MEGAN'S CAR WHEN HE
STARTED FIRING, AND HE CLOSED

00:06:00.826 --> 00:06:04.130 size:88% position:44%
THE DISTANCE WITH EACH SHOT.

00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:06.298 align:start position:0%
ONE SHOT HIT THE HOOD.

00:06:06.331 --> 00:06:09.068 size:78% position:39%
THREE HIT THE WINDSHIELD.

00:06:09.101 --> 00:06:11.871 align:start position:0%
ANOTHER HIT THE DRIVER'S-SIDE
DOOR.

00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:15.875
INVESTIGATORS CONCLUDED THE SHOT
FIRED THROUGH THE PASSENGER-SIDE

00:06:15.908 --> 00:06:18.344
DOOR HAPPENED SOMEWHERE ELSE.

00:06:18.377 --> 00:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT CAME IN FROM A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:23.616
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN PART OF
THE SAME SERIES OF GUNFIRE

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:26.719 align:start position:0%
WITHOUT A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE
POSITION OF THE SHOOTER.

00:06:26.752 --> 00:06:30.456 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: THIS GUNSHOT, ALONG
WITH THE SIDESWIPE ON MEGAN'S

00:06:30.489 --> 00:06:34.193 align:start position:0%
CAR, LED ANALYSTS TO CONCLUDE
THIS ALTERCATION HAPPENED ON THE

00:06:34.226 --> 00:06:35.428 align:start position:0%
HIGHWAY.

00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:39.365 align:start position:0%
WITH THE LASER INFORMATION AND
EVENT-DATA RECORDER,

00:06:39.398 --> 00:06:44.036
INVESTIGATORS PUT TOGETHER THIS
ANIMATION OF WHAT THEY THOUGHT

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:45.270 align:start position:0%
HAPPENED.

00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:49.809
IT WAS CLEAR -- SOMEONE TRIED TO
FORCE MEGAN OFF THE HIGHWAY BY

00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:51.644 align:start position:0%
SIDESWIPING HER CAR.

00:06:51.677 --> 00:06:56.048
THEN MEGAN'S ATTACKER MOVED TO
THE PASSENGER SIDE AND FIRED

00:06:56.081 --> 00:06:57.650 align:start position:0%
INTO HER BACKSEAT.

00:06:57.683 --> 00:07:01.520 size:88% position:44%
AS MEGAN DROVE OFF THE EXIT
RAMP, HER ATTACKER MUST HAVE

00:07:01.553 --> 00:07:06.225
SPED IN FRONT OF HER, BLOCKED
HER PATH, AND STARTED SHOOTING.

00:07:06.258 --> 00:07:08.227 align:start position:0%
THERE WERE FOUR SHOTS.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.429 size:88% position:44%

POLICE.

00:07:20.038 --> 00:07:24.276 align:start position:0%
HER CAR HIT THE MEDIAN.

00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:28.380 align:start position:0%

CRIME WAS VERY BOLD, VERY MUCH
A RISK-TAKER.

118 IS A VERY PUBLIC ROADWAY.

00:07:57.676 --> 00:08:01.747 align:start position:0% line:0%
&gt;&gt; AT THAT POINT, I REALIZED
THAT MY DAUGHTER WAS IN HORRIBLE

TROUBLE, THAT THIS WAS NOT A
GOOD SITUATION.

00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:10.890 align:start position:0%

00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:14.193 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: THE SHERIFF'S
DEPARTMENT, ALONG WITH OTHER

00:08:14.226 --> 00:08:17.696 align:start position:0%
LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES,
OFFERED A REWARD FOR INFORMATION

00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:19.365 align:start position:0%
LEADING TO AN ARREST.

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:24.637
BUT THREE LONG WEEKS PASSED WITH
NO LEADS ON MEGAN'S ABDUCTION.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:28.774 align:start position:0%
THEN A SIMI VALLEY RESIDENT
CALLED POLICE WITH SOME

00:08:30.609 --> 00:08:35.247 size:84% position:42%

00:08:48.393 --> 00:08:53.232
&gt;&gt; Narrator: THE MAN SAID HE HAD
NO DOUBT THE RAPIST ON THE TAPE

00:08:53.265 --> 00:08:57.770
WAS HIS ROOMMATE, 30-YEAR-OLD
VINCENT SANCHEZ, AN ELECTRICIAN

00:08:57.803 --> 00:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
WHO WORKED IN THE LOCAL FILM
INDUSTRY.

00:09:01.773 --> 00:09:07.246 align:start position:0%
THE TAPE SHOWED SANCHEZ RAPING
NUMEROUS WOMEN ON-CAMERA.

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:11.784 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS QUITE HORRIFYING TO
ACTUALLY SEE A WOMAN BEING RAPED

00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:13.586 align:start position:0%
AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED.

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:16.989
&gt;&gt; Narrator: WHEN INVESTIGATORS
ASKED SANCHEZ'S ROOMMATE WHETHER

00:09:17.022 --> 00:09:21.894
ANYONE IN THE HOUSE OWNED AN
ASSAULT RIFLE, HE SAID HE DID.

00:09:21.927 --> 00:09:24.563
&gt;&gt; I'M SITTING ON THE BED, AND
HE TELLS ME, "WELL, YEAH, THE

00:09:24.596 --> 00:09:25.431 align:start position:0%
GUN'S RIGHT HERE.

00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:26.799 size:78% position:39%
IT'S UNDERNEATH THE BED."

00:09:26.832 --> 00:09:29.668
AND AS SOON AS I LOOKED AT IT,
THE HAIR ON THE BACK OF MY NECK

00:09:29.701 --> 00:09:31.337 align:start position:0%
STOOD UP.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.140
&gt;&gt; Narrator: IT WAS AN AK-47.

00:09:35.173 --> 00:09:39.078 align:start position:0%
DETECTIVES ALSO FOUND SOMETHING
NEAR THE TRASH OUTSIDE THE

00:09:39.111 --> 00:09:40.613 align:start position:0%
HOUSE.

00:09:40.646 --> 00:09:44.350
&gt;&gt; I EXCUSED MYSELF FROM THE
INTERVIEW TO TAKE A PHONE CALL,

00:09:44.383 --> 00:09:48.087 size:84% position:42%
AND I WALKED OUTSIDE THE
RESIDENCE, AND OVER BY SOME

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.558 align:start position:0%
TRASH CANS, I SAW A GARMENT OF
CLOTHING ON THE GROUND AND

00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:54.326 align:start position:0%
WALKED UP TO IT.

00:09:54.359 --> 00:09:56.762 align:start position:0%
AND I SAW THAT IT WAS A GREEN
JACKET.

00:09:56.795 --> 00:09:59.698 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS A GREEN GAP JACKET
WITH AN ORANGE LINING.

00:09:59.731 --> 00:10:01.667 size:81% position:41%
IT WAS FAIRLY DISTINCTIVE.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.970
AND HE SAW WHAT HE BELIEVED TO
BE A BULLET HOLE IN THE SIDE.

00:10:05.003 --> 00:10:08.374 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: IT WAS THE
SAME-COLOR JACKET MEGAN BARROSO

00:10:08.407 --> 00:10:12.845 align:start position:0%
WORE ON THE NIGHT SHE WAS
ABDUCTED.

00:10:12.878 --> 00:10:17.716 align:start position:0%
WAS IT POSSIBLE MEGAN WAS STILL
ALIVE?

00:10:20.052 --> 00:10:23.055 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: JUST DAYS AFTER
INVESTIGATORS FOUND

00:10:23.088 --> 00:10:26.859
MEGAN BARROSO'S GREEN JACKET IN
THE TRASH OUTSIDE A SIMI VALLEY

00:10:26.892 --> 00:10:31.563 size:84% position:42%

00:10:37.836 --> 00:10:43.075 align:start position:0%
DENTAL RECORDS CONFIRMED IT WAS
MEGAN BARROSO.

00:10:43.108 --> 00:10:44.843 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; I WAS DEVASTATED, OH!

00:10:44.876 --> 00:10:47.212 align:start position:0%
YOU KNOW, I MEAN...

00:10:47.245 --> 00:10:48.647 size:78% position:39% line:0%
I'M THINKING, "THIS IS...

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.848 align:start position:0% line:0%
I'M DROWNING NOW."

00:10:49.881 --> 00:10:52.251 line:0%
YOU KNOW, THIS IS -- THIS IS --
THIS IS -- IT WAS ABSOLUTELY

00:10:52.284 --> 00:10:53.352 align:start position:0% line:0%
TERRIBLE.

00:10:53.385 --> 00:10:54.353 align:start position:0%
OH!

00:10:54.386 --> 00:10:57.556 align:start position:0%
YOU KNOW, IT WAS LIKE, "THE
LIGHTS ARE OUT NOW.

00:10:57.589 --> 00:10:59.191 align:start position:0%
THIS IS BAD."

00:10:59.224 --> 00:11:02.995 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: THE MEDICAL
EXAMINER RECOVERED BULLET

00:11:03.028 --> 00:11:07.433 align:start position:0%
FRAGMENTS AND DETERMINED THAT
MEGAN DIED FROM A SINGLE GUNSHOT

00:11:07.466 --> 00:11:09.435 align:start position:0%
WOUND TO HER ABDOMEN.

00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:13.672 line:0%
&gt;&gt; BUT THERE WAS NOT FORENSIC
EVIDENCE TO CONCLUSIVELY SAY

00:11:13.705 --> 00:11:17.042 align:start position:0% line:0%
THAT SHE HAD BEEN SEXUALLY
ASSAULTED.

00:11:17.075 --> 00:11:21.013
&gt;&gt; Narrator: IT LOOKED AS IF
MEGAN WAS STILL ALIVE WHEN SHE

00:11:21.046 --> 00:11:23.315 align:start position:0%
WAS LEFT IN THE RAVINE.

00:11:23.348 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; SHE WAS IN A FETAL POSITION
WITH ONE ARM BENT UNDER HER

00:11:27.552 --> 00:11:30.322 align:start position:0%
HEAD, LIKE IN A SLEEPING
POSITION.

00:11:30.355 --> 00:11:33.525 align:start position:0% line:0%
THAT WOULDN'T BE A POSITION THAT
A BODY WOULD LAND IN.

00:11:33.558 --> 00:11:36.929
&gt;&gt; Narrator: THEN THE MEDICAL
EXAMINER NOTICED SOMETHING

00:11:36.962 --> 00:11:39.231 align:start position:0%
UNUSUAL -- RED GLITTER.

00:11:39.264 --> 00:11:43.102 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WHAT THEY CALL "PIXIE DUST"
IN MEGAN'S HAIR AND ON HER

00:11:43.135 --> 00:11:43.902 align:start position:0%
CLOTHING.

00:11:43.935 --> 00:11:46.371 align:start position:0%
AND IT WAS RED GLITTER, IN
ESSENCE.

00:11:46.404 --> 00:11:50.209 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: MEGAN'S GREEN
JACKET WAS FOUND OUTSIDE THE

00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:54.146 align:start position:0%
HOME OF VINCENT SANCHEZ, A
PART-TIME ELECTRICIAN WHO CAME

00:11:54.179 --> 00:11:58.484 align:start position:0%
TO POLICE ATTENTION WHEN HIS
ROOMMATE FOUND A HOMEMADE

00:11:58.517 --> 00:12:03.122 align:start position:0%
VIDEOTAPE OF SANCHEZ SEXUALLY
ASSAULTING SEVERAL WOMEN.

00:12:03.155 --> 00:12:07.159 align:start position:0%
WHEN POLICE STUDIED THE
VIDEOTAPE IN DETAIL, THEY

00:12:07.192 --> 00:12:11.663
DISCOVERED THE WOMEN WERE THE
VICTIMS OF THE SIMI VALLEY

00:12:11.696 --> 00:12:12.797 align:start position:0%
RAPIST.

00:12:12.831 --> 00:12:17.870 size:88% position:44%
15 UNSOLVED RAPES POLICE HAD
BEEN TRYING TO SOLVE FOR THE

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:19.304 align:start position:0%
PAST 5 YEARS.

00:12:19.337 --> 00:12:24.276
&gt;&gt; THE PERPETRATOR WOULD BREAK
IN TO THE HOME OF THE VICTIMS,

00:12:24.309 --> 00:12:26.445 size:78% position:39%
PRIMARILY IN THE EVENING.

00:12:26.478 --> 00:12:31.884
SOME OF THE VICTIMS WERE YOUNG
TEENAGE GIRLS, 15, 16 YEARS OLD,

00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:37.089 align:start position:0%
WITH PARENTS SLEEPING IN ANOTHER
ROOM WITHIN THE HOUSEHOLD.

00:12:37.122 --> 00:12:41.393
&gt;&gt; Narrator: WHEN QUESTIONED BY
POLICE, SANCHEZ ADMITTED HE WAS

00:12:41.426 --> 00:12:45.297 size:88% position:44%
THE SIMI VALLEY RAPIST, BUT
DENIED HAVING ANYTHING TO DO

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.399 size:88% position:44%
WITH MEGAN BARROSO'S MURDER.

00:12:47.432 --> 00:12:52.137 size:88% position:44% line:0%
&gt;&gt; VERY HESITANT TO ANSWER,
DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ANYMORE.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:55.107 line:0%
SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW HER, DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT,

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.176 size:88% position:44% line:0%
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.

00:12:57.209 --> 00:13:00.679 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: INVESTIGATORS
SEARCHED SANCHEZ'S PICKUP TRUCK

00:13:00.712 --> 00:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
FOR POSSIBLE CLUES.

00:13:02.013 --> 00:13:06.485
IT WAS CLEAR THE TRUCK HAD BEEN
THOROUGHLY WASHED AND CLEANED.

00:13:06.518 --> 00:13:12.457
BUT TAPE LIFTS OF THE UPHOLSTERY
FOUND SOMETHING VERY DIFFICULT

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:16.829 align:start position:0%
TO GET RID OF -- TINY SPECKS OF
RED GLITTER.

00:13:16.862 --> 00:13:21.333 size:88% position:44%
INVESTIGATORS ALSO FOUND RED
GLITTER IN THE GREEN JACKET

00:13:21.366 --> 00:13:23.702
FOUND OUTSIDE SANCHEZ'S HOME.

00:13:23.735 --> 00:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
THEY EVEN FOUND ONE MICROSCOPIC
SPECK ON THE AK-47 RIFLE

00:13:28.673 --> 00:13:32.444 align:start position:0%
SANCHEZ'S ROOMMATE TURNED OVER
TO POLICE.

00:13:32.477 --> 00:13:37.783 align:start position:0%
TO FIND OUT IF ALL THIS GLITTER
WAS FROM THE SAME SOURCE,

00:13:37.816 --> 00:13:42.321 size:75% position:38%
INVESTIGATORS SENT IT TO
EDWIN JONES, A FORENSIC

00:13:42.354 --> 00:13:46.825 align:start position:0%
SCIENTIST WITH ONE OF THE
LARGEST COLLECTIONS OF GLITTER

00:13:46.858 --> 00:13:51.063 align:start position:0%
IN THE WORLD, WITH CLOSE TO
1,000 SPECIMENS.

00:13:51.096 --> 00:13:54.633 line:0%
&gt;&gt; I HAVE AN UNUSUAL HOBBY OF
COLLECTING MICRO THINGS, AND

00:13:54.666 --> 00:13:57.603 line:0%
I'VE BEEN COLLECTING GLITTER FOR
MANY YEARS BEFORE THIS CASE, AND

00:13:57.636 --> 00:13:59.771 align:start position:0% line:0%
I'VE BEEN COLLECTING GLITTER
SINCE THIS CASE.

00:13:59.804 --> 00:14:05.077 line:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: UNDER A MICROSCOPE,
JONES DISCOVERED THAT THIS RED

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:11.250 size:84% position:42% line:0%
GLITTER WAS A HEXAGON SHAPE
APPROXIMATELY 250 MICRONS.

00:14:11.283 --> 00:14:15.854 align:start position:0%
JONES KNEW IMMEDIATELY THAT THIS
WAS UNLIKE ANY OF THE

00:14:15.887 --> 00:14:19.057 align:start position:0%
RED-GLITTER SAMPLES HE'D EVER
SEEN.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:22.427
&gt;&gt; I FOUND OUT THAT THE GLITTER
HAD ONE LAYER OF ALUMINUM FOR

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:23.661 align:start position:0%
REFLECTION.

00:14:23.695 --> 00:14:27.666
SO LITERALLY, THE PARTICLE WAS
ASYMMETRICAL, MEANING THAT IT'S

00:14:27.699 --> 00:14:29.534 size:84% position:42%
NOT THE SAME ON BOTH SIDES.

00:14:29.567 --> 00:14:32.738 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT'S RED ON ONE SIDE AND
SILVER ON THE OTHER.

00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:35.407 size:88% position:44% line:0%
IT WAS A VERY UNIQUE TYPE OF
GLITTER THAT JUST THIS ONE

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.975 align:start position:0% line:0%
COMPANY HAD MADE.

00:14:37.008 --> 00:14:40.579
&gt;&gt; Narrator: JONES DISCOVERED
THAT THIS GLITTER WAS NOT A

00:14:40.612 --> 00:14:41.847 align:start position:0%
BEST-SELLING ITEM.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.918 align:start position:0%
ONLY 10,000 BOTTLES HAD EVER
BEEN MADE.

00:14:45.951 --> 00:14:50.255 align:start position:0%
INVESTIGATORS LEARNED THAT
DURING THE FOURTH OF JULY PARTY

00:14:50.288 --> 00:14:54.426 align:start position:0%
MEGAN ATTENDED, THE HOST THREW
RED GLITTER ON EVERYONE,

00:14:54.459 --> 00:14:55.794 align:start position:0%
INCLUDING MEGAN.

00:14:55.827 --> 00:14:57.362 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THANKS.

00:14:57.395 --> 00:14:59.364 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I SAID, "DO YOU STILL HAVE
THE BOTTLE?"

00:14:59.397 --> 00:15:00.532 align:start position:0%
SHE SAYS, "YES, I DO."

00:15:00.565 --> 00:15:03.669
SO WE THEN WENT AND RECOVERED
THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE

00:15:03.702 --> 00:15:04.670 align:start position:0%
GLITTER.

00:15:04.703 --> 00:15:08.173 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: SCIENTISTS
CONFIRMED THE GLITTER IN

00:15:08.206 --> 00:15:12.911
MEGAN BARROSO'S HAIR CAME FROM
MEGAN'S FRIEND, AND IT WAS THE

00:15:12.944 --> 00:15:18.784
SAME GLITTER FOUND IN SANCHEZ'S
TRUCK, ON THE AK-47 RIFLE, ON

00:15:18.817 --> 00:15:24.523 align:start position:0%
MEGAN'S JACKET FOUND IN
SANCHEZ'S TRASH, AND IN MEGAN'S

00:15:24.556 --> 00:15:25.724 align:start position:0%
OWN CAR.

00:15:25.757 --> 00:15:30.662 align:start position:0%
IT WAS THE ONLY PIECE OF
EVIDENCE THAT TIED SANCHEZ TO

EVERYTHING.

00:15:32.897 --> 00:15:37.069 size:84% position:42%
INVESTIGATORS ALSO SEARCHED
SANCHEZ'S TRUCK FOR BLOOD.

00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:40.605
&gt;&gt; WHEN THE TECH PUT THE LUMINOL
ON THE INSIDE OF THE VEHICLE, IT

00:15:40.638 --> 00:15:42.240
LIT UP LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE.

00:15:42.273 --> 00:15:47.346 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: DNA TESTING
REVEALED BLOOD ON THE PASSENGER

00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:49.014 align:start position:0%
SEAT WAS MEGAN'S.

00:15:49.047 --> 00:15:53.118 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS A HORIZONTAL
APPARENT BLOODSTAIN RIGHT IN

00:15:53.151 --> 00:15:57.322
THE AREA WHERE MEGAN'S WOUND WAS
TO HER SIDE, INDICATING THAT SHE

00:15:57.355 --> 00:16:01.994
HAD BEEN SITTING UPRIGHT IN THE
PASSENGER SEAT OF THAT TRUCK AT

00:16:02.027 --> 00:16:04.196
ONE POINT, SO SHE WASN'T DEAD.

00:16:04.229 --> 00:16:05.530 align:start position:0%
SHE WAS SITTING.

00:16:05.563 --> 00:16:09.601

THE SCRAPE MARK ON THE SIDE OF

00:16:09.634 --> 00:16:13.238 align:start position:0%
MEGAN'S CAR MATCHED THE PAINT
FROM SANCHEZ'S TRUCK.

00:16:13.271 --> 00:16:18.176
INVESTIGATORS TEST-FIRED THE
AK-47 AND COMPARED THE BULLETS

00:16:18.209 --> 00:16:21.213 align:start position:0%
TO FRAGMENTS FOUND WITH MEGAN'S
BODY.

00:16:21.246 --> 00:16:24.883 size:88% position:44% line:0%

00:16:24.916 --> 00:16:28.687 line:0%
BOTH, WITH THE FRAGMENTS THAT
WERE TAKEN FROM THE CAR, FROM

THE CRIME SCENE.

00:16:30.355 --> 00:16:36.028 align:start position:0%

00:16:36.061 --> 00:16:39.264 align:start position:0%
MR. SANCHEZ THEN TO THE CRIME
SCENE.

00:16:39.297 --> 00:16:43.702 align:start position:0%

DISCOVERED THAT SANCHEZ'S REAL

00:16:43.735 --> 00:16:48.173 size:78% position:39%
TARGET THAT NIGHT WASN'T
MEGAN BARROSO AT ALL, BUT

00:16:48.206 --> 00:16:50.108 align:start position:0%
SOMEONE ELSE.

00:16:53.311 --> 00:16:56.915
&gt;&gt; Narrator: INVESTIGATORS
LEARNED THAT ON THE FOURTH OF

00:16:56.948 --> 00:17:00.285 align:start position:0%
JULY, VINCENT SANCHEZ HAD AN
ARGUMENT WITH A FORMER

00:17:00.318 --> 00:17:04.589
GIRLFRIEND, AND HE WAS ANGRY
BECAUSE SHE HADN'T INVITED HIM

00:17:04.622 --> 00:17:06.658 align:start position:0%
TO HER FAMILY PICNIC.

00:17:06.691 --> 00:17:11.863 align:start position:0% line:0%
&gt;&gt; WE THEORIZE HE TOOK THAT
AK-47, HE GOT IN HIS TRUCK, AND

00:17:11.896 --> 00:17:16.468 align:start position:0% line:0%
HE WAS PROBABLY OUT LOOKING FOR
HIS GIRLFRIEND.

00:17:16.501 --> 00:17:20.038 align:start position:0%

TO USE THE WEAPON ON HIS

00:17:20.071 --> 00:17:23.108 align:start position:0%
GIRLFRIEND OR HER FAMILY IS
UNCLEAR.

00:17:23.141 --> 00:17:28.613
BUT ALONG THE WAY, INVESTIGATORS
BELIEVE SANCHEZ SAW MEGAN AT AN

INTERSECTION, CHANGED HIS MIND,
AND DECIDED TO FOLLOW HER

00:17:33.418 --> 00:17:36.855 align:start position:0%
INSTEAD.

00:17:36.888 --> 00:17:44.329 align:start position:0%
THE EVIDENCE SHOWS SANCHEZ TRIED
TO GET MEGAN TO PULL OVER.

00:17:44.362 --> 00:17:47.165 align:start position:0%
HE THEN FIRED INTO MEGAN'S
BACKSEAT.

00:17:47.198 --> 00:18:00.312 align:start position:0%
[ GUNSHOT ]
AGAIN, MEGAN REFUSED TO STOP.

00:18:00.345 --> 00:18:06.184 align:start position:0%
SANCHEZ PULLED AHEAD OF HER, CUT
OFF HER PATH, AND STARTED

00:18:06.217 --> 00:18:12.491 align:start position:0%
SHOOTING.

00:18:12.524 --> 00:18:14.326 size:75% position:38%
MEGAN TRIED TO GET AWAY.

00:18:14.359 --> 00:18:17.262 align:start position:0%
SHE WAS HIT BY THE SHOT THROUGH
THE CAR DOOR.

00:18:17.295 --> 00:18:21.433
MEGAN MAY HAVE REACHED FOR HER
PHONE TO CALL FOR HELP, LOST

00:18:21.466 --> 00:18:31.576 align:start position:0%
CONTROL, AND HIT THE MEDIAN
BARRIER.

00:18:31.609 --> 00:18:40.318 align:start position:0%
SANCHEZ THEN ABDUCTED MEGAN AND
DROVE OFF.

00:18:40.351 --> 00:18:44.756 align:start position:0%
THE WHOLE TIME, SHE SHED THE
DISTINCTIVE RED GLITTER INTO HIS

00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:49.494 align:start position:0%
TRUCK, ONTO HIS RIFLE, AND ON
HER JACKET.

00:18:49.527 --> 00:18:54.199
MEDICAL EXPERTS BELIEVE MEGAN
WAS ALIVE WHEN SANCHEZ LEFT HER

00:18:54.232 --> 00:18:56.168 align:start position:0%
IN THE CANYON RAVINE.

00:18:56.201 --> 00:19:00.739
HE LEFT HER THERE WITHOUT HER
PANTS AND PROBABLY TOOK HER

00:19:00.772 --> 00:19:02.641 align:start position:0%
JACKET AS A TROPHY.

00:19:02.674 --> 00:19:07.312 line:0%
&gt;&gt; I COULDN'T GET AWAY FROM THE
IDEA THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED TO

00:19:07.345 --> 00:19:11.383 align:start position:0% line:0%
MY LITTLE GIRL -- THAT BEAUTIFUL
LITTLE GIRL WHO ALWAYS HAD A

00:19:11.416 --> 00:19:14.386 align:start position:0% line:0%
SMILE FOR ME, WHO ALWAYS GAVE
DAD A BIG HUG.

00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:15.554 align:start position:0% line:0%
I MISS HER HUGS.

00:19:15.587 --> 00:19:17.789 line:0%
TO THIS DAY, I MISS HER HUGS.

00:19:17.822 --> 00:19:23.595
&gt;&gt; Narrator: IN OCTOBER OF 2001,
SANCHEZ PLED GUILTY TO BEING THE

00:19:23.628 --> 00:19:28.200 size:88% position:44%
SIMI VALLEY RAPIST AND WAS
SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON.

00:19:28.233 --> 00:19:32.804 align:start position:0%
HE ALSO PLED GUILTY TO MEGAN'S
MURDER.

00:19:32.837 --> 00:19:37.542 size:78% position:39%
SANCHEZ CLAIMED HE DIDN'T
SEXUALLY ASSAULT MEGAN.

00:19:37.575 --> 00:19:42.447 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THE DEFENSE IN THIS CASE,
THEIR MAIN OBJECTIVE WAS TO SAVE

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.616 size:81% position:41%
HIM FROM A DEATH SENTENCE.

00:19:44.649 --> 00:19:49.454 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Narrator: BUT GIVEN SANCHEZ'S
PAST, JURORS CONCLUDED HE<i> DID</i>

00:19:49.487 --> 00:19:52.324 size:78% position:39%
SEXUALLY ASSAULT MEGAN...

00:19:52.357 --> 00:19:55.227 size:84% position:42%
AND SENTENCED HIM TO DEATH.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.895 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; HE HAS NO CONSCIENCE.

00:19:56.928 --> 00:20:01.066
I HATE TO SAY HE'S AN ANIMAL
BECAUSE IT'S JUST -- IT'S TOO

00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:03.134
NICE OF A DESCRIPTION FOR HIM.

00:20:03.167 --> 00:20:07.405 line:0%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS JUST SO AMAZING, ALL
THE DETAIL AND THE AMOUNT OF

00:20:07.438 --> 00:20:11.509 line:0%
EFFORT THAT WENT INTO EACH
LITTLE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE OF

00:20:11.542 --> 00:20:13.778 line:0%
THE FORENSIC SCIENCE OF IT ALL.

00:20:13.811 --> 00:20:18.850
&gt;&gt; Narrator: NO ONE DOUBTS THAT
SANCHEZ WOULD HAVE CLAIMED MORE

00:20:18.883 --> 00:20:20.585 align:start position:0%
VICTIMS.

00:20:20.618 --> 00:20:25.457 size:88% position:44%
BUT A STRANGE COMBINATION OF
EVIDENCE, RANGING FROM LASER

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:30.195 size:84% position:42%
BALLISTICS TO ANALYSIS OF A
CAR'S ON-BOARD COMPUTER TO

00:20:30.228 --> 00:20:34.499 align:start position:0%
SOMETHING AS SEEMINGLY
INSIGNIFICANT AS GLITTER, PROVED

00:20:34.532 --> 00:20:35.934 align:start position:0%
HIS GUILT.

00:20:35.967 --> 00:20:40.772 line:0%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS JUST AMAZING WHAT THE
CRIMINALISTS WERE ABLE TO DO AND

00:20:40.805 --> 00:20:45.176 align:start position:0% line:0%
THE EXPERTS WERE ABLE TO SAY TO
PUT TOGETHER A VERY VIVID

00:20:45.209 --> 00:20:49.347 align:start position:0% line:0%
PICTURE FOR THE JURY AS TO WHAT
HAPPENED OUT THERE.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:53.351 align:start position:0% line:0%
&gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY THE MOST
COMPELLING SCIENCE WAS THE

00:20:53.384 --> 00:20:57.956 align:start position:0% line:0%
BLOOD -- THE BLOOD FOUND IN
VINCENT'S VEHICLE, AND ALSO THE

00:20:57.989 --> 00:20:59.658 align:start position:0% line:0%
PIXIE GLITTER.

00:20:59.691 --> 00:21:03.428 align:start position:0% line:0%
THAT WAS AMAZING THAT THEY COULD
PUT THOSE PIECES OF PIXIE

00:21:03.461 --> 00:21:06.731 line:0%
GLITTER TOGETHER AND SHOW THAT
IT HAD BEEN LOCATED AT ALL THOSE

00:21:06.764 --> 00:21:10.035 align:start position:0% line:0%
DIFFERENT AREAS, AND IT WAS
CONSISTENT AMONGST EACH OTHER.
