00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.340
Beit Shearim, the most ancient extensive Jewish cemetery in the world.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:19.040
The wealth of artistic adornments contained in this necropolis is unparalleled anywhere.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.420
This place is nothing but unconventional and holds one of the world's greatest mysteries.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:36.340
What does a perfectly leveled and rectangular, a nine ton slab of glass doing in the middle of a burial cave?

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:44.240
And also, why did this small Jewish town of Beith Shearim need gates, walls, guard tower?

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.530
What were they protecting?

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.920
Stay tuned to find the answers to these questions.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.420
Beit Shearim was accidentally discovered by Alexander Zaid, a Russian immigrant who made Aliya in 1904.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.880
He was a famous guard who had a hobby- to dig.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.320
So in one of the outposts, he came here and started digging.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.540
What he found is one of the greatest archeological discoveries in Israel.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.460
An ancient Jewish necropolis.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.260
Lets go and take a look.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.100
Archeologists found here over 30 burial cave systems.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.920
And in addition to that some artifacts and inscriptions in three languages: Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.640
One of those inscriptions said "Bisara", its
Greek for Beit Shearim, the house of gates.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.000
This is the most ancient extensive Jewish cemetery in the world.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.380
There is nothing like it in its artistic adornments.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.880
After the destruction of the second temple in 70 AD, 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.240
The Sanhedrin, the Jewish supreme  council moved from Jerusalem to here.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.660
And with them, the head of the Sanhedrin, Yehuda Ha Nasi.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.250
And Rabbi Yehuda Ha Nasi is believed to be buried right here in this cave system.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.159
We have inscription of the names of his family that are buried here.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.560
And other heads of Sanhedrin.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.600
Its incredible.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.930
So why are there so many burial caves here?

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.050
And why are they so fancy?

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.800
Well, one theory is, that after the Romans had prohibited the Jews to be buried on Mt. of Olives in Jerusalem,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.240
 Beit Shearim became the alternative.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.800
And after the head of the Sanhedrin was buried here, 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.360
Practically, every other Jew wanted to be buried by his side.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.360
I mean after all, who wouldn't want to be
buried next to the Prince of Judah.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.060
But maybe there is another reason.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.360
For the longest time, historians were baffled by the name of this place.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.660
Its called Beit Shearim, the house of gates, but where are the gates?

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.100
Where are the wall that are connected to those gates?

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.140
And why such a small town would need gates and walls?

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.800
Last year archeologists had finally excavated a Roman era gate, and a guard tower right next to it.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.780
This confirmed the name of the town, bit also posed a riddle, why did this town need them?

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.220
What were they protecting?

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.560
The answer to that question might just lie
in one of the worlds greatest mysteries.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.040
A nine tone ancient slab of glass in the middle
of a necropolis.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.460
So you're looking at this and you're saying
"wait a second, it's a rock"!

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.660
It looks like a rock and it feels like a rock.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.440
Well, somebody in the 1950s suggested that this is glass, and they laughed at them.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.380
So in 1963, they were making a research about ancient glass.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.060
So they drilled a sample out of the middle of the rock.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.700
It took them hours to drill through.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.020
And they took it to the lab.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.180
And then analysis from the lab showed that the chemical composition of this material is glass.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.000
In fact, it is nine ton of it.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.190
Nine ton of glass.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.720
That equals to 60,000 perfume bottles.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.420
To produce such a slab of glass, they would need: 12 tons of raw material.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:08.200
20 tons of fuel, an 1100 degrees centigrade furnace that burns 5-10 days continually.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.640
To put it in to perspective, imagine, 12 full
truck loads of sand, 250 wood logs, 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.180
That if you put on top of each other, would come out almost twice higher than the empire state building.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.860
And a furnace that can melt most metals.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.660
So the question is: Why is this glass not transparent?

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.420
And the answer lies in the chemical composition.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:40.520
This glass is defected, it has twice more
lime than its supposed to have - %16 instead of %8.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.100
So what is this glass doing here?

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.200
Well one theory is that this cave was turned in to a glass factory, or at least they tried.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.020
And in the process of making it, as this place was hot and burning for 5 days, 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.120
Lime from the limestone from the ceiling dripped down into the raw material, and added more lime,

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.440
And added more lime than it needs to be, making it defected.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.880
So, they left this factory.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.680
They said its a goner.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.500
That theory is a bit bizarre because why would they start a glass factory in the middle of the cave, a burial cave?

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.920
That's a difficult one to answer.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.990
But there's another theory.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.260
One that is very very interesting.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:26.480
Until recently, scholars believed that glass
was first invented in Egypt 3000 years ago,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:33.700
But recent discoveries have led the researches to push the date back by 800 years, into the land of Ur.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.260
That's right!

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.320
Abraham's home town.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.160
The technology followed him into Canaan, then to Egypt, then back to Canaan, 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.000
And from there it spread across the world with the help of the Roman Empire.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:55.880
And here are the interesting facts, the remains of the largest glass factory of the ancient world is found no where else but Israel.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.500
On the coast of Hedera.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.300
A whooping 17 ancient furnaces.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:07.060
And another fact: the oldest blown glass ever found was also discovered in Israel, 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.620
In the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:15.980
Is it possible that the secret recipe of glass making was passed from father to son among the Hebrews?

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.220
So what about this giant slab of glass?

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:26.740
In 1 Kings 6:4 the Bible describes how Solomon constructed the temple windows:

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.680
“He made narrow windows high up in the temple walls.”

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.120
Looking at this verse in Hebrew shed more light on the mystery! 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.220
.“וַיַּ֣עַשׂ לַבָּ֔יִת חַלֹּונֵ֖י שְׁקֻפִ֥ים אֲטֻמִֽים” 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.700
The word Shkufim (שְׁקֻפִ֥ים) means Transparent and the word Atumim (אֲטֻמִֽים) means Sealed.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.400
Transparent and Sealed windows.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.740
Could this be referring to glass?

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:58.400
Is it possible that King Herod rebuilt the
2nd temple with actual giant glass windows inside of it?

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.660
Could it be that after the destruction of
the temple in 70 AD, 

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:08.480
One window survived but got contaminated in fire by the limestone temple walls?

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.060
And what if the Jews were able to move this window to Beit Shearim?

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:20.000
This crazy theory would explain why such a small town needed walls to protect it.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:27.080
And why every other Jew wanted to be buried by the last remaining holy article from the temple.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:34.500
So it might just be that I'm touching a temple artifact.
