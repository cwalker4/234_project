00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.900
- Someone should push my cart
for me, you know?

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.933
I'm a celebrity.
[laughter]

00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.033
male announcer:
"Repeat After Me."

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:08.800
Tuesdays on ABC.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.933
- There's a kindergarten teacher

00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.933
from Albuquerque, New Mexico
in our audience.

00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.766
I want you to meet her.
Sonya Romero, come on down!

00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.700
You teach kindergarten,
and what is the question--

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.200
the first question you ask
every morning?

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.033
- So I ask my kids if they've
eaten that morning,

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:26.733
if they need anything to wear
or need to brush their teeth

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.266
or comb their hair.

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.466
We usually spend about the first
hour of our morning

00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.466
getting ready for our day
to learn, and I--

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:36.666
I feel like, as educators, we're
sort of first responders, so...

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:40.000
- And so--and you've taken in
two foster kids.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.600
You have two children
of your own, right?

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.133
- I have one son.
- One son.

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.066
He's in the audience, I think.
- He is, he is.

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.300
- So, he was just watching--

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:53.600
[cheers and applause]

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.400
So you have one son, and--
aren't you proud of your mom?

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.666
Doesn't--isn't she cool?

00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:00.400
- Yeah, I'm very proud.
- Yeah, she's--

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.233
She's an amazing woman.
So then you took in

00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:06.566
two foster children--
tell everyone the story of that.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.800
- So they were two of
my former students.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.066
They were in my class,
and, um,

00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.400
Child Protective Services
had come that day

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.233
and I think any time Child
Protective Services comes to,

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:20.466
you know, a school, you know
it's never a good thing.

00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.466
And they were there that day.

00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:24.600
It was a Friday
and I got a call,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.766
because they had requested if
I would have them for 48 hours,

00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:31.300
and I said, "Of course."
They're beautiful children,

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.666
and so I sent my family out
to get--we had nothing,

00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:37.200
so we got toothbrushes and
jammies and underwear

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.033
and brushes and, uh,
they've been with us ever since.

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:42.566
- For how long now?
- Six months.

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:43.533
- Six months.
- Six months.

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:45.000
- Good for you.
You're amazing.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.033
[cheers and applause]
- Thank you.

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:47.733
- You're amazing.
- Thank you.

00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:53.400
[cheers and applause]

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.100
- We have a little surprise
for you,

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.566
if you look at that monitor
right there.

00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:57.766
- Okay.

00:01:57.766 --> 00:01:59.766
["I Bet My Life"
by Imagine Dragons plays ]

00:01:59.766 --> 00:02:01.266
- Miss Sonya inspires me

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:03.333
because she's just fun.

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:08.466
- When we say we love her,
she says she--she loves us back.

00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:12.566
- I still visit her, just to
say hi and give her a hug.

00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:15.233
Makes me feel, like, comfort,
kind of.

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:16.866
- And I want to be like her
when I grow up.

00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:20.133
I want to be able to make
everyone feel like they're equal

00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:22.600
and they all have some part in
the world that they can improve,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.233
they can make it a better place,

00:02:24.233 --> 00:02:27.266
- Miss Sonya is the embodiment
of all the best

00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:28.466
that goes on here the school.

00:02:28.466 --> 00:02:30.733
- The way she connects
with students

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:33.200
is--is really authentic.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.266
She decides what their
strengths are,

00:02:36.266 --> 00:02:39.200
and she really kind of pulls
that out of them.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.866
- Teachers are supposed to have
these professional boundaries,

00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:45.266
and whatnot, but she really--
her heart has no boundaries.

00:02:45.266 --> 00:02:48.166
- She starts every morning
making sure all of her students

00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:51.466
have clean clothes
and they've eaten breakfast.

00:02:51.466 --> 00:02:54.133
- Sonya was here late one night,

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:57.066
and we had two children
in crisis,

00:02:57.066 --> 00:02:58.866
and the social worker
could not find

00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:00.966
an emergency placement
for those children.

00:03:00.966 --> 00:03:04.133
- Without a second thought,
Sonya said, "I will take them."

00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:06.333
- Well, a weekend became a week,

00:03:06.333 --> 00:03:09.500
became "I'll just help them
through the holidays,"

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.633
and now she is full-on
their foster mom.

00:03:12.633 --> 00:03:15.133
- Sonya says, over and over,
"This is not about me.

00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:17.000
This is about all of us."

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.433
[music resumes, singing]
So I, I bet my life--

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:22.566
[applause]
- Thank you for all that you do.

00:03:22.566 --> 00:03:24.200
to make the world
a better place.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.066
- Thank you for being awesome.

00:03:26.066 --> 00:03:28.100
- Thank you for teaching me,

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.600
I'm really happy that you did.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.866
(all)
We love you, Miss Sonya!

00:03:34.866 --> 00:03:39.300
[cheers and applause]

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.200
- Thank you so much.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.733
[crying]

00:03:42.733 --> 00:03:45.166
- Well, now I'm crying too,
because--

00:03:45.166 --> 00:03:46.633
[laughter]
It's sweet as can be,

00:03:46.633 --> 00:03:48.900
and your son's crying--
you're an amazing woman.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.966
Now we're gonna--we want
to talk about the school, and--

00:03:53.966 --> 00:03:55.466
Tell everyone the name
of it again,

00:03:55.466 --> 00:03:57.533
because I want people
to help it.

00:03:57.533 --> 00:04:00.900
- Lew Wallace Elementary
in downtown Albuquerque, NM.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.300
- Go to our website if you--
'cause when you hear

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.900
the budget that they have, and
what comes out of her pocket--

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.666
we want to help this school,
we want to help these kids.

00:04:08.666 --> 00:04:10.366
And we're gonna help you
when we come back.

00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:12.600
So you're busy and you're
spending a lot of money,

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.233
because you care about
these kids--

00:04:14.233 --> 00:04:15.833
- Absolutely.
- And so Target wants to

00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:17.400
help you, they want to help.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.533
And I know that you've gotten
a donation for $100,

00:04:20.533 --> 00:04:22.366
from someone who was
a good Samaritan.

00:04:22.366 --> 00:04:23.966
You turned around and gave
that $100

00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:26.133
to a woman you saw crying
on a bench.

00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:28.600
So Target wants to give you
$10,000.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.833
- Oh, my God.
[cheers and applause]

00:04:29.833 --> 00:04:32.433
[cheers and applause]

00:04:32.433 --> 00:04:33.566
- This is for you.

00:04:33.566 --> 00:04:35.733
[cheers and applause]

00:04:35.733 --> 00:04:36.733
And...

00:04:36.733 --> 00:04:42.400
[cheers and applause]

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.433
And because I know
what kind of person you are,

00:04:44.433 --> 00:04:46.533
and you think you're going to
use this $10,000

00:04:46.533 --> 00:04:48.966
to help other people,
they also want to give

00:04:48.966 --> 00:04:51.600
$10,000 to Lew Wallace

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.066
so you're gonna get another--

00:04:53.066 --> 00:04:54.500
- Oh, my gosh!
[cheers and applause]

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.400
[cheers and applause]

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.600
- Oh, my--
- So one's for you,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.633
one's for the school.
