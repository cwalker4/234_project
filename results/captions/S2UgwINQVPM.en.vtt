Welcome to Kunming, "Spring City" of China.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.140

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.260
[Annette Lamothe-Ramos]: Kunming

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.440
is the capital city

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.600
of the Yunnan province,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.040
in southwest China.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.060
The weather here

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.120
always brings to mind

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.080
early spring.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.540
But, I didn't come from the depths of winter

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.040
in New York

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.860
for the weather.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.200
I came to check out

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.220
a very peculiar

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.060
and controversial tourist attraction,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.880
(located) about an hour outside the city,

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.400
that people have been talking about for years.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.920
A place called "Kingdom of the Little People".

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.940
[Annette Lamothe-Ramos]: From what I saw on TV,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.840
I expected it to be "The Wizard of Oz" on acid.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.160
On arrival,

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.760
I realized (that what) was touted

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.060
as a magnificient, and whimsical theme park,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.320
was really a run-down, abandoned place

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.380
that made me instantly feel uncomfortable.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.420
[Chime sound]

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.600
This

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.380
is "The Kingdom of the Little People".

[Music]

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.880
[Annette Lamothe-Ramos]: "Kingdom of the Little People"

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.380
was founded in 2009

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.840
by wealthy real-estate mogul,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.000
Chen Mingjing;

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.460
and, as you can imagine,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.780
has since been the centre

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.100
of a lot of controversy.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.900
Media outlets like

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.880
the Daily Mail,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.900
The New York Times;

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.140
and organizations like

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.480
Little People of America

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.280
and Handicap International

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.560
have criticized the park

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.440
with claims that it's the equivalent of a human zoo,

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.500
and that (the park) only serves to increase negative stereotypes.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.460
Even Warwick Davis,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.840
the famous English actor of short stature

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.720
who played Willow,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.680
has openly expressed his distaste for the establishment.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.780
But, I wanted to see what the park was really about  myself.

Is that the character that you play in the show?

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.300
So, in between shows,

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.280
do you get to hang out

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.100
and-

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.920
you know, read books, or..?

[Crowd playing tug-of-war]

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.880
[Annette Lamothe-Ramos]: At first glance,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.520
the little people we met seemed exceptionally cheerful,

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.780
but I wondered whether it was their directives

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.540
to appear pleasant at all times;

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.420
which would be in line with most theme parks,

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.500
but most theme parks

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.060
are not almost exclusively stuffed with little people.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.180
However, I'm not going to lie;

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.340
while speaking with them,

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.360
I became confused

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.960
about whether I should approach them like children or adults.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.420
Perhaps, that was because the park's higher-ups

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.080
tended to treat their shorter staff members like kids,

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.580
even though their ages range

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.080
from 19 to 49.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.820
when

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.700
your parents told you that you

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.340
weren't going to continue growing?

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.780
[Annette Lamothe-Ramos]: Employees here

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.300
mainly suffer from two forms of dwarfism:

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.280
disproportionate dwarfism,

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.480
the umbrella term for genetic disorders that

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.000
cause unusual proportions of their body parts;

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.040
and proportionate dwarfism,

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.580
which results from hormonal deficiency.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.020
What they all have in common,

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.240
is that they're no taller

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.020
than 4 feet, 3 inches;

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.320
which is the main requirement

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.320
for working as a performer at the Kingdom.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.700
[Sound of crowd]

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.060
[Annette Lamothe-Ramos]: One thing about the Kingdom,

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.420
is that performers who work in such close proximity

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.640
sometimes fall in love;

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.720
like Aifang and Chenjiao,

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.620
a couple I met

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.300
who have been dating for over a year,

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.800
and who both suffer from proportional dwarfism.

switch careers and come

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.840

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.700
come from all different backgrounds.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.400
They make a monthly salary

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.180
ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 RMB

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.100
which is roughly

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:47.820
the equivalent

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.460
to what a university graduate would make in the area.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.600
They hold positions throughout the company,

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.100
ranging from accountants to sales representatives,

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:28.940
the park

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.360
because

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.840
they believe that,

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.180
by the performances,

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.580
it might be drawing negative attention

I've come to the conclusion

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.280
that the controversies surrounding the park

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.480
don't really matter at all.
