00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.670
From books containing the secrets of the universe
so swords that can bring the dead back to

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.500
life, here are 10 amazing treasures from Mythology…..

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.200
10.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.300
Draupnir

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.920
Draupnir is a legendary gold ring that comes
from Norse mythology.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.050
Imbued with magical powers, it was forged
by the dwarfs Eitri and Brokk who were known

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.050
for making powerful objects.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.500
Brokk stood before the gods in Asgard and
presented the ring to Odin as proof of their

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.530
abilities!!

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.859
In mythology Dwarves are famous from making
magical objects like rings and giving them

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:40.100
as gifts to gods and goddesses.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.530
Draupnir was nicknamed “the dripper” and
had the magical ability to multiply itself,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.580
providing never-ending wealth to its owner.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.590
Legend has it that every ninth night, eight
new rings dropped from Draupnir, each of which

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.030
were as heavy and bright as the first.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.840
It was, therefore, the most precious and valuable
ring to have ever been made.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.579
In the story of ‘Balder’s Funeral’,
Odin placed his ring on his son Balder’s

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:04.579
funeral pyre.

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:10.660
But his brother Hermod, went to the underworld
to try to get Balder back but he never returned.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.820
However, Hermod made the 9 day journey on
his father’s 8-legged horse sleipnir and

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.490
was able to bring back the ring Draupnir.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.490
9.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.880
The Book of Thoth

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.800
First mentioned in the Turis papyrus, a document
that was published in Paris in the late 18th

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.700
century, the Book of Thoth was a sacred tome
of Egyptian texts, supposedly written by the

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.450
god of writing and knowledge.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.840
It is said to contain a number of spells,
such as giving you the power to speak to animals,

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.700
or to witness the gods themselves.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.280
According to legend, anyone who reads the
book would gain the power to decipher the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.180
secrets of the earth, the sea, the air, and
all celestial bodies.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.840
The book itself was said to have been originally
hidden at the bottom of the Nile near Coptos,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.610
and locked inside a series of boxes that were
guarded by invincible serpents.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.780
The Egyptian prince, Neferkaptah, went to
recover it and, after battling past the serpents,

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.080
managed to retrieve it.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.369
However, as punishment for stealing from Thoth,
the gods killed his wife and son, which led

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.350
to him committing suicide and being entombed
along with the book.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.620
The texts contain the knowledge of the gods,
but is this information that mere mortals

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.879
should possess?

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.870
Maybe this is a treasure that is best left
lost to history!

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:24.870
8.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.069
The Cup of Jamshid

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.219
Persepolis was one of the most important cities
of the Persian empire, and for more than 200

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:36.640
years served as its capital- mainly thanks
to its ruler, Jamshid, who according to legend,

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.260
presided over the city for hundreds of years.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.290
The city’s name means ‘the throne of Jamshid’,
and his wisdom made the city powerful and

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.030
rich, and the kingdom was the envy of all
who encountered it.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.300
So how was he able to live and let alone rule
for 200 years??

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.879
This was said to be because of his cup.

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.800
Similar to the supposed powers of the Holy
Grail, the cup of Jamshid granted immortality

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.739
to those who drank from it.

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.890
The similarities between the cup of Jamshid
and the Holy Grail are impossible to ignore,

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.440
and interestingly the one from Persian legend
was written about more than a century before

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.739
the one from European culture.

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.200
Some people believe the cup of Jamshid was
therefore, the inspiration for the Holy Grail

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.400
in European texts, but there are some very
distinct differences.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.159
Jamshid’s cup was very much an example of
his power and affluence, as opposed to that

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.870
of God’s, while the story of the Holy Grail
contains deep religious significance since

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.709
it was part of the last supper.

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.139
Is it one and the same?

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:36.689
You be the judge!!

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:37.909
7.

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.040
The Kusanagi

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.069
The Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi is a legendary Japanese
sword whose name translates to mean the ‘grass

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.870
cutting sword' or ‘herb quelling sword'.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.889
It's one of the three imperial regalias of
Japan, along with a mirror and jewel, and

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.680
is believed to represent the virtue of valor.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.989
The sword is believed to be housed in the
Atsuta Shrine in Nagoya, but no-one knows

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:00.989
for certain.

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.210
It’s used during the coronation ceremony
of the Japanese Emperor, the last of which

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.139
happened in 1989, but even the Emperor hasn’t
actually seen the sword.

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.219
It’s covered with wrappings because it is
believed to be cursed.

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:17.580
But it’s perhaps the origin story of the
sword that’s most interesting.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.220
A wealthy family in the province of Izumo
was being terrorized by a horrific eight-headed

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.890
serpent called Yamata-no-Orochi.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.630
Over the years it had eaten seven of the family’s
eight daughters and, terrified that he would

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.410
lose his final daughter, the father requested
the help of the Shinto god of the sea and

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.160
storms, Susanoo.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.630
Susanoo agreed to help in exchange for the
daughter's hand in marriage and set off to

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.770
kill the serpent.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.620
At first, he was unsuccessful, and so had
to come up with a cunning plan.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.690
He laid eight bowls of sake out for the snake,
and once each head was drunk and drowsy, he

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.260
cut off their heads, along with the tail.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.980
As he removed the tail, an incredible sword
was revealed, the sword that would become

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.070
known as the Kusanagi.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.230
And that’s how it’s done!!

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.230
6.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.570
Thor’s Hammer

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.460
When you think of Thor’s hammer, you’d
be forgiven for immediately conjuring up images

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.290
of the weapon that Thor wields in the Marvel
movies, but the hammer from Norse legend is

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.660
arguably much more impressive.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.400
Known as Mjöllnir, the hammer was created
by the same dwarves who forged Odin’s magical

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.400
ring, Draupnir.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.610
Thor’s brother, Loki, had made a bet and
said that the dwarves couldn’t make things

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.070
as magical or as beautiful as these other
brothers.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.150
Loki wanted them to make three magical objects
in an attempt to gain forgiveness from his

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.310
brother for a trick that he had played.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.630
The hammer, the finest weapon in the universe,
had one flaw- its short handle- something

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.970
that happened because Loki, taking on the
form of a fly, bit the eyelid of the dwarf

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.780
who was making it at the time.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.830
This guy was always causing problems!!

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.700
Nevertheless, the hammer became a thing of
legend.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.920
Thor guarded Asgard, the home of gods and
goddesses in Norse mythology, and they were

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.280
always under threat from the giants, the forces
of chaos trying to destroy them.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.120
The hammer became Thor’s primary weapon
and the sound of thunder was thought to be

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.840
the sound of Thor smashing the hammer down
on his foes, but the weapon took on other

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.150
roles too.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.780
It was used in formal ceremonies such as ones
to bless marriages, births, and deaths…

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.070
and even used for resurrections.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.630
One Norse legend tells the tale of when Thor
ate his pet goats, then brought their bones

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.660
back to life with the power of Mjöllnir.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.170
Now, that’s something you’ll never see
him do in the Avengers!

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.190
5.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.850
The Cintamani Stone

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.610
The Cintamani Stone is a legendary gem from
Buddhist and Hindu mythology that fulfills

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.040
the wishes of whoever holds it.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.030
According to legend, the gem fell from the
stars and landed in Tibet, where the Buddhists

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.510
worshipped it as a spiritual jewel.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.900
As time passed, its true power became apparent,
though, and it was moved to the hidden city

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.950
of Shambhala where it would be safe from falling
into the wrong hands.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.980
The word Cintamani translates to mean the
‘thought-gem’, or the ‘wishing stone’,

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.520
and it was said to be a green gem that was
a trapezohedron in shape, which means each

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.510
side was a trapezium!

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:08.070
The greater powers of the stone were believed
to have come from a dimension beyond our perception,

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.220
and it would grant the holder access to this
higher sense of being- and grant knowledge

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.860
of time and space, as well as granting immortality.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:22.150
Einstein and Stephen Hawking would have probably
killed to get their hands on this!

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.320
So similar are these traits to the Philosopher’s
stone and the holy grail, that there are some

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.440
that believe that these three objects are,
in fact, the same thing.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.790
These stories are, of course, legends, but
there could be an element of truth to them.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.570
The descriptions of a green gem falling from
the stars could have been moldavite, a type

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.840
of natural glass that is formed from a meteor
strike.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.240
At the time, a meteor would have been seen
as a mystical event, and a green gem found

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.150
in the crater would surely have taken on a
magical role.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.150
4.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.480
The Apple of Eris

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.710
The Golden Apple of Eris was, perhaps, the
most controversial artifact in mythology,

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:02.230
and one that would set some of the most renowned
events into action.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:07.810
Eris was the Greek Goddess of strife, contention,
and rivalry and, tellingly, her Roman name

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.360
was ‘Discordia’.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.200
She was usually portrayed haunting battlefields
and delighting in human bloodshed, and she

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.970
was renowned for her disagreeable nature.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:22.500
It was because of this that she was the only
goddess to not be invited to the wedding of

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.250
Peleus and Thetis.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.930
This didn’t stop her from trying to attend
the celebration, though, and when she was

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:33.669
turned away she was so angry that she threw
a golden apple amongst the other goddesses,

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:39.130
upon which was inscribed the words ‘To the
fairest’.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:44.069
Three goddesses tried to claim it for themselves-
Hera, Aphrodite, and Athena.

00:08:44.069 --> 00:08:48.490
This led to a great rivalry between the three,
that resulted in the beginnings of the Trojan

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:49.490
war.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:53.680
This apple caused so much suffering and war,
that it’s by far the most deadly treasure

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.800
from mythology, and one to be extremely wary
of should it ever turn out to be real!

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.820
Anything with beauty and an apple can’t
be good!!

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:02.820
3.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.050
The Club of Dagda

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:09.190
This next treasure comes from Irish mythology,
where Dagda was one of the most important

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.310
of a race of Gods known as the Tuatha De Danann.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:16.889
He was the god of knowledge, abundance, of
life and of death… and he could even control

00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:19.040
the weather to affect the harvest.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.639
He had a cauldron of plenty and two pigs that
he used to help feed people, but his most

00:09:23.639 --> 00:09:25.860
famed possession was his club.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:30.300
It was an eight-pronged war club that was
so heavy that it would take eight strong mortals

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.190
to lift it from the ground.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:36.880
With this club, Dagda could use one end to
kill nine people with one blow, or the other

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.130
end to bring them back to life.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:40.149
2.

00:09:40.149 --> 00:09:42.459
The Peaches of Immortality

00:09:42.459 --> 00:09:47.009
Said to have grown in the garden of a Chinese
goddess, the peaches of immortality, quite

00:09:47.009 --> 00:09:51.509
predictably, grant those fortunate enough
to eat them with never-ending life.

00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:55.490
They are mentioned in Taoist mythology and
are so special that they would only ripen

00:09:55.490 --> 00:10:00.529
after a very long time, at which point they
were served at a banquet for the immortals.

00:10:00.529 --> 00:10:05.790
The goddess Xiwangmu, the wife of the supreme
Taoist god the Jade Emperor, lived in the

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:10.689
Kunlun mountains where, at her home called
the ‘Jade Pool’, she had many thousands

00:10:10.689 --> 00:10:12.819
of these peach trees in an orchard.

00:10:12.819 --> 00:10:18.069
They would only ripen every 3000 years, though,
but when the gods ate them at the banquet

00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:21.420
they would be imbued with immortality and
eternal youth.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:26.459
Despite being only for the gods, Taoist legend
suggests that two humans have been blessed

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:27.920
with the peaches too.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:33.330
The first was King Mu of Zhou, who had traveled
to the Kunlun mountains and met Xiwangmu,

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.029
and the second was the Emperor Wu of Han.

00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:40.040
The association of peaches with immortality
has meant that the fruit has become linked

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:46.190
with longevity in Chinese culture, and they
are routinely depicted in artworks, as decorations,

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.189
and on birthday cards and cakes.

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:49.189
1.

00:10:49.189 --> 00:10:50.499
The Golden Fleece

00:10:50.499 --> 00:10:54.600
The Golden Fleece is one of the most famous
treasures from mythology, having been the

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:59.160
prize that Jason and his Argonauts sought
in order for him to take his rightful place

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.720
on the throne of Iolcus.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.910
The lesser known story, though, is the origin
of the fleece.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:09.230
Athamus, the king of Orchomenus, had married
the goddess Nephele, and they had two children-

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.079
a boy, Phrixus, and a girl, Helle.

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:16.120
Athamus eventually went on to marry a new
wife, which led to Nephele leaving the city

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.660
and causing a drought across the land.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:23.360
The new wife of Athamus was jealous of her
stepchildren and decided to have them killed.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.170
To save them, Nephele returned with a winged
ram with a golden fleece, who would fly them

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:29.309
to safety.

00:11:29.309 --> 00:11:34.029
The ram itself was the love child of Poseidon
when he had turned himself and his consort

00:11:34.029 --> 00:11:38.920
into golden rams so they could frolic in the
fields together without interruption.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.230
Phrixus and Helle escaped on the back of the
ram over the sea, but Helle was unable to

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.320
hold on and she fell to her death.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.040
Phrixus, though, made it safely to land in
modern day Georgia.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:55.029
Once safe, Phrixus sacrificed the ram to Poseidon,
and it became the constellation Aries.

00:11:55.029 --> 00:11:59.600
He took its fleece and hung it on an oak tree,
where it was defended by fire-breathing bulls,

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.600
and a magical dragon- the ones that Jason
had to vanquish whilst on his quest.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.649
