00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.160
The Bible predicts something called the Mark of the Beast.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.760
It says that this mark will be placed on people everywhere.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.780
In the days, just before Jesus returns.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.620
The Mark of the Beast is only mentioned in one place, in the entire Bible.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.620
Well, and parts of two chapter in the revelation of Jesus Christ.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.080
The last book of the Bible.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:36.400
The mark is described in the last few verses of the 13th chapter and first few verses of the 14th chapter.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.200
It is a mark which is placed in the right hand or on the forehead of people, all over the world.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.800
Without this mark, according to the prophecy, they can not buy or sell anything.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:01:00.660
The prophecy goes on to say, "that anyone who accepts that mark will receive the wrath of God without measure.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.900
So, it is considered to be pretty bad!

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:11.660
That phrase, "without measure", means the unmitigated, strongest possible, pure wrath of God.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.640
Accepting that mark is apparently the point of no return for the human soul.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.420
That is pretty scary stuff.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.260
And yet this mark is not referred to anywhere else in the Bible.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.920
Jesus never mentions it once, in any of the four gospels.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.820
Or does he?

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:38.280
I am going to show, in this video, how the mark of the beast connects with the ultimate Revelation of Jesus Christ

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.760
And how that Revelation starts in the four gospels and finishes in the last book of the Bible.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.500
The one called, "The Revelation of Jesus Christ".

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.880
But first, let us just forget about the Mark of the Beast.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.100
And take a grand overview of God's Revelation of himself to mankind, throughout history.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.780
There has been many ways that God has revealed himself to the human race.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.120
Not least of which, is the creation itself.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:19.060
The Universe and all that it contains. Right down to the tiniest atoms and molecules.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:27.640
Modern science has enabled us to appreciate more and more each day, just how vast the universe just is.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.160
As well as how intricate the tiniest particles are.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.320
Psalm 139 says, 'We are fearfully and wonderfully made.'

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.040
But in terms of understanding God's precise will for us, as human beings,

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:52.080
it is widely recognized that the 66 books of the Christian Bible represent the most comprehensive

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.960
and the most reliable evidence of God's plan for His creation.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:05.700
These books were written by many people from different times.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:16.980
But the best answer is found in the first four books of the New Testament.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.880
In those books we learn about Jesus; his life and his teachings.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.580
He is called the Christ; God in human form.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:39.600
Jesus showed the greatest love and wisdom that the world has ever seen.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:48.640
Jesus is also called the cornerstone.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:56.620
We need this piece to achieve our true purpose in life.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:07.840
If we look closer in the four gospels, we discover the Sermon on the Mount.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.220
It is a collection of the most important teachings of Jesus.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:21.280
This sermon is found in the 5th, 6th and 7th chapters of Matthew's Gospel.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.140
At the end of that great sermon,

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:33.940
Jesus says that anyone who does what he teaches will be building their life on a rock.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.140
Nothing will be able to shake them. Not even death.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:50.540
Though they will go through hard times, they will escape the wrath of God.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:57.000
They will find peace with God forever.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:06.860
Now let us look even closer to the corner of the cornerstone.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.440
In the middle of the Sermon on the Mount,

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.600
Jesus says,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.960
'Do not store treasures on earth,

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.400
where moths and rust destroys and thieves break through and steal.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.160
But store treasures in Heaven, where moth and rust cannot destroy it,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.040
and thieves cannot break in or steal it.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:42.260
Do not worry about your life, asking, "What will I eat?" or "What will I drink?" or "What will I wear?"

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.620
Is not life more than food and the body more than clothes?

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.280
Look at how flowers live.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.800
They have no jobs. They don't make clothes.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:06.020
But even King Solomon was not clothed like one of these flowers.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:13.880
Jesus then says his disciples will be different to other people in the world.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.580
We do not worry about material needs.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:24.800
Instead, we learn from Jesus how to: Live by faith.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:32.300
This is the central message of Jesus to the world.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:38.840
He says that our Creator never wanted us to trust money.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:46.640
He wants us to trust Him to provide our material needs.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:52.900
Yet this simple message has been missed by almost everyone.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:07:02.360
We say Jesus is the Son of God, but we live as though God does not even exist

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:09.640
only caring about money.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:21.800
In the 12th chapter of Matthew, Jesus mourns because the world refused to listen to him.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.900
Hardly anyone was prepared to trust him.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:35.780
He says, 'The Queen of the South will condemn that generation

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.840
Because she came from very far away to hear the wisdom of Solomon;

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:46.020
and now someone greater than Solomon is here.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:54.760
In both Chapter 6 and Chapter 12 of Matthew,

00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:04.460
Jesus says that he has something to offer that is greater than what Solomon had.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.660
So what did Solomon have to offer?

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:12.760
He built the first temple in Jerusalem;

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.060
a structure of great beauty and wealth.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:25.500
The records show that Solomon had tons of gold.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:33.640
But he's also famous for being the wisest man of that time.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:39.020
But Jesus has compared Solomon's wealth and Solomon's wisdom

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:45.440
with his own view of poverty and wisdom.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:51.300
Jesus compares the simplicity and beauty of birds and flowers

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:57.480
with all the silver and gold that Solomon had.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:05.380
Then Jesus mentions the 'Queen of the South'.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:12.660
The story of the Queen of Sheba appears twice in the Old Testament;

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:17.220
Once in 1 Kings 10

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:22.500
and once in 2 Chronicles 9.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:33.100
In this story, the Queen of Sheba gives Solomon more than four tons of gold to hear his great wisdom.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.140
She valued his wisdom that highly.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:48.020
Compared to that, what have we done with the wisdom of Jesus?

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:59.880
We have walked on it beneath our feet while we continue to seek wealth.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:09.880
Living by faith; Jesus also called it: Seeking God's kingdom and righteousness.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:16.280
He says that if we do that, instead of seeking more and more money,

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:23.080
our basic material needs will be supplied by God.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:33.960
And in the process, we will discover peace, happiness, and eternal life.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:47.260
This is the key message of the Sermon on the Mount, the teachings of Jesus and the Bible.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:59.960
So far, there has been no mention of the Mark of the Beast, has there?

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:06.920
So let's look closer at the book of Revelation.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:12.800
But I want to remind you that the proper title of that book is this:

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.100
The Revelation of Jesus Christ.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:28.000
So I'm looking for a link between the Sermon on the Mount and the book of Revelation.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.160
Here it is, in the 13th chapter of the Revelation:

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:38.460
'He (the Antichrist; the Beast; the Devil in human form),

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:47.720
causes all people to receive a mark in the right hand or in their forehead,

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.560
so that no one will be able to buy or sell

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:56.440
except those who have the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.520
Here is wisdom:

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:07.960
Let someone who has understanding count the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:14.240
His number is six hundred threescore and six (666).'

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:24.800
There's that word again: 'wisdom'. Jesus used the same word when he compared his wisdom with Solomon's.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.600
Solomon's wisdom led to great material wealth.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:35.220
But in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said,

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:42.620
'Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.'

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:45.920
Do you want wisdom? Real wisdom?

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:51.620
Jesus says that it can found in something that Solomon missed.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:56.560
Jesus' wisdom is the ultimate good stuff.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:05.780
And the Revelation says to study that number 666 to find out where all the ultimate bad stuff comes from.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:11.780
The prophecy has a clue. It says that 666 is the number of a man.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:20.240
Many years ago, I searched for that number 666 in the Bible.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:25.760
I thought that 666 might appear somewhere else in the Bible.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:34.380
In the Revelation, God urges us to study the number if we want to discover true wisdom.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:42.600
And sure enough, I found the number 666 in two other places in the Bible.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:47.340
I found it in the 10th chapter of 1 Kings.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:51.540
And I found it in the 9th chapter of 2 Chronicles.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:14:02.480
Jesus referred to the same chapters when he compared his wisdom with Solomon's.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:07.640
Almost the same words are used in both chapters:

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:18.160
'The amount of gold that came to Solomon was 666 talents of gold.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:23.860
That is about 25 tons of gold.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:30.720
Today, that would be over 8 billion US dollars.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:37.760
Solomon would have been one of the richest men who has ever lived, like Bill Gates.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:51.080
I believe that another great king in the earth will arise. The letters of his name will add up to 666 in Hebrew.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:15:08.180
But Jesus was hinting that the first form of that King was King Solomon.

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:13.700
What Jesus and the Mark of the Beast prophecy says about wisdom

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:19.500
both point to the same two chapters of the Bible.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:24.920
But Solomon seemed like a good man. He was the king of Israel.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:31.980
He even wrote three books of the Bible.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:36.360
But is Solomon the Son of God?

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:43.540
If we want to find true wisdom, we must not just follow 'good men'.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:49.760
We must follow Jesus, the Word made Flesh.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:56.120
In many churches, there is a false belief that God wants us to be rich.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.440
Where did it come from?

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.940
Did it not come from Solomon's so-called wisdom?

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:10.060
Those churches rejected Jesus' blessings on the poor.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:16.360
And they believe that buying and owning lots of nice things is a good thing.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.040
But this only shows that their spirit is empty.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.520
Their belief is demonic.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:29.260
They have replaced Jesus with Solomon.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:33.560
They have crucified Jesus so that they can be rich.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:43.820
But in the end, they are left with ashes.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:50.640
They have no joy or peace because they always want more and more wealth.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:58.480
They are in the grip of the Devil just waiting to receive his Mark.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.060
Yes, Jesus predicted the mark of the beast.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.220
But he did more than that.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:11.400
Through his life, he taught us how to live without the mark.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.580
He tells us to be content with food and clothing.

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:21.640
He wants us to tell the whole world about God's blessings on the poor.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:27.640
6Brothers and sisters, we are getting ready for Jesus' glorious return.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:32.640
But first we must go through great, great trouble.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:38.500
We will need God's strength and wisdom.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:43.580
And we must live on the solid rock of His teachings.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:47.680
Even so, come, Lord Jesus.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.880
Amen.
