00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.102
The President: Okay, go ahead.

00:00:02.102 --> 00:00:03.870
Who's going to make the
first presentation?

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.238
I want to buy something.

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:07.140
(laughter)

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.309
But only if it's Made
in America, right?

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:10.343
(laughter)

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:11.745
Well, I want to
thank you all.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:16.750
(applause)

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:21.488
And Michael was a
supporter of ours right

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:23.056
from the beginning, which
I really appreciate.

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:23.957
It's good to see you here.

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:27.594
It's fantastic, and I
actually bought a couple

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.529
of pillows, and
they're very good.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.864
I have to tell you,
they're great.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:31.531
(laughter)

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.166
I've slept so much
better ever since.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:33.833
(laughter)

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.870
Thank you very
much Michael.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.806
Good afternoon, and
welcome to the White House.

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:41.941
We're here today to
continue our celebration

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:46.679
of American manufacturing
as part of Made in America Week.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.082
The leaders and innovators
around this table create

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:52.252
the products that fill our
homes, defend our nation,

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:56.089
and enrich our lives, and
each one of these products

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.759
proudly carries the
label Made in the U. S. A.

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:02.495
Do you remember in the old
days we used to say Made

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:03.163
in the U. S.

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:07.100
A.? That was when we
really had a great pride

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.805
in our product, and you do
but, unfortunately, we've

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:14.574
lost a little something,
but we're gaining it back

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:15.241
very quickly.

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.877
You see the stock
market hit a new high.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:20.513
Jobs are the lowest
they've been, the best

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:24.551
jobs report we've had
in I think 16 years.

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:26.986
Unemployment numbers
fantastic, how we're

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:29.322
doing, but we're also
going to take care of the

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:32.792
95 million people out
there that aren't working,

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:35.061
and we have to remember
that's not really part

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:35.929
of the statistic.

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.765
I've been talking about
that for a long time.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.800
And when we got those
great reports I kept

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.470
saying, you know, those
numbers, whether it's 4.2,

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.106
4.3: I said for a long
time they don't matter,

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:49.242
but now I accept those
numbers very proudly.

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:50.743
I say they do matter.

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:53.012
But we're doing very well
with the jobs and the job

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:55.415
reports and we're doing
very well with companies.

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:56.749
We're really moving along.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.985
From day one my
administration has been

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:03.122
fighting to bring back our
manufacturing jobs, and to

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:06.159
crack down on foreign
countries that cheat,

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.560
a lot of them.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.196
We will end the theft of
American prosperity, and

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:12.832
we will stand up for our
companies, our factories,

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:13.533
and our workers.

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:14.701
Is that okay
with you Michael?

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:15.935
Good?

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:17.170
(applause)

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.874
Michael Lindell:
(inaudible)

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:24.611
The President:
Made in America is more

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:27.680
than a label or a product,
and it's just something so

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.249
important to us.

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:30.917
It's a stamp
of excellence.

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:33.119
It's a badge of honor
and a tribute to the

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:36.856
tremendous skill of the
working men and women who

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:39.659
design and build these
incredible masterpieces

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.629
and different
products of all types.

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.998
When American workers have
a level playing field,

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:47.133
they cannot be beaten.

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:50.370
They have not had a level
playing field in a long

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.773
time, but you see
what's happening.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:58.378
Step-by-step we've gotten
rid of regulations and a

00:02:58.378 --> 00:02:59.312
lot more are coming.

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:01.381
We have some statutory
requirements where we're

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:04.551
not allowed to do it until
certain dates, but they're

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:06.920
coming as fast as
those dates come.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.888
We've opened it up and
it's made a big difference

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:11.558
for the farmer, for the
homebuilder, for so many,

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:13.493
and for the manufacturers.

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:15.762
That's why we want to
ensure the integrity of

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:17.330
the Made in America label.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.599
My administration is
committed to working with

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.869
the private sector to
ensure the protection of

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.872
Made in America and the
label through efforts like

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:29.542
certification, greater
transparency, and stricter

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:32.478
enforcement efforts by
agencies like the Federal

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:34.280
Trade Commission.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.550
We will have zero
tolerance for illegal

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.119
counterfeiting, piracy,
theft, or intellectual

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:44.290
property and they really:
they take our intellectual

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.926
property like we're
a bunch of babies.

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:50.630
But no longer, and false
claims that a product is

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.602
Made in America and, as
time goes by, the value of

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:57.704
Made in America is going
to be greater and greater.

00:03:57.704 --> 00:04:00.139
So you're going to see
more and more of this.

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.975
There was a time when
people didn't want to use

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:03.843
that name, and they
wouldn't take that name.

00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:06.446
Now they're taking it,
and that's because we've

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:09.616
become very proud
of it again.

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:12.485
Around the world the Made
in America label is the

00:04:12.485 --> 00:04:14.787
gold standard for
craftsmanship, quality,

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:18.224
and artistry, and that is
one more reason why we

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:19.359
have to protect it.

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.464
I mean, we have to protect
it, not for you, not for

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:27.233
me, but for your children,
for your grandchildren,

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:29.002
because that's
what happening.

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:34.307
So we must protect it from
illegal theft and from abuse.

00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:37.644
Made in America movement
is growing rapidly under

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:40.947
my administration, and
we're more determined than

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:44.951
ever to protect our jobs,
our industry, and our workers.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:49.022
Every day we are putting
America first and, as you

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:52.959
know, during our
campaign I had a slogan.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.494
A few of you may
have heard it.

00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:57.697
It's called Make
America Great Again.

00:04:57.697 --> 00:04:59.032
Did you ever
hear that slogan?

00:04:59.032 --> 00:04:59.699
I think so.

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:00.800
Mike has.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.770
(applause)

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.307
And I want to thank
our great Michael.

00:05:08.307 --> 00:05:10.576
Thank you Michael for
being here, by the way,

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:14.514
and Secretary Acosta is
here, and you have done a

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:17.684
fantastic job in a very
short period of time, and

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:19.452
I know you're going to say
a few words, so why don't

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:20.119
you go ahead?

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:21.421
Thank you Mr. Secretary.

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:24.223
Secretary Alex Acosta:
Mr. President, thank you,

00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:25.625
and thank you for
your leadership.

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:30.963
While we were waiting for
you to walk in, we had

00:05:30.963 --> 00:05:34.500
short conversations, and I
just wanted to tell you a

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.771
few things that I heard
from your guests here today.

00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:41.107
American workers are
the best in the world.

00:05:41.107 --> 00:05:43.409
American workers
are passionate.

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:46.079
Made in America matters
because when products are

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:50.183
Made in America, Americans
care about what they're doing.

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:52.018
They care about the
products because they know

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:56.522
the product impacts
American lives, and so

00:05:56.522 --> 00:06:00.493
those are examples of what
your guests here told me,

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:03.830
and I think examples of
why Made in America is so

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.034
important to this nation,
to the economy, and to

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:08.868
this nation's workers.

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:11.104
And so thank you for your
leadership on this issue.

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:12.672
President Donald Trump:
Thank you very much.

00:06:12.672 --> 00:06:15.875
So what label do you like
better: Made in America or

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:18.511
Made in the
U.S.A.? Tell me.

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:19.679
Think about it.

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:20.346
Male Speaker: U.S.A.

00:06:20.346 --> 00:06:21.714
President Donald Trump:
What do you like better:

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:23.316
Made in America or
Made in the U.S.A.?

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:24.650
Male Speaker:
Made in the U.S.A.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.985
Male Speaker:
Made in the U.S.A.

00:06:25.985 --> 00:06:27.320
President Donald Trump:
What do you like?

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.987
Secretary, how you feel?

00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:29.322
Secretary Alex Acosta: I
think Made in America is

00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:29.989
what we've been
talking about.

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:31.324
It's known throughout the world, and Made in America works.

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:32.692
President Donald Trump:
It used to be Made in the

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:33.359
U.S.A., I think,
the label.

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:38.364
It was on a car.

00:06:44.504 --> 00:06:46.105
You know, they were
telling me that in

00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:49.342
Czechoslovakia and other
communist countries many

00:06:49.342 --> 00:06:53.412
years ago they were so
proud of a car if it was

00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:54.580
made in the United States.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.617
They used to take a single
dollar, and they'd scotch

00:06:57.617 --> 00:07:00.586
tape it up to their
windshield, just to show

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:04.490
an American dollar, and
that was a long time ago.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.593
But that's what they
used to do, and maybe

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:09.562
somebody's going to be
doing that in the future.

00:07:09.562 --> 00:07:10.763
How do you feel Michael?

00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:11.464
Made in the U.S.A.

00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:12.131
or Made in America?

00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:16.636
Mike Lindell: I feel Made
in the U.S.A., but I've

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:19.906
done both, but my ads are
all Made in the U.S.A.

00:07:19.906 --> 00:07:20.573
(inaudible).

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:21.841
That's the way I feel.

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:22.842
I just --

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:24.644
The President:
How many pillows did you

00:07:24.644 --> 00:07:25.778
make last year in the USA?

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:26.445
Mike Lindell: Ten million.

00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:27.780
The President:
That's, I mean, can you imagine?

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.148
Mike Lindell: Last year:
thirty million so far.

00:07:29.148 --> 00:07:29.816
(laughter)

00:07:29.816 --> 00:07:31.184
The President:
Thirty million since --

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:33.953
that's fantastic.

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:34.821
I know it's amazing.

00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:35.855
I heard it's amazing.

00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:36.689
Peter, what do you like?

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:40.359
Peter Navarro: I love Made
in America because it fits

00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:43.196
in with our Buy American,
Hire American, the two

00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:45.097
simple rules of the
Trump administration.

00:07:45.097 --> 00:07:47.900
The President:
Okay, what does the media

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.568
like?

00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:51.470
Do you like Made in
America or Made in the

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.138
U.S.A.

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:52.805
Steve?

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:53.472
What do you like?

00:07:53.472 --> 00:07:55.341
Made in America or
Made in the U.S.A.?

00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:56.876
Male Speaker: (inaudible)

00:07:56.876 --> 00:07:59.545
President Donald
Trump: Either way.

00:07:59.545 --> 00:08:00.913
They're so quiet
all of a sudden.

00:08:00.913 --> 00:08:02.048
(laughter)

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:04.851
The President:
Well, you make your

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:06.419
decision.

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:08.487
I think specifically
Made in the U.S.A.

00:08:08.487 --> 00:08:11.457
was what they had,
Made in the U.S.A.

00:08:11.457 --> 00:08:13.726
But either is
great or both.

00:08:13.726 --> 00:08:15.828
I mean, you could really
go both, although I think

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:17.597
we're probably like to --
what do you like Mike?

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:19.232
The Vice President:
I like Made in America.

00:08:19.232 --> 00:08:21.200
That's just what I've
always thought and, you

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.168
know, make America
great again.

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:23.936
You've got to make it in
America, and I like that.

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:25.238
I like (inaudible).

00:08:25.238 --> 00:08:26.572
The President:
Okay, good, very good.

00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:27.907
Are you going to
show me some things?

00:08:27.907 --> 00:08:28.674
Let's go.

00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:31.077
Do you want to
start Michael?

00:08:31.077 --> 00:08:31.844
Mike Lindell.

00:08:31.844 --> 00:08:32.511
(inaudible)

00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:33.880
The President:
I think they're going to

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:34.547
show some of the product.

00:08:34.547 --> 00:08:35.715
Mike Lindell.

00:08:35.715 --> 00:08:37.450
Oh, yeah, okay.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.485
Well, this is My Pillow.

00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:44.357
I have over 1,500
employees now and I'm very

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:47.293
proud that every part,
even the cotton is grown

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:52.131
in the U.S.A., and my call
center is right outside my door.

00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:56.135
I think that's another
thing: having all of them

00:08:56.135 --> 00:08:56.802
employed here.

00:08:56.802 --> 00:08:57.970
Everyone has a passion.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.206
It's like a family when
you have everybody

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:04.076
employed here and I'll
tell you: the businesses

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:05.912
-- I had a thing once
where I heard a snowmobile

00:09:05.912 --> 00:09:08.981
company that left the
United States for overseas.

00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:10.983
Do you know how many
companies followed that company?

00:09:10.983 --> 00:09:12.652
You have the bolts that
make the bolts, the

00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:16.188
fasteners, the seats; all
these things, and with my

00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:19.692
pillow, with any companies
made here, you affect so

00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:20.693
many other companies.

00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:21.827
So it just spreads.

00:09:21.827 --> 00:09:22.728
It's just amazing.

00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:24.063
President Donald
Trump: Great job.

00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:24.730
I'm proud of you.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.465
Eric Paulsen:
Representative Eric

00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:28.801
Paulsen from Minnesota,
and I sleep on a My Pillow

00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:30.636
every night, and I
have the privilege --

00:09:30.636 --> 00:09:31.304
(laughter)

00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:33.406
-- of representing a lot
of Michael's workers right

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:34.073
home in Minnesota.

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:35.808
The President:
And a great representative too.

00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:37.810
Stephanie MacDonald: Good
afternoon Mr. President.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.146
My name is Stephanie
MacDonald, and I am the

00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:42.014
cofounder of
Authenticity 50.

00:09:42.014 --> 00:09:46.018
We are the only company
making 100 percent seed to

00:09:46.018 --> 00:09:48.187
stitch lux bedding
here in America.

00:09:48.187 --> 00:09:48.854
As we like to
say, here we go.

00:09:48.854 --> 00:09:52.258
As we like to say, we're
bringing it back to

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:57.196
America one sheet set at a
time, and we sure do hope

00:09:57.196 --> 00:09:59.365
to have our bedding in
the white house one day.

00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:00.066
(laughter)

00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:02.735
The President: It
sounds like a very good idea.

00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:05.705
Jimmy MacDonald: And
I'm Jimmy Mac Donald.

00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:08.808
I'm the other cofounder of
Authenticity 50, but let's

00:10:08.808 --> 00:10:10.343
be honest: she's the boss.

00:10:10.343 --> 00:10:11.010
(laughter)

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.479
I've learned that much.

00:10:13.479 --> 00:10:17.683
David Costello: Mr.
President, Mr. Vice

00:10:17.683 --> 00:10:19.552
President, Secretary
Acosta, thank you so much

00:10:19.552 --> 00:10:20.219
for doing this.

00:10:20.219 --> 00:10:22.321
This is a remarkable
event, and it's showing

00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:24.824
true leadership in making
America great again.

00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:26.425
We really appreciate
what you're doing.

00:10:26.425 --> 00:10:27.760
I'm David Costello.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.628
I serve as the executive
director of the Warrior

00:10:29.628 --> 00:10:31.564
Protection and
Readiness Coalition.

00:10:31.564 --> 00:10:33.833
We are the companies and
manufacturers of your body

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:35.835
armor, your ballistic
helmets, your combat

00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:38.537
clothing, your combat
boots for our armed

00:10:38.537 --> 00:10:42.274
forces, and all of that is
100 percent American made

00:10:42.274 --> 00:10:43.776
from the fiber forward.

00:10:43.776 --> 00:10:46.612
So we employ thousands of
people around the United

00:10:46.612 --> 00:10:49.281
States, in every state in
this nation, and one of

00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:51.050
the things we want to talk
about today is the federal

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.020
government does not buy
all American made products

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.488
in some of the agencies.

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:57.823
We're working with Doctor
Navarro on an effort where

00:10:57.823 --> 00:10:59.925
to get to the Department
of Homeland Security to

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:01.560
buy American-made
products.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.096
This is a border
patrol uniform that's

00:11:04.096 --> 00:11:07.500
manufactured in Mexico,
and we think perhaps it

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.235
might be a better idea to
have these made in the

00:11:09.235 --> 00:11:10.369
United States.

00:11:10.369 --> 00:11:11.704
President Donald
Trump: Thank you.

00:11:11.704 --> 00:11:12.772
Thank you very much.

00:11:12.772 --> 00:11:14.840
Matt Colligan: My name
is Matt Colligan,

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.142
out of Hudson, Ohio.

00:11:16.142 --> 00:11:18.811
I own a leaf filter
gutter protection.

00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:22.615
We manufacture and install
leaf filter gutter protection.

00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:25.317
So it keeps all the leaves
and debris out of your gutters.

00:11:25.317 --> 00:11:29.155
So we employ over 1,300
people out of 38 offices

00:11:29.155 --> 00:11:31.957
all over the country, and
they also wanted me to

00:11:31.957 --> 00:11:34.193
mention that I
own a NASCAR team.

00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:36.729
So I don't know anything
more American than leaf

00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:38.097
filter gutter
protection and NASCAR.

00:11:38.097 --> 00:11:38.764
(laughter)

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:40.800
The President:
So let me ask you.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.269
The width of a gutter
changes a little bit so

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:44.103
you make different widths?

00:11:44.103 --> 00:11:45.371
Matt Colligan:
It does change.

00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:46.038
So we've --

00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:47.540
The President: So
what does it go to: small

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.340
side, big side?

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.475
What does it go
to on a house?

00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:50.810
Matt Colligan: We do three
inch and then it goes up

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:51.477
to eight inches.

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:53.979
So one of the things we're
doing is we're developing

00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:58.851
new products to be able
to fit some of the gutter

00:11:58.851 --> 00:12:00.086
styles up in
the Northwest.

00:12:00.086 --> 00:12:02.955
I have an office up in
Seattle, but as far as

00:12:02.955 --> 00:12:05.291
like Oregon and Northern
California, we're not able

00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:07.860
to go there yet just
because of our product

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.195
doesn't fit those
type of gutters.

00:12:09.195 --> 00:12:10.996
But we're developing
products.

00:12:10.996 --> 00:12:13.199
We manufacture our
products out of Plainwell,

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:15.167
Michigan, which is north
of Kalamazoo, and we're

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:17.369
going to open a plant down
in Louisville, Kentucky.

00:12:17.369 --> 00:12:21.073
The President:
That's great; two great places.

00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:21.740
Thank you very much.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.908
Matt Colligan: Thank you.

00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:24.610
Mark Gracey [spelled
phonetically]: Thank you

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:25.277
Mr. President.

00:12:25.277 --> 00:12:27.279
My name is Mark Gracey,
president and founder of

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:28.614
Bully Tools [spelled
phonetically].

00:12:28.614 --> 00:12:30.316
We manufacture rakes,
shovels, hoes.

00:12:30.316 --> 00:12:33.052
We have a product line
of about 200 products.

00:12:33.052 --> 00:12:35.654
Our first factory is
in Steubenville, Ohio.

00:12:35.654 --> 00:12:38.190
We're about to announce in
the next couple of months

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.026
the opening of a second
factory, location

00:12:41.026 --> 00:12:42.495
to be finalized.

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:45.531
I'm feeling a little bit
like Forrest Gump today

00:12:45.531 --> 00:12:47.399
with a clip posted
on Facebook.

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:49.768
I was here on Monday
as well, so I've been posting.

00:12:49.768 --> 00:12:52.905
I feel like Forrest Gump,
I'm back in the White

00:12:52.905 --> 00:12:53.639
House again.

00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:54.306
(laughter)

00:12:54.306 --> 00:12:55.641
President Donald
Trump: That's great.

00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:56.308
(laughter)

00:12:56.308 --> 00:12:57.643
So is business better
since we got elected,

00:12:57.643 --> 00:12:58.644
since November 8?

00:12:58.644 --> 00:13:01.680
Mark Gracey: My confidence
in the future is much

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.949
stronger under this
administration, and that's

00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:07.386
why I'm investing in
opening up a second factory.

00:13:07.386 --> 00:13:08.053
The President:That's great.

00:13:08.053 --> 00:13:08.754
A lot of people feel that.

00:13:08.754 --> 00:13:11.490
Mark Gracey: And by the
way, with stepping on his

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:16.328
message, if the GSA would
stop buying foreign-made

00:13:16.328 --> 00:13:18.230
shovels, maybe I'd
open a third factory.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:19.565
The President:
Well, we're going to have

00:13:19.565 --> 00:13:20.232
to look at that.

00:13:20.232 --> 00:13:20.900
That's a good point.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:21.634
Absolutely.

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.602
Mark Gracey: And
years ago I applied --

00:13:23.602 --> 00:13:24.970
The President:
Let's look at that Peter.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.505
Peter Navarro: That's
why we're here today.

00:13:26.505 --> 00:13:28.407
The President:
Okay, good, thank you.

00:13:28.407 --> 00:13:29.074
Go ahead.

00:13:29.074 --> 00:13:31.010
Sara Irvani: Hello, my
name is Sara Irvani.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.345
I'm CEO of
Okabashi Brands.

00:13:33.345 --> 00:13:36.749
We're an American-made
footwear company, and we

00:13:36.749 --> 00:13:39.585
actually make the most
comfortable flip-flops and

00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:42.521
sandals, and welcome
you all to try a pair.

00:13:42.521 --> 00:13:44.190
And we're based in
Buford, Georgia.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.492
The President:
Thank you very much: beautiful.

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:51.397
Kimberly Falconhand : Hi,
I'm Kimberly Falconhand.

00:13:51.397 --> 00:13:53.933
I'm the president
of Okabashi Brands.

00:13:53.933 --> 00:13:56.468
So I'm the other half of
the tag team here, so also

00:13:56.468 --> 00:13:58.103
representing the most
comfortable flip-flops.

00:13:58.103 --> 00:13:59.772
The President:
Thank you very much.

00:13:59.772 --> 00:14:02.308
Claudia Tenney: Thank
you Mr. President.

00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:05.211
I'm Representative Claudia
Tenney from upstate New

00:14:05.211 --> 00:14:07.379
York, a fellow New Yorker.

00:14:07.379 --> 00:14:09.682
We are so grateful for
your leadership and that

00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:11.784
you are the president
and our first Republican

00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:13.953
President since
Teddy Roosevelt.

00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:16.755
I want to tell you I had
the great fortune of

00:14:16.755 --> 00:14:19.191
touring Sherrill
Manufacturing last year, a

00:14:19.191 --> 00:14:21.694
factory that was taken
over by these two

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:23.028
phenomenal entrepreneurs,
and at your inaugural

00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:24.363
speech I listened and
I wrote down something

00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:25.064
really important
that you said.

00:14:25.064 --> 00:14:26.398
You said, "Americans know
a different reality as

00:14:26.398 --> 00:14:27.733
they see rusted out
factories scattered like

00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:29.068
tombstones across the
landscape," and I typed it

00:14:29.068 --> 00:14:30.402
in on my cell phone
because we couldn't have

00:14:30.402 --> 00:14:35.407
any papers out there, and
I thought this is exactly

00:14:42.848 --> 00:14:44.683
what we have at
Sherrill Manufacturing.

00:14:44.683 --> 00:14:47.953
And these two gentlemen
are the only flatware

00:14:47.953 --> 00:14:49.288
manufacturer in the
nation, and they have been

00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:50.656
approved for contracting,
but I want to just say

00:14:50.656 --> 00:14:51.991
that I do have a bill that
I've put in that we'd love

00:14:51.991 --> 00:14:53.859
to have your support on.

00:14:53.859 --> 00:14:54.560
It's called
the Spoons Act.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.961
It took a little work
to come up with that.

00:14:55.961 --> 00:14:57.296
It's support procurement
of our nation's

00:14:57.296 --> 00:14:57.963
Stainless Steel Act.

00:14:57.963 --> 00:14:58.631
The President:Good.

00:14:58.631 --> 00:14:59.999
Claudia Tenney: And now
we'd love to have your

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:01.834
support so we can
continue to have --

00:15:01.834 --> 00:15:05.337
The President:
Good, I'll look at that.

00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:07.840
Claudia Tenney: --
Sherrill Manufacturing

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.276
thrive and we'd love to
have you visit Sherrill.

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:12.144
There was a parking lot
with over 2,400 cars that

00:15:12.144 --> 00:15:13.479
were once Oneida employees
and there's a lot of room

00:15:13.479 --> 00:15:14.146
there for Marine
One to land.

00:15:14.146 --> 00:15:14.813
The President:That's great.

00:15:14.813 --> 00:15:15.481
Thank you.

00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:16.148
Claudia Tenney: Thank you.

00:15:16.148 --> 00:15:16.815
We'd love to
have you there.

00:15:16.815 --> 00:15:17.483
Thank you so much.

00:15:17.483 --> 00:15:18.817
I'm grateful to the
vice president as well.

00:15:18.817 --> 00:15:19.485
The President:Thank you.

00:15:19.485 --> 00:15:20.152
Claudia Tenney: Thank you.

00:15:20.152 --> 00:15:21.520
Greg Owens: Thank you very
much for the invitation.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.855
My name is Greg Owens,
and this is Matt Roberts.

00:15:22.855 --> 00:15:24.189
We are cofounders,
president and the CEO of

00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:24.857
Sherrill Manufacturing.

00:15:24.857 --> 00:15:25.524
Our brand is
Liberty Tabletop.

00:15:25.524 --> 00:15:26.191
We sell flatware.

00:15:26.191 --> 00:15:27.526
We are the only flatware
manufacturer

00:15:27.526 --> 00:15:28.193
in the United States.

00:15:28.193 --> 00:15:29.561
The President:
That's incredible.

00:15:29.561 --> 00:15:30.229
What happened?

00:15:30.229 --> 00:15:31.563
Greg Owens: Well,
everybody else went

00:15:31.563 --> 00:15:32.231
overseas, chasing
cheap labor.

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:32.898
The President:
That's terrible.

00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:34.233
I'm not surprised, but
it is really somewhat

00:15:34.233 --> 00:15:35.567
surprising when
you say the only.

00:15:35.567 --> 00:15:36.235
That's a hell
of a statement.

00:15:36.235 --> 00:15:37.603
Greg Owens: And our slogan
is 100 percent

00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:39.238
Made in America.

00:15:39.238 --> 00:15:40.973
The President:
Yeah, that's great.

00:15:40.973 --> 00:15:44.643
Greg Owens: So
we like that.

00:15:44.643 --> 00:15:48.914
We use American steel
melted and manufactured

00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:52.618
right here in the
United States.

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:54.286
The President:Great job.

00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:56.155
Mike, would you like
to say something,

00:15:56.155 --> 00:15:57.456
vice president?

00:15:57.456 --> 00:16:03.362
The Vice President : Well, thank you

00:16:03.362 --> 00:16:05.064
Mr. President.

00:16:05.064 --> 00:16:10.069
I just wanted to welcome
all these great job

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:15.374
creators and
entrepreneurs.

00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:19.011
I think you all can tell
that this country has a

00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:22.548
President who loves people
who make things and who

00:16:22.548 --> 00:16:26.552
grow things, and I just
want to assure you that

00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:30.422
whatever we call it, Made
in America, is not a slogan.

00:16:30.422 --> 00:16:32.725
It's a mission for this
President and this

00:16:32.725 --> 00:16:35.761
administration, and we're
not going to stop until we

00:16:35.761 --> 00:16:38.230
make Made in
America great again.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:41.133
The President:Thank you Mike.

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:43.569
Carter Beard: Mr.
President, Mr. Vice

00:16:43.569 --> 00:16:46.505
President, Doctor Navarro,
Secretary Acosta, thank

00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:47.639
you for having me here.

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:48.674
I'm Carter Beard.

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:51.310
I'm the president and CEO
of Annin Flag Makers.

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:53.479
We make American flags,
state, and international

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:54.513
flags.

00:16:54.513 --> 00:16:57.883
We were founded in New
York City in 1847.

00:16:57.883 --> 00:17:00.252
I'm the sixth
generation president.

00:17:00.252 --> 00:17:03.655
We have approximately
700 employee flag makers

00:17:03.655 --> 00:17:06.225
making our product and our
factories in South Boston,

00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:10.195
Virginia, Cobbs Creek,
Virginia, Shockton, Ohio,

00:17:10.195 --> 00:17:11.563
and Gilladdsville
[spelled phonetically],

00:17:11.563 --> 00:17:13.165
Pennsylvania, just a few
miles from the Hill School

00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:13.832
in Pottstown.

00:17:13.832 --> 00:17:15.167
The President:
That's a good school.

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:17.403
By the way, we have the
governor of Indiana here.

00:17:17.403 --> 00:17:18.237
Where is Eric?

00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:19.538
Where is he?

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:21.306
He's around
here somewhere.

00:17:21.306 --> 00:17:22.608
There he is.

00:17:22.608 --> 00:17:23.275
(applause)

00:17:23.275 --> 00:17:24.376
Can't miss him.

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:25.244
Great job.

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:27.446
You're doing a great job.

00:17:27.446 --> 00:17:28.747
Thank you Eric.

00:17:28.747 --> 00:17:31.550
Margarita Mendoza: Good

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.551
Mr. Vice President.

00:17:32.551 --> 00:17:34.753
Thank you so much for
declaring this week Made

00:17:34.753 --> 00:17:37.089
in America Week, and
helping to celebrate the

00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:38.757
small brands making

00:17:38.757 --> 00:17:40.726
My name is
Margarita Mendoza.

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:43.395
I am the founder of the
Made in America movement,

00:17:43.395 --> 00:17:46.265
and we believe in order
for Americans to make it

00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:48.767
in America we have to
make it in America.

00:17:48.767 --> 00:17:49.435
Thank you.

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:50.769
The President:
Thank you very much.

00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:52.704
Kurt Uhlir: Thank you

00:17:52.704 --> 00:17:53.472
Mr. President.

00:17:53.472 --> 00:17:54.306
My name is Kurt Uhlir.

00:17:54.306 --> 00:17:55.808
I'm the chairman of the
Made in America movement,

00:17:55.808 --> 00:17:59.445
and it's an honor to be
part of not just this

00:17:59.445 --> 00:18:02.481
organization, but your
movement you have here.

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:04.950
We represent 20,000
American-made companies:

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.919
the mothers, the fathers
that work for those

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:08.754
companies, and we're
honored to do that and to

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:10.155
be here today.

00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:12.925
The President:
Thank you, great job.

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:15.260
Frank Lucas: Mr.
President, Congressman

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.663
Frank Lucas, third
district of Oklahoma.

00:18:17.663 --> 00:18:18.464
The President:Yes, hi Frank.

00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:20.399
Frank Lucas: I represent
Robert here and I work for

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:23.235
him, and we are known
as Americans around the world.

00:18:23.235 --> 00:18:25.838
So, once we reclaim our
markets at home, we need

00:18:25.838 --> 00:18:27.773
to move our American
products into the world

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:28.440
again too.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.775
The President:
Right, thank you Frank.

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:30.876

(inaudible) New
York for the Silver.

00:18:39.485 --> 00:18:41.153
I hope for working on one.

00:18:41.153 --> 00:18:43.555
We just got back from a
Made in America event two

00:18:43.555 --> 00:18:45.257
weeks ago at Wal-Mart
where they turned our

00:18:45.257 --> 00:18:50.162
company from 200,000
coasters to 212,000 a month.

00:18:50.162 --> 00:18:52.731
So they're doing a great
job with Made in America

00:18:52.731 --> 00:18:56.401
as well, and we're just
delighted to be here.

00:18:56.401 --> 00:18:57.736
We're out of
Stillwater, Oklahoma.

00:18:57.736 --> 00:18:59.104
The President:
Well, thank you very much.

00:18:59.104 --> 00:18:59.771
Great to have you.

00:18:59.771 --> 00:19:01.106

Greg Maguire
from Revision.

00:19:01.773 --> 00:19:08.380
I'd like to thank you very
much for your support of

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.582
American manufacturers,
and Mr. Vice President,

00:19:10.582 --> 00:19:14.586
Secretary Acosta, Doctor
Navarro, and we really do

00:19:14.586 --> 00:19:15.320
appreciate that.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.656
I'd like to
introduce our CEO.

00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:19.291
John Blanche: Thank
you Mr. President.

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:20.425
It's great to be here.

My name is John Blanche.

00:19:21.527 --> 00:19:23.729
I'm the founder and CEO of
a company

00:19:23.729 --> 00:19:25.130
called Revision Military.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.165
We are the developers,
designers, and

00:19:27.165 --> 00:19:29.101
manufacturers of the
world's best protective

00:19:29.101 --> 00:19:32.037
equipment for the world's
best military and law

00:19:32.037 --> 00:19:33.405
enforcement globally.

00:19:33.405 --> 00:19:35.908
Recently we won the U.S.

00:19:35.908 --> 00:19:38.143
Army contract for the
next generation helmet.

00:19:38.143 --> 00:19:41.179
This is 24 percent lighter
weight than the current helmet.

00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:44.216
We think it's going to
save a lot of lives.

00:19:44.216 --> 00:19:46.351
It's a real
pleasure to be here.

00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:48.186
The President:
Thank you very much.

00:19:48.186 --> 00:19:50.022

afternoon Mr. President.

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:51.990
It's a pleasure

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.958
My name is Matt Bell.

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:54.927
I'm from Northeast
Pellets.

00:19:54.927 --> 00:19:58.030
We're located in
rural Ashland, Maine.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:02.334
We manufacture wood
pellets for heating, for

00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:05.337
residential, commercial,
and institutional heating.

00:20:05.337 --> 00:20:09.474
They're available in 25,
40 pound bags, as well as

00:20:09.474 --> 00:20:11.710
one ton sacks
and loose bulk.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:15.948
We have a 40 pound bag
here on display, and all

00:20:15.948 --> 00:20:18.517
of our fiber is purchased
from local sawmills right

00:20:18.517 --> 00:20:19.952
in the greater
Ashland area.

00:20:19.952 --> 00:20:21.853
The President:Thank you.

00:20:21.853 --> 00:20:24.389

00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:26.825
Sean Bandawat : Mr.
President, Mr. Vice

00:20:26.825 --> 00:20:29.661
President, I'm Sean
Bandawat, president of the

00:20:29.661 --> 00:20:32.464
Bromwell Company,
based in Los Angeles.

00:20:32.464 --> 00:20:34.366
We are the oldest
manufacturer of

00:20:34.366 --> 00:20:36.201
kitchenware and houseware
products in the United

00:20:36.201 --> 00:20:39.237
States, founded in 1819.

00:20:39.237 --> 00:20:41.573
We produce a full line
of handcrafted copper

00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:45.310
products like this copper
cup, and a full line of

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:47.079
kitchenware and bakeware
items, including

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:52.784
colanders, frying pans,
cookie sheets, and more.

00:20:52.784 --> 00:20:54.653
We have two manufacturing
facilities: one in

00:20:54.653 --> 00:20:58.724
Vermont, and one in
Indiana, and as a company

00:20:58.724 --> 00:21:00.626
that's been in business
for 200 years, it's

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:03.862
estimated that one in four
American households owns a

00:21:03.862 --> 00:21:04.596
Bromwell product.

00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:07.299
The President:
Thank you, and Mike Kelly

00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:10.736
our friend, and 1819:
that's a pretty old

00:21:10.736 --> 00:21:11.403
company.

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:12.337
What do you think Mike?

00:21:12.337 --> 00:21:13.405
Mike Kelly: I'll
tell you what.

00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:15.040
These are all great
manufacturers.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.876
The President:
These are great people.

00:21:17.876 --> 00:21:19.211
Mike Kelly: These
are great Americans.

00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:19.878
Absolutely.

00:21:19.878 --> 00:21:21.246
Yeah, Mr. President, it's
so good to be with you

00:21:21.246 --> 00:21:22.581
again, and I know with
Vice President Pence: we

00:21:22.581 --> 00:21:23.915
sat together my first
term in Congress.

00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:25.250
I was on foreign
affairs with him.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:26.585
But I had the best time
of my life in all the 69

00:21:26.585 --> 00:21:28.987
years was the summer of
last year when we got to

00:21:28.987 --> 00:21:31.423
campaign and we rocked
the Keystone state.

00:21:31.423 --> 00:21:32.424
You were able to do --

00:21:32.424 --> 00:21:33.091
(applause)

00:21:33.091 --> 00:21:35.127
The President:Thank you.

00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:40.232
Mike Kelly: -- we
brought her home.

00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:41.133
I've got to tell you.

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:43.268
What you are able to do
was absolutely incredible.

00:21:43.268 --> 00:21:46.438
And so I brought with
me today a piece of

00:21:46.438 --> 00:21:47.205
legislation.

00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:48.540
This is a jobs bill.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:52.010
It's called The Invent and
Manufacturer in America.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.479
And I think that most of
us around the table: we're

00:21:54.479 --> 00:21:56.982
so tired of coming up with
innovation, and we come up

00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:59.184
with these wonderful
conceptions, but we drive

00:21:59.184 --> 00:22:02.020
these folks off shore, and
then we blame them for leaving.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.389
They say, "I would have
stayed if you had let me

00:22:04.389 --> 00:22:07.459
stay home," but this piece
right here, Mr. President,

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:09.027
I'm going to pass
it down to you.

00:22:09.027 --> 00:22:10.429
This is a piece that's
going to bring all those

00:22:10.429 --> 00:22:13.365
jobs back home, and we'll
use carrots instead of sticks.

00:22:13.365 --> 00:22:14.800
We're going to make
America great again every

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.902
single day, but I've
got to tell you.

00:22:16.902 --> 00:22:19.171
Since the morning of
November 9, getting

00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:20.739
through November 8, was
great, but the morning of

00:22:20.739 --> 00:22:23.141
November 9: the skies have
never been bluer, the

00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:24.810
winds have never been
stronger at our back, and

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:25.977
it's all thanks to you.

00:22:25.977 --> 00:22:26.945
The President:Thank you Mike.

00:22:26.945 --> 00:22:28.046
I appreciate it.

00:22:28.046 --> 00:22:28.714
Thank you.

00:22:28.714 --> 00:22:30.348
Thanks Mike.

00:22:30.348 --> 00:22:31.550
(applause)

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:34.820
John DeArment: Good
afternoon everybody.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.489
Mr. President, Mr. Vice
President, thank you very

00:22:37.489 --> 00:22:40.158
much for the privilege
and honor to be here.

00:22:40.158 --> 00:22:41.326
My name is John DeArment.

00:22:41.326 --> 00:22:44.029
I'm president and chief
operating officer of

00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.696
Channel Lock, Inc.

00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:47.365
You got it.

00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:49.868
We make our genuine
channel lock pliers back

00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:51.403
in Meadville,
Pennsylvania.

00:22:51.403 --> 00:22:54.473
We have about 325
full-time associates that

00:22:54.473 --> 00:22:57.309
really work hard every day
making the products, and

00:22:57.309 --> 00:22:59.578
we think that tools like
this will help you make

00:22:59.578 --> 00:23:00.879
America make great again.

00:23:00.879 --> 00:23:02.914
The President:
That's a great product.

00:23:02.914 --> 00:23:03.982
That's a beautiful
product.

00:23:03.982 --> 00:23:05.317
Believe it or not, I
used to do this a lot.

00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:05.984
I love it.

00:23:05.984 --> 00:23:08.553
I love mechanical things,
but this is really, really

00:23:08.553 --> 00:23:09.755
beautiful: high-quality.

00:23:09.755 --> 00:23:11.089
John DeArment:
Thank you very much.

00:23:11.089 --> 00:23:12.791
The President: It
doesn't get any better.

00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:13.625
Thank you.

00:23:13.625 --> 00:23:16.094
John DeArment: There are
a lot of people that work

00:23:16.094 --> 00:23:17.062
very hard doing it.

00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:17.796
I appreciate it.

00:23:17.796 --> 00:23:18.463
(applause)

00:23:18.463 --> 00:23:19.131
The President:Thank you.

00:23:19.131 --> 00:23:20.465
So folks, I know you're
going to stay around for a

00:23:20.465 --> 00:23:22.400
little while with my
people, but I appreciate

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.003
you being here, and we're
supportive of you totally

00:23:25.003 --> 00:23:26.638
and Made in
America is great.

00:23:26.638 --> 00:23:27.539
Made in the U.S.A.

00:23:27.539 --> 00:23:31.643
is great, and we're
behind you all the way.

00:23:31.643 --> 00:23:32.778
We're behind
you all the way.

00:23:32.778 --> 00:23:34.579
Am I allowed to put
this in the museum?

00:23:34.579 --> 00:23:35.947
It's got my name on it.

00:23:35.947 --> 00:23:39.417
I figure you can't -- who
else is going to want it, right?

00:23:39.417 --> 00:23:40.085
(laughter)

00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:41.186
But that is
really something.

00:23:41.186 --> 00:23:44.489
I mean, the product we
make in this country:

00:23:44.489 --> 00:23:45.957
people don't get it.

00:23:45.957 --> 00:23:47.592
It's great, but now we're
going to put you on that

00:23:47.592 --> 00:23:50.061
level playing field, and
that's what you need and

00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:50.996
nobody's going
to beat you.

00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:52.998
Once you have the level
playing field, nobody is

00:23:52.998 --> 00:23:53.665
going to beat you.

00:23:53.665 --> 00:23:54.366
Thank you very much.

00:23:54.366 --> 00:23:59.371
(applause)
