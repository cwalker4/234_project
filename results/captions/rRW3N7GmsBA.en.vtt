00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980
Japanese were not really known for their tank prowess.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.660
No. I think that's fair.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.180
(Laughs) I mean some of them, a good Vickers will go through them, the inside and the outside.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.820
But, as we were saying another time,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.480
if you've got the only tank that actually shows up, well this thing is small enough that it'll go through the jungles not bad.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.800
You have a problem when you start going up against Matildas, or Grants, or Shermans.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.220
Yes, this little pop-gun is not going to do much harm to the front of the Matilda.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.020
And the armor's certainly not going to do it. But here's a kind of weird little feature.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.620
So, the turret is a loose, rotating turret.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.600
(ah, come on!) There we go.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.480
Oh right, yes.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:43.240
And, ah! That's what happened. But, inside you can move the gun independently to the turret.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.320
So a fine adjustment, and perhaps for being a little bit more stealthy...

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.980
...you're slightly more likely to draw attention to yourself if you rotate the whole turret perhaps?

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.915
I have no idea. I really don't know why they did this.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.300
I can't think of another tank that does that.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.260
Um, there are some of the Czech tanks, the 38t, if I recall, could do a little bit of independent traverse.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.040
Okay.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.640
And you could do it with a coax on some French tanks if I recall, which is a bit odd.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.640
So, partly I would imagine, I would have thought that all the tanks that have that feature probably have a small gun.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.320
Yes.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.500
Because it's another thing that you've got to engineer to be strong enough to withstand the recoil and the weight of the gun.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.200
Well in fairness, this is a mighty recoil on this gun here (sarcastically).

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.040
Right.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.960
Well, no.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.680
So but, ah, the, the, he's using what sometimes people call "body english" (laughs)

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:39.180
He's in that. . . He's in that. . . He's in that turret on his own, one man and he's got to aim the whole gun pretty much just using his body weight.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.440
And hopefully your turret is well balanced, but I don't think this is a balanced turret

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.540
because you've got the frontal armor, but there's no bustle balancing it out on the back end, so this is nose heavy.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.640
Which is fine if you're on flat ground.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.760
Right.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.480
Now tilt over to one side a little bit. What's the turret going to do?

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.060
Ah, something very convenient, sort of that.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.860
Yes, and then, you've got to use your upper body strength to try to lug this thing around.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:09.020
Right, but if you were using your body strength to..to aim the gun left and right, you might not want to have to move the entire turret,

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.280
so moving just the gun and a little bit of mantlet might make it less tiring and more precise. (questioning gesture)

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.580
I'm not going to say you're wrong.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.760
I. .I'm.. Tell you what, let's just say that I don't know why they did it, and we'll leave it at that.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.400
Okay. And I don't either, but I've come up with a conjecture!

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.480
Hey, prove him wrong!

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.600
Don't (facetiously).

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.540
Ha ha!

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:39.200
Now, I do of course, have viewers in Australia, and I don't want them to feel left out, so don't, because this is a tank produced by Australia!

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.580
It's the Sentinel!

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.760
The pride of the Australian army(sarcastically), and it's actually an engineering feat.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.580
Oh, yes?

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.600
Strategically, it was a very bad idea because Australia was not a large country at the time, and didn't have manpower to devote. .

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.100
(mm hm)

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.060
to building tanks when you had other countries that theoretically could build tanks for you, like the Americans.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.280
But, in terms of what they achieved, this is fantastic!

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.340
I mean, this is the first tank to have a fully cast hull.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.400
Is it?

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.100
It is.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.620
You mean in one go?

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.140
Correct.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.240
It's not top. . . ah!, 'cause the French stuff like the Somua 35's (all bolted). . . it's two pieces bolted together.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.740
Four

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.220
two MAIN pieces bolted together.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.440
Okay, so umm

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.260
Well, three.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.100
This is. .(mutual laughter) . .

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.600
but this is all in one go?

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.260
It is.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.600
That is impressive

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.340
because one of the reasons that you might not expect the Australians to produce a tank is that

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.060
they didn't have the massive steel industries, the massive shipyards, and all the rest of it, so...

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.500
for them to have achieved that particular feat is doubly impressive!

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.140
Right! And if you look in the. . the records of it, they got the engineering and the metalworking companies are going

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.960
"Well no one's ever done this before, but we don't see any technical reason why we can't, so let's give it a go."

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.900
And it did.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.400
Their big problem was the engines.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.980
Because the Australians didn't have any heavy motive industries, so they didn't have any engines that were powerful enough to move a twenty ton tank,

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.520
Right.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.080
or the transmission systems to do it.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.120
uh huh

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.360
So, if you can't make your own engines, what do you do?

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.120
You go shopping.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.900
Well, what's available? Cadillac V-8's from cars.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.220
(okay)

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.420
Not very powerful, so they put three of them in the back of this.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.180
Well, that ought to do it!

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.080
Yep, you just had to get all three working together.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.980
And then you put a two-pounder on it and one of the most God-awful turrets I've ever been in in my life!

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:16.480
(Oh!)

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.660
Unfortunately, yes. Ergonomically, this thing is quite possibly the worst turret I've ever been in.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.920
Okay,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.060
so that probably didn't get copied by others then.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.380
No, not so much.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.280
But is there some legacy then? Is there something from this that the world of tank design did take away,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.200
saying: "That's a good idea! We'll do that forevermore!"

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.660
Um. . they know what not to do.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.980
Could this design... (talking simultaneously)

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.920
of mantlet for instance for the front of the machine gun. . (for the Vickers)

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.400
so yeah, (it's. . it's) this. .this. . look at that, how beautifully balanced that is, you see. It goes left, it goes right, it goes up and down.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.920
You could. . you could.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.160
It certainly is an attention-getter.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.020
Right!

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.900
I mean, just think of the amount of heat that could be taken away from the gun with that mass of metal there.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.260
So yeah, I mean it was a water-cooled machine though, that was why it was so big.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.000
Right.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.420
And of course you got the coax up there. Now eventually, they came up with the bigger concept, the AC4. They were going to put a seventeen-pounder in this thing.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.040
Ha! Good luck!

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.880
And they said that they made it. . they designed a version with a seventy-inch turret ring, which would be the same size as the Centurion.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:19.980
I do not know how you get a Centurion sized turret ring onto this thing. I remain to be convinced that was such a good idea.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.120
Yes, it's clearly wider than the actual thing, so they were lying.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.660
Yeah.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.360
But anyway, so they built about 60 of them.  They never saw service.  They decided, "You know, the Americans are going to give us lots of Shermans (yeah), lets use Shermans."

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.460
But, well done Australia, even so! Fully cast hull!

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.360
Oh wow, look! It's a Valiant! Another great British tank!

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.180
With a name that begins with "V", like. . like. . like. . like valentine, and "V" for victory!

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.740
Tell us about the Valiant!

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:56.800
Well it was a valiant effort perhaps. This was arguably the worst tank ever built. I do have a copy of the test report. Remind me, I'll send it to you.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.820
And this tank was so bad that the officer in charge called it quits after thirteen miles.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:09.500
After that, it's sole purpose was that they would leave it in the workshops and then drag it out every now and then

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:16.040
and they would give the officers in training a notepad and say, "Find as many faults as possible as you can on this tank."

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.280
So it did have a use then?!

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.420
It did have a use, granted, but yeah, no.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.400
I mean it had some interesting design features, like this piked nose you see on the IS3 later.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.400
Oh, yes.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.380
So this was a highly influential design then.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:35.640
Very much so. Now, part of the problem was that, ah, the back of the hatch here was so located as to grab you in the back of the neck.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.140
Right.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.420
If your foot accidentally slipped off the clutch, you'd be stuck there. You'd have to chop off your foot to get it out.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.140
Ah.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.560
Getting it into reverse, not so easy. Ah. .

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.120
Right.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.340
you might lose your hand. The gun on the turret actually seemed to work relatively okay.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.040
But, it was in no danger of ever ending up in the right place to be fired at the enemy?

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.960
No, no. Ah. . the engine and suspension were questionable.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:08.720
Ah. . I mean, if it only ran thirt. . if it only ran thirteen miles and they're already talking about the questionable powertrain, that probably tells you something.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.460
Ah. . yes. I think if . . if a tank gets thirteen miles, think "Right, lets abandon that.",

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.200
they've sort of. . it's almost as though they're looking for an excuse, don't you think?

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.880
Yeah, it's called "We're miserable, lets go home!"

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.600
Ah, right. How do you pretend. . how do you pretend. . do you turn around and wait for someone to come with a loader?

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.640
Actually, I don't . . I don't think the tests expressed how it got back.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.760
So I think maybe the thirteen miles was after the out and back and they just decided to stop it there.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.260
Oh, okay.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.680
But, ah, I mean, it's not as if the British were afraid to try interesting and unusual things.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.660
No, and to point. . they weren't actually doing this during the war.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.160
Yes.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.720
There was a war on, and they had a go at producing this. So, you know, fair play to them for that, surely.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:55.720
Yeah, I mean this is one of the assault tanks going up against the Excelsior or T14 in that role (uh huh), which are substantially bigger, heavier tanks. So it might have been a bit optimistic.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:02.740
Wh. . wha. . why did they see a need for this tank? What... what role did it have that wasn't filled by other tanks?

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:11.060
Effectivly it's the role that was filled by Churchill in the end of it. I mean, it wasn't really an infantry tank as much as. . there was a very subtle difference between an infantry tank and an assault tank.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:11.600
Right.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.940
And this was going to be an assault tank. But the general concept is heavily armored mobile firepower.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:24.380
Okay, so, ah. . not so good on the armor, or mobility. But, hey, It had a mediocre gun!

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:31.080
So, you know, that's something, right?! (breathy chuckle) And it was good for training. The Valiant!

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.420
Lindybeige!
