00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:19.673
How many of you are dog people?

00:00:19.674 --> 00:00:21.593
A show of hands.

00:00:21.594 --> 00:00:22.825
Excellent!

00:00:22.826 --> 00:00:24.863
How about cat people?

00:00:24.864 --> 00:00:27.251
OK, you guys can go to the break early.

00:00:27.251 --> 00:00:28.922
(Laughter)

00:00:30.144 --> 00:00:32.328
So, of the dog people

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.559
and the cat people
who want to be dog people,

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.559
(Laughter)

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.158
how many of you have thought,

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:40.561
"Wouldn't it be great to know
what my dog is thinking?"

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:45.541
I think everyone else already knows
what their dog is thinking, right?

00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:49.924
I got into this project,

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:53.282
and I'm going to tell you
a little bit about how -

00:00:54.258 --> 00:00:57.714
This is basically
a stupid dog trick story.

00:00:57.715 --> 00:01:01.325
It really started
with this dog named Newton,

00:01:01.326 --> 00:01:03.865
who was really my favorite dog.

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:07.642
I've had many dogs through my life,
but Newton was my favorite,

00:01:07.643 --> 00:01:10.919
and he lived to be about 15 years old.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.004
After he passed away, I thought,

00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:18.426
I have these tools, this MRI machine,
that I have been using for decades

00:01:18.426 --> 00:01:22.524
to study human decision making
and what motivates people,

00:01:22.524 --> 00:01:25.002
why haven't we used this on other animals?

00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:26.705
Certainly, other animals

00:01:26.705 --> 00:01:30.622
have many of the same feelings
and motivations that people do.

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:34.513
But this is kind of an area of science
that people don't like to talk about.

00:01:35.563 --> 00:01:38.918
So I embarked on this project
about four years ago

00:01:38.918 --> 00:01:43.922
to try to figure out what dogs think,
and specifically what dogs think of us.

00:01:46.112 --> 00:01:47.851
If we're talking about humans,

00:01:47.852 --> 00:01:49.477
we have kind of two ways

00:01:49.477 --> 00:01:51.957
we can think about what
other people are thinking:

00:01:51.957 --> 00:01:55.344
we can either ask them,
and sometimes they will tell us

00:01:55.344 --> 00:01:59.797
if they know, and they want us
to know what they are thinking;

00:01:59.798 --> 00:02:02.768
or we can observe actions,
we can observe behaviors,

00:02:02.768 --> 00:02:07.403
we can try to infer things about what
people are thinking from their actions.

00:02:09.053 --> 00:02:12.980
With animals, and dogs, of course,
we can't really ask them.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.403
We can ask them,
and we may think that they tell us,

00:02:15.403 --> 00:02:17.602
but we really don't know
what they're thinking.

00:02:17.602 --> 00:02:19.993
So we're kind of left
with their behaviors:

00:02:19.993 --> 00:02:21.473
we can observe their actions,

00:02:21.473 --> 00:02:24.189
and we can try to infer
what they are thinking.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.177
This is the foundation of behaviorism,
and it's been around since Pavlov.

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:33.616
But there are, of course,
very tricky issues here,

00:02:33.616 --> 00:02:37.802
and humans being humans,
we tend to anthropomorphize everything.

00:02:38.723 --> 00:02:40.027
It's kind of in this area

00:02:40.027 --> 00:02:43.139
that I became very interested 
in intrigued with the possibility

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:48.209
of trying to figure out what dogs
are thinking by using MRI.

00:02:49.978 --> 00:02:53.294
The technique is straightforward.
It's been around for decades.

00:02:53.295 --> 00:02:56.405
The idea is: if we were studying a human,

00:02:56.405 --> 00:03:00.382
we would put a human in an MRI,
have them do some type of task,

00:03:00.382 --> 00:03:03.065
and we'd measure blood flow
or brain activity

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:06.315
and then try to figure out
what parts of the brain do what.

00:03:06.316 --> 00:03:08.709
Very straightforward,
if you've had an MRI,

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.847
it's not terribly pleasant,
but people will do it.

00:03:12.888 --> 00:03:16.787
How do we do this with other animals?
How do we do it with a dog?

00:03:18.138 --> 00:03:20.970
I'm going to show you what we found.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.400
Here's a short video.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.011
It's a what we call our training video,
and it demonstrates how we did this.

00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:28.181
Before I start it,

00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:30.391
you're going to see
two dogs in this video.

00:03:30.391 --> 00:03:32.950
The first dog, Callie, is my dog.

00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:36.408
She was actually
the replacement for Newton.

00:03:36.408 --> 00:03:39.427
She was adopted here in Atlanta
from the Humane Society.

00:03:39.428 --> 00:03:42.587
We loved Newton so much;
we could never get another pug,

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:45.061
so Callie is the anti-pug.

00:03:46.191 --> 00:03:49.231
The other dog is McKenzie,
a border collie.

00:03:50.238 --> 00:03:51.958
We just kind of get right into it.

00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.117
I'll narrate as we go along.

00:03:54.117 --> 00:03:56.647
[Callie - Introduction to head coil]

00:03:56.647 --> 00:03:58.047
This's Mark Spivak.

00:03:58.048 --> 00:04:01.586
He's my partner in this endeavor,
he's a dog trainer.

00:04:01.587 --> 00:04:03.509
The first thing that we had to do

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:07.300
is figure out how do we get dogs
to go into a tube,

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.459
to put a head coil around their head
to pick up the brain waves,

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.189
and hold absolutely still.

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.779
What you are seeing here, is that
Callie is not a particularly obedient dog;

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:21.358
she has no particularly special skills.

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:28.280
But she does have one very good trait,
and that is: she likes hot dogs.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.592
Mark is doing what we call
clicker training.

00:04:32.598 --> 00:04:35.117
Every time she approximates
what we want her to do,

00:04:35.117 --> 00:04:38.057
he clicks, and then she gets a hot dog.

00:04:39.218 --> 00:04:41.243
This's the very first time

00:04:41.244 --> 00:04:44.123
she's been introduced
to the thing we call the head coil,

00:04:44.124 --> 00:04:45.908
and we didn't know at this point

00:04:45.908 --> 00:04:47.958
whether this was even
going to be possible.

00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.788
[McKenzie - Introduction to head coil]

00:04:49.788 --> 00:04:53.175
This dog, McKenzie,
a border collie, is highly trained.

00:04:53.175 --> 00:04:55.333
She's very skilled in agility,

00:04:55.333 --> 00:05:00.783
and her owner, as you'll see,
gets her to sit in this coil very quickly.

00:05:02.464 --> 00:05:04.561
(Video) Dog owner: Good girl!

00:05:05.481 --> 00:05:07.001
Yes!

00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:09.059
Is she too far out now?

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:10.952
(Video) Gregory Berns: Yeah, basically,

00:05:10.952 --> 00:05:17.669
we are looking for the brain case
to be in the center, right there.

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.389
That's good.

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:21.567
(On stage) GB: If you've had an MRI,

00:05:22.687 --> 00:05:26.027
you know that you're told
not to move, right?

00:05:26.027 --> 00:05:28.468
This is the big challenge of doing this.

00:05:28.468 --> 00:05:30.858
[Mckenzie - Holding without any chin rest]

00:05:30.858 --> 00:05:31.887
Up until this point,

00:05:31.887 --> 00:05:34.998
I didn't know if this was going
to be possible until I saw this.

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:38.562
This was literally
after about five minutes of training.

00:05:46.302 --> 00:05:48.561
When I saw that, I knew we could do this.

00:05:54.358 --> 00:05:57.924
[Callie - Training with chin rest]

00:05:57.924 --> 00:06:01.895
What you saw McKenzie doing was close
but not quite good enough.

00:06:01.896 --> 00:06:03.806
What we are going after

00:06:03.806 --> 00:06:08.226
if we're to achieve data
that compares to humans -

00:06:08.226 --> 00:06:12.796
(Video) GB: You are perfect! 
Excellent! Perfect job!

00:06:12.796 --> 00:06:15.600
(On stage) GB: Mark told me
I had to be more demonstrative

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.820
than I am normally.

00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:20.171
(Laughter)

00:06:20.172 --> 00:06:22.069
(Video) GB: Perfect! Yes!

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.300
(Laughter)

00:06:26.572 --> 00:06:30.097
(On stage) GB: What you notice we did
was we introduced a little chin rest

00:06:30.097 --> 00:06:33.625
because we have to give the dogs
a target to put their head on.

00:06:33.626 --> 00:06:36.688
McKenzie adapts this very quickly.

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:41.419
She's actually in a simulator
for an MRI that we built.

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:43.388
She's doing quite well,

00:06:43.388 --> 00:06:46.107
but this is actually
still too much movement.

00:06:46.997 --> 00:06:51.560
The really difficult part of this
is the noise that the scanner makes,

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.111
playing in the background.

00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:56.805
These are recordings that we made
to acclimate the dogs to the training.

00:06:58.246 --> 00:06:59.739
It's very loud.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.347
This's being played at low volume
just to get her used to it.

00:07:03.347 --> 00:07:05.416
But it's really about 95 decibels,

00:07:05.417 --> 00:07:07.347
and it's like jackhammer loud.

00:07:07.347 --> 00:07:09.565
(Video) GB: That's it,
that what we are doing!

00:07:09.565 --> 00:07:12.518

about a month or two of training.

[Callie - Scammer training]

00:07:14.458 --> 00:07:16.554
We're at the real MRI now.

00:07:18.184 --> 00:07:22.763
This's probably the most expensive
training session ever performed.

00:07:22.764 --> 00:07:25.508
(Laughter)

an hour to use the MRI.

00:07:31.536 --> 00:07:34.466
(Laughter)

00:07:37.138 --> 00:07:39.711
But we had to use the real thing
at a certain point.

00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:43.518
At this point, we didn't even know how
they would react to the magnetic field.

00:07:45.988 --> 00:07:48.847
The key thing I want you to notice

00:07:48.848 --> 00:07:53.859
is these dogs are doing it willingly,
and they enjoy it.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.279
That is the whole point of this project.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:00.875
We treat these animals
as family members.

00:08:00.875 --> 00:08:03.315
We don't sedate them,
and we don't restrain them.

to the chin rest,

If you look carefully, you also notice
that she's wearing ear muffs.

00:08:21.696 --> 00:08:23.047
It's very important

00:08:23.047 --> 00:08:26.556
because the scanner is so loud,
and the dogs hearing is quite sensitive.

The "hot dog, no hot dog" hand signals,

00:08:49.587 --> 00:08:51.126
we started with this

00:08:51.126 --> 00:08:53.437
because we didn't know
if this was going to work,

00:08:53.437 --> 00:08:56.244
so we decided we needed
to do something really simple.

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:59.505
This's just straight up
Pavlovian conditioning

00:08:59.506 --> 00:09:01.600
where we taught the dogs
two hand signals:

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.188
this means "hot dog,"
and this means "no hot dog."

00:09:05.339 --> 00:09:07.283
If this technique works,

00:09:07.283 --> 00:09:11.833
what we should see is activity
in the reward system of their brain

00:09:11.833 --> 00:09:14.768
to this hand signal but not this signal.

00:09:15.719 --> 00:09:19.904
I also put up a slide here.

00:09:19.904 --> 00:09:21.677
Once we started doing this,

00:09:21.677 --> 00:09:24.491
the word got out amongst
the community here in Atlanta

00:09:24.491 --> 00:09:27.732
that we're doing this crazy
dog scanning project.

00:09:27.732 --> 00:09:29.163
We're looking for volunteers,

00:09:29.163 --> 00:09:33.930
especially people who like to train dogs
and have dogs that are very well behaved.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.365
That's still true.

00:09:35.365 --> 00:09:39.270
If you have a dog that can do this
or you think can do this, talk to me.

00:09:39.271 --> 00:09:43.234
Because the project is still going on,
and it's gotten quite large.

00:09:45.012 --> 00:09:47.399
You've seen the kind of preliminary video.

00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:51.120
This's one of my favorite photos
because it's kind of captures -

00:09:51.124 --> 00:09:54.063
this is the first day
we were actually doing the scanning.

00:09:54.064 --> 00:09:56.296
It captures the human confusion here.

00:09:56.296 --> 00:10:01.156
We were just standing around trying
to figure out how we are going to do this.

00:10:01.157 --> 00:10:04.794
But Callie knows, she's been trained,
she's been doing this for two months;

00:10:04.794 --> 00:10:06.522
so she's ready to go.

00:10:07.864 --> 00:10:11.764
The head wrap is just
to keep the ear muffs in place.

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:15.120
This is what it look likes
from the other end,

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.887
from the business end of the scanner.

00:10:16.888 --> 00:10:21.236
This's actually a dog named Zen.
He's a yellow lab golden retriever.

00:10:24.796 --> 00:10:30.191
What we're studying initially
is just the reward system response.

00:10:30.192 --> 00:10:32.563
Very simply, we got
these two hand signals,

00:10:32.564 --> 00:10:36.498
and the idea is we compare
the brain response to these two things.

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.797
As I said, we have many dogs
doing this now,

00:10:41.798 --> 00:10:43.542
it's not just shelter dogs.

00:10:43.543 --> 00:10:46.773
We have dogs from
service dog organizations,

00:10:46.773 --> 00:10:50.507
we have shelter dogs -
really all sorts of breeds.

00:10:52.218 --> 00:10:54.030
Before I show you some of the results,

00:10:54.031 --> 00:10:56.918
I do want to say something
about brain anatomy.

00:10:58.028 --> 00:11:01.977
A dog brain - this slide is not to scale.

00:11:01.977 --> 00:11:08.398
A dog brain is probably about the size
of a plum or a lemon maybe,

00:11:08.398 --> 00:11:10.398
depending on the size of the dog.

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:13.836
It's not big, even if you have a big dog,

00:11:13.837 --> 00:11:17.947
most of the head is muscle,
so just going to be aware of that.

00:11:17.948 --> 00:11:19.752
But I like putting up this slide

00:11:19.753 --> 00:11:24.046
because it shows
the similarities of animal brains.

00:11:24.046 --> 00:11:27.094
You can immediately
make out common structures.

00:11:27.095 --> 00:11:30.962
You can see towards the right
that kind of pretty structure

00:11:30.966 --> 00:11:34.736
is the cerebellum that controls
various types of motor movement,

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:37.778
and then below that,
there is the brainstem.

00:11:37.778 --> 00:11:40.252
The really the parts of the brain
that are different

00:11:40.252 --> 00:11:42.162
are what we call the cortex.

00:11:42.162 --> 00:11:45.386
That's the upper part, the folded part.

00:11:45.387 --> 00:11:50.159
The big differences between dog and human
have to do with the size of the cortex

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.198
and how folded it is.

00:11:52.199 --> 00:11:54.233
What folding accomplishes

00:11:54.233 --> 00:11:58.881
is packing a lot more brain surface area
into a specific volume.

00:11:58.882 --> 00:12:00.121
Generally speaking,

00:12:00.122 --> 00:12:02.983
the more folded a brain,
the more surface area,

00:12:02.984 --> 00:12:05.214
the more brain power, if you will.

00:12:06.456 --> 00:12:09.864
There are lot of similarities,
and there are some differences.

00:12:09.865 --> 00:12:12.975
What I am particularly interested in
are the similarities.

00:12:12.975 --> 00:12:17.305
Because if we were to have a commonality
of experience with dogs,

00:12:17.306 --> 00:12:19.485
and other animals for that matter,

00:12:19.486 --> 00:12:22.823
we have to share the same
or similar brain structures.

00:12:22.824 --> 00:12:25.524
Darwin said this 150 years ago.

00:12:27.276 --> 00:12:29.705
What do the results look like?

00:12:29.705 --> 00:12:33.641
This's a very compact way
of summarizing an experiment

00:12:33.642 --> 00:12:37.686
which I showed you where the dogs
receive two different hand signals,

00:12:37.687 --> 00:12:41.210
and we've averaged the results over,
in this case, 12 dogs,

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:44.768
I think though, we've done this
probably in over 20 dogs.

00:12:45.699 --> 00:12:47.384
The orange areas show

00:12:47.384 --> 00:12:51.807
what parts of the brain are more active
to this reward signal,

00:12:51.807 --> 00:12:53.507
this hot dog signal.

00:12:54.807 --> 00:12:56.277
What I want to emphasize

00:12:56.277 --> 00:13:00.645
is the brain response
is not directly to hot dogs,

00:13:00.645 --> 00:13:03.515
it's to the hand signal
that means hot dogs.

00:13:04.715 --> 00:13:07.603
You may think that's not a big deal;
it's still hot dogs.

00:13:07.603 --> 00:13:10.589
It's no surprise that dogs like hot dogs.

00:13:10.589 --> 00:13:13.259
But it is a big deal
because we train this signal;

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:19.115
it's a symbolic representation
of a hot dog that the dog has learned

00:13:19.115 --> 00:13:21.311
and has learned
to recognize this meaning.

00:13:22.691 --> 00:13:24.476
The particular parts of the brain

00:13:24.476 --> 00:13:27.256
that are being active
are the reward system.

00:13:27.256 --> 00:13:29.010
There's kind of two hot spots.

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:31.550
There's a headlight type picture.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:34.452
That's in an area of the brain
called the cortex nucleus.

00:13:34.452 --> 00:13:37.702
It's the area of the brain
that all mammals have,

00:13:37.702 --> 00:13:41.002
and it's the area that has the most
dopamine receptors in the brain.

00:13:41.002 --> 00:13:46.174
It's kind of the key center that links
reward and motivation with action.

00:13:46.174 --> 00:13:49.990
Normally, when that's active
in a human or any other animal,

00:13:49.991 --> 00:13:52.245
it means that something
important has happened,

00:13:52.246 --> 00:13:54.811
and the animal needs to do something.

00:13:54.812 --> 00:13:58.489
In this case it's quite simple
because they will just eat the hot dogs.

00:14:00.484 --> 00:14:02.743
Well, so what?

00:14:02.744 --> 00:14:06.295
So we proved that dog brains
like hot dogs.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.616
That was just the beginning.

00:14:10.487 --> 00:14:13.245
This started about four years ago,

00:14:13.246 --> 00:14:17.439
and we've since gone on
and done many other experiments.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:22.534
Most of the dogs in these pictures,
are still working with us in the project.

00:14:22.535 --> 00:14:24.619
We've done things looking at

00:14:24.619 --> 00:14:30.198
how their olfaction, 
or their sensory system for smell works,

00:14:30.198 --> 00:14:32.788
how they identify different people,

00:14:32.788 --> 00:14:35.885
and other dogs
in their household by smell.

00:14:35.885 --> 00:14:39.542
One of the things that we found
is that this reward system,

00:14:39.543 --> 00:14:44.611
the same part of the brain activates
when the dogs smell a familiar human,

00:14:44.612 --> 00:14:46.997
even if the human is not there.

00:14:47.808 --> 00:14:51.027
It shows that dogs
have representations of us

00:14:51.028 --> 00:14:54.588
of our identities that persist
when we are not there.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.838
When people ask me,
"Do dogs miss us when we are gone?"

00:14:59.839 --> 00:15:04.838
I have to say yes because we find evidence
that they are remembering their humans,

00:15:04.839 --> 00:15:06.467
that they care about them,

00:15:06.468 --> 00:15:09.008
and that it's associated
with these reward responses.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.898
Is it still just hot dogs?

00:15:13.838 --> 00:15:16.703
To answer this question,
one of the other things that we did

00:15:16.703 --> 00:15:19.243
was we actually repeated
the experiment I showed you,

00:15:19.243 --> 00:15:21.762
where we show
the different hand signals.

00:15:21.763 --> 00:15:26.586
With one little twist:
we manipulate who gives the signals.

00:15:26.586 --> 00:15:29.604
Does it matter if the dog's
owner gives a signal?

00:15:29.605 --> 00:15:32.341
Or whether a stranger comes in
and gives the signal?

00:15:32.342 --> 00:15:35.336
Or even whether a computer
gives the signal?

00:15:35.337 --> 00:15:39.657
Because if you believe Pavlov,
and all the behaviorist who followed him,

00:15:39.658 --> 00:15:41.130
it really shouldn't matter,

00:15:41.131 --> 00:15:46.931
because any signal that indicates
an upcoming food treat is all the same,

00:15:46.931 --> 00:15:50.569
if animals and dogs
are just kind of robots.

00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:53.493
But in fact, we did find a difference.

00:15:53.493 --> 00:15:57.842
What's very interesting about it
is that not all dogs are the same.

00:15:57.842 --> 00:16:01.164
For example, my dog Callie
had a much greater response

00:16:01.165 --> 00:16:02.618
in that part of the brain

00:16:02.619 --> 00:16:05.947
when a stranger gave the signals
or even a computer

00:16:05.948 --> 00:16:07.289
as opposed to me!

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:09.540
(Laughter)

00:16:11.162 --> 00:16:12.519
Other dogs in the project,

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.970
some of the golden retrievers in the labs
can have had the opposite pattern,

00:16:16.971 --> 00:16:21.261
where their owners had really elicited
the strongest brain response.

00:16:22.501 --> 00:16:24.192
This is very interesting

00:16:24.193 --> 00:16:26.325
because what it does is it provides us

00:16:26.325 --> 00:16:31.258
with a neural biomarker
of the dog's personality profile.

00:16:31.259 --> 00:16:34.278
In fact, what we've done
is we've spun off a new project

00:16:34.279 --> 00:16:36.686
which we're very excited about.

00:16:36.687 --> 00:16:37.687
We've partnered

00:16:37.687 --> 00:16:40.342
with Canine Companions for Independence,

00:16:40.342 --> 00:16:45.832
which is the largest service dog training
organization in the United States.

00:16:45.832 --> 00:16:50.588
If you know anything about service dogs,
they're incredibly difficult to train.

00:16:50.588 --> 00:16:55.061
It's very expensive,
and there's a very low success rate.

00:16:55.062 --> 00:16:58.621
Roughly about 35% of dogs
that enter these programs

00:16:58.622 --> 00:17:02.012
to train to be assistance dogs
will succeed;

00:17:02.013 --> 00:17:06.813
the other 2/3 end up being released
and adopted to their puppy raisers.

00:17:06.813 --> 00:17:09.224
So we've partnered with CCI,

00:17:09.226 --> 00:17:13.629
and they're actually training their dogs
to do the MRI procedure.

00:17:13.629 --> 00:17:16.069
What we're going to do
is try to predict

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:19.250
which of those dogs
will actually be good service dogs.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.657
I really love this project

00:17:22.659 --> 00:17:25.515
because it shows 
that even though we started this

00:17:25.515 --> 00:17:29.145
just as my silly example
of trying to understand

00:17:29.145 --> 00:17:31.597
what my dogs think,
and whether they love me,

00:17:31.597 --> 00:17:33.497
it's actually gotten much bigger.

00:17:34.237 --> 00:17:36.577
Dogs are special.

00:17:36.582 --> 00:17:39.621
They're the first domesticated animals.

00:17:39.622 --> 00:17:42.782
They have been with humans
since humans have been humans.

00:17:44.443 --> 00:17:45.853
When we look at their brains,

00:17:45.853 --> 00:17:47.944
it's almost like we
are looking back in time,

00:17:47.944 --> 00:17:52.553
and it's giving us a picture
of how the dog-human bond formed.

00:17:52.553 --> 00:17:53.493
Thank you.

00:17:53.494 --> 00:17:56.254
(Applause)
