00:00:11.797 --> 00:00:14.637
This is a picture
of my grandfather and myself

00:00:15.168 --> 00:00:17.998
in the mid-1950s walking around Sydney.

00:00:18.778 --> 00:00:21.548
A few years later, in about 1959,

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.940
my grandfather died
very comfortably at home

00:00:25.146 --> 00:00:27.856
under the care
of his general practitioner.

00:00:28.955 --> 00:00:31.555
This is a talk about death and dying,

00:00:32.195 --> 00:00:34.804
and it's too late to leave,
and the doors are locked.

00:00:34.804 --> 00:00:36.471
(Laughter)

00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:39.971
But it's about death and dying
only in the very elderly,

00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:42.925
naturally and normally coming
to the end of their life.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.390
So, why was it that my grandfather

00:00:46.394 --> 00:00:48.724
was allowed to die at home
quite comfortably,

00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:53.358
but my mother, 25 years later,
it was a very different story,

00:00:53.358 --> 00:00:54.678
which I'll come to.

00:00:55.904 --> 00:01:00.204
One of the reasons was that at that time
in the general practitioner's bag,

00:01:00.915 --> 00:01:05.555
there wasn't much more or less
than what you found in hospitals.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.560
This isn't all that long ago.

00:01:08.394 --> 00:01:12.694
So hospitals were where you went
if you were sort of sick,

00:01:13.303 --> 00:01:15.253
but if you were poor as well,

00:01:15.572 --> 00:01:18.772
and you sat in your bed
being very carefully nursed,

00:01:18.872 --> 00:01:22.482
and sometimes you got better,
and sometimes you didn't.

00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:25.803
You can see this in films at the time,

00:01:25.988 --> 00:01:30.271
where if anyone gets injured
in the street, someone shot or stabbed,

00:01:30.532 --> 00:01:33.952
then there's a bystander
shouts, "Quickly call a doctor!"

00:01:34.941 --> 00:01:37.721
A few years later, the bystander says,

00:01:37.721 --> 00:01:40.031
"Quickly call an ambulance!"

00:01:40.352 --> 00:01:43.182
So what was it in hospitals
that was changing?

00:01:43.444 --> 00:01:48.094
It was about the early 1960s,
and there was an explosion of technology,

00:01:48.552 --> 00:01:52.492
marvelous ways that we could image
every single part of the body,

00:01:52.961 --> 00:01:54.211
complex surgery,

00:01:54.574 --> 00:01:57.593
we divided the body into "-ologies" -

00:01:57.593 --> 00:02:02.213
neurology, cardiology,
gastroenterology, etc. -

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:07.542
and the surgeons also divided the body up
into different parts that they worked on

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.820
and gave themselves different names.

00:02:10.925 --> 00:02:13.695
And then, of course,
there was intensive care.

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:17.394
And 25 years after my grandfather died,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.721
I became an intensive care specialist
in a large London teaching hospital.

00:02:23.028 --> 00:02:26.277
And I thought I could keep
people alive forever.

00:02:26.277 --> 00:02:28.827
These were the early days
of intensive care.

00:02:29.322 --> 00:02:32.392
I thought it was infinite,
what we could be doing.

00:02:32.471 --> 00:02:35.911
And in many ways, in some ways, it is.

00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:41.357
If I had a relatively normal
brain and a liver,

00:02:41.357 --> 00:02:43.387
I could keep everything else going.

00:02:43.882 --> 00:02:46.706
At that time I had
six intensive care beds.

00:02:47.485 --> 00:02:52.925
I now work in an intensive care unit
where there are 40 intensive care beds.

00:02:53.345 --> 00:02:57.395
4000 Australian dollars
per patient per day.

00:02:58.045 --> 00:03:01.675
But it's not only the number of beds
that have changed,

00:03:01.676 --> 00:03:05.726
it's also the type of patients 
that we're treating now in intensive care.

00:03:06.924 --> 00:03:09.254
Many of them are over the age of 60,

00:03:10.052 --> 00:03:12.889
many of them are in their 80s and 90s,

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:17.359
and many of those are
in the last few days or weeks of life.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.150
So how did this happen?

00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:22.471
Well, it's sort of like a conveyor belt.

00:03:22.873 --> 00:03:25.773
With my grandfather,
he got sick in the community,

00:03:25.908 --> 00:03:29.828
it was expected that he got treated
and managed at home.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.991
If you get sick
in the community these days,

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:36.951
we almost always call an ambulance.

00:03:36.951 --> 00:03:41.781
It's very frightening
to have someone become very sick.

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.549
The ambulance takes you
to the nearest emergency department.

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.429
Emergency departments are highly stressed.

00:03:48.818 --> 00:03:51.648
They resuscitate you, they package you,

00:03:51.992 --> 00:03:55.652
and they get you ready 
for admission to the hospital.

00:03:56.678 --> 00:03:59.308
And then you become
even sicker in the hospital.

00:03:59.453 --> 00:04:03.929
And here I am,
at the end of the conveyor belt,

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:06.829
in the intensive care unit,
waiting for you.

00:04:08.376 --> 00:04:12.486
This is a picture of my mother
and my brothers and sisters.

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:16.819
It wasn't the same
as my grandfather, for my mother.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.520
The last six months of her life,

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:23.056
she was admitted 22 times
to acute hospitals.

00:04:23.947 --> 00:04:27.597
She wasn't told
what exactly was wrong with her.

00:04:27.957 --> 00:04:29.965
People didn't tell her

00:04:29.971 --> 00:04:33.714
that as you get older,
things start to deteriorate,

00:04:34.223 --> 00:04:35.493
and you become sicker.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.860
She wasn't given any choice about this.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.120
It was simply she got sick,
and she got put on this conveyor belt,

00:04:43.368 --> 00:04:44.888
admitted to hospital.

00:04:45.921 --> 00:04:49.911
I had to be a son
in those situations, not a doctor,

00:04:50.282 --> 00:04:53.782
so I didn't interfere
with any of those decisions

00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:57.571
until finally a very special doctor
sat us all down and said,

00:04:57.756 --> 00:05:00.566
"Your mother is old, and she's dying,

00:05:01.205 --> 00:05:03.075
and we should let her go in peace."

00:05:03.387 --> 00:05:05.757
That was such a relief for all of us,

00:05:06.136 --> 00:05:08.326
and of course,
it was a relief for my mother.

00:05:08.326 --> 00:05:11.285
And so, 48 hours,
approximately, after that,

00:05:11.285 --> 00:05:14.245
my mother passed very comfortably away.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.750
What did my mother die of?

00:05:17.452 --> 00:05:21.782
Well, when I was an intern,
we were allowed to write down "old age,"

00:05:22.203 --> 00:05:24.467
but we're not allowed to do that any more.

00:05:24.467 --> 00:05:26.267
We have to make up a medical term.

00:05:26.363 --> 00:05:27.745
So for example,

00:05:27.745 --> 00:05:29.773
everyone that dies, their heart stops,

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:32.290
so we write down
"cardio vascular disease."

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.617
So cardio vascular disease

00:05:34.617 --> 00:05:37.437
is the most common way of dying
in our community.

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:40.007
(Laughter)

00:05:40.737 --> 00:05:44.577
What was really troubling for me was
that my mother kept asking me,

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:46.071
"What is wrong with me, Ken?

00:05:46.071 --> 00:05:48.311
If only they'd find out
what was wrong with me,

00:05:48.924 --> 00:05:50.794
then we could do something about it."

00:05:51.152 --> 00:05:53.622
This is very difficult to explain

00:05:54.557 --> 00:05:58.193
because when you get old, you get sick,

00:05:58.193 --> 00:06:01.673
and it's very difficult to put your finger
on exactly what's happening.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.940
And also, medicine
is based on the diagnosis.

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:08.655
That's what we learn about for six years:

00:06:08.655 --> 00:06:10.375
the diagnosis.

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:12.239
A single diagnosis.

00:06:12.461 --> 00:06:14.281
Hospitals are wonderful places

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:17.686
if you have a single problem
that can be fixed.

00:06:18.854 --> 00:06:21.424
However, when you become old,

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.527
the combination of all the so-called
chronic diseases or co-morbidities -

00:06:26.527 --> 00:06:28.957
whatever the medicalized word is -

00:06:28.957 --> 00:06:30.667
add up to something

00:06:30.667 --> 00:06:33.694
that as yet, we haven't got
a name or a number for.

00:06:35.023 --> 00:06:36.713
I like this word: frailty.

00:06:37.176 --> 00:06:39.906
Because it comes at it
from the patient's point of view.

00:06:40.265 --> 00:06:42.555
It's not a series of medicalized terms,

00:06:42.765 --> 00:06:43.935
it's frailty.

00:06:44.347 --> 00:06:49.397
And I'm sure many of you in the audience
have experienced people that are older,

00:06:49.531 --> 00:06:51.825
and you know what happens
as you get frail,

00:06:51.825 --> 00:06:53.425
as you get more frail.

00:06:53.677 --> 00:06:57.427
And I particularly like this frailty score
because it' got nice pictures.

00:06:57.547 --> 00:06:59.021
So you start off at number one,

00:06:59.021 --> 00:07:01.226
you are very fit
in your sixties, seventies,

00:07:01.446 --> 00:07:04.256
and then you gradually
get more and more frail,

00:07:04.366 --> 00:07:05.936
more and more vulnerable.

00:07:06.248 --> 00:07:09.141
Until you find it
very difficult to get around,

00:07:09.141 --> 00:07:11.646
until you become even more vulnerable.

00:07:11.646 --> 00:07:13.522
Then you are confined to a wheelchair,

00:07:13.522 --> 00:07:17.342
and finally, you haven't got
the strength to get out of bed.

00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:21.899
Despite all the specialties
and all the drugs

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:24.479
and all the marvelous things
we can do in medicine,

00:07:24.817 --> 00:07:28.397
age-related frailty is not curable.

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:32.234
So TED Talks are not only
about the problem,

00:07:32.234 --> 00:07:33.834
they are also about the solution,

00:07:33.834 --> 00:07:35.767
and what I'd like to talk to you about

00:07:35.767 --> 00:07:39.447
is what we are trying to do about it
in my own hospital.

00:07:41.213 --> 00:07:47.783
It's not really about high technology
or IT or anything like that.

00:07:47.794 --> 00:07:49.544
It's not fancy stuff.

00:07:49.544 --> 00:07:52.584
But I'm very fortunate
to work in an organization

00:07:53.186 --> 00:07:56.216
that has a culture of looking at things
in a different way,

00:07:56.843 --> 00:08:00.696
putting the patient in the center,
rubbing all the other things out,

00:08:00.696 --> 00:08:03.316
and thinking, well,
how can we do this in a better way.

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:07.728
So, believe it or not,

00:08:07.745 --> 00:08:10.684
doctors in hospitals
find it very, very difficult

00:08:10.684 --> 00:08:12.944
to recognize people at the end of life.

00:08:13.598 --> 00:08:16.048
I know that sounds very hard to believe.

00:08:16.709 --> 00:08:20.196
So we are working on a tool
that gives us some idea

00:08:20.204 --> 00:08:23.437
about people that have got months
or perhaps a year to live.

00:08:23.437 --> 00:08:24.877
It's called the crystal tool.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.720
It's very simple, can be used
by people at the bedside.

00:08:29.752 --> 00:08:32.877
It's just a combination
of things that are logical,

00:08:32.877 --> 00:08:35.967
like age and the frailty score
and things like that.

00:08:36.971 --> 00:08:41.650
Now, with everything
that we do in medicine,

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:42.890
there's uncertainty.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.280
Uncertainty is inherent in medicine.

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:51.722
So take, for example, a 20-year-old person
with a terminal brain tumor -

00:08:51.724 --> 00:08:54.604
we do all the tests,
and we find that it's terminal.

00:08:55.141 --> 00:08:56.293
The first thing we do -

00:08:56.293 --> 00:08:58.640
well, the first thing
the person wants to know is,

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.120
"How long I've got to live?"

00:09:00.405 --> 00:09:05.069
So just using all the data we've got 
of everyone with that particular tumor,

00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:07.229
we can say, "Well, maybe a year.

00:09:08.066 --> 00:09:09.326
It could be six months.

00:09:09.343 --> 00:09:10.613
It could be two years.

00:09:10.897 --> 00:09:14.642
Maybe, in exceptional circumstances,
it may be three years,

00:09:14.642 --> 00:09:19.602
but the disease is terminal,
and we can't do much about it."

00:09:19.815 --> 00:09:21.875
And it's the same thing with the elderly.

00:09:22.744 --> 00:09:28.123
Some score like this will at least able us
to move to the next stage.

00:09:29.226 --> 00:09:31.546
And the next stage
is not rocket science either.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.300
But believe it or not,

00:09:33.351 --> 00:09:38.441
doctors are very uncomfortable
talking to elderly people about dying.

00:09:38.946 --> 00:09:40.736
I'm not too sure why that is.

00:09:41.217 --> 00:09:46.797
So the next step after we recognize
these people is to begin a discussion

00:09:47.276 --> 00:09:49.896
in an honest and empathetic way.

00:09:51.297 --> 00:09:54.105
The next step after that is also logical,

00:09:54.105 --> 00:09:56.636
but believe it or not,
this doesn't occur either.

00:09:56.636 --> 00:10:00.586
It's to empower the patients
and their carers with choices.

00:10:01.175 --> 00:10:04.385
So you'd be honest about
where we think they are in life,

00:10:04.757 --> 00:10:08.827
how long they've got to live,
and how would they like to live that life.

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:11.773
Maybe they'd like to keep
coming in and out of hospital,

00:10:11.773 --> 00:10:15.113
maybe they'd like the most
aggressive treatment available,

00:10:15.407 --> 00:10:18.605
but at least, it would be
based on proper data

00:10:18.605 --> 00:10:21.135
and a proper way to make a decision.

00:10:22.037 --> 00:10:24.697
However, many people, we've found,

00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:27.398
don't want to keep coming
in and out of hospital

00:10:27.675 --> 00:10:30.365
once they know they haven't got
terribly long to live.

00:10:30.887 --> 00:10:33.979
In fact, about 70% of people,

00:10:34.441 --> 00:10:37.451
in this country, in America
and the United Kingdom,

00:10:37.757 --> 00:10:40.637
when are asked, would rather die at home.

00:10:41.476 --> 00:10:43.647
Now, this contrasts with,

00:10:44.247 --> 00:10:49.734
about 70% of you will die
in acute institutions, in hospitals.

00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:52.099
So there's a discrepancy here,

00:10:52.444 --> 00:10:54.234
which sort of reinforces the fact

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:57.723
that we are not talking to people
about this in the proper fashion.

00:10:59.635 --> 00:11:02.045
The long term solutions
are not in hospitals.

00:11:02.215 --> 00:11:04.495
The long term solutions are things like

00:11:04.787 --> 00:11:07.707
putting the family doctor
more in the center of care;

00:11:07.895 --> 00:11:09.785
advance care directives,

00:11:10.023 --> 00:11:13.183
you need to be thinking about this
while you're able to,

00:11:13.437 --> 00:11:15.867
talking with your loved ones
and writing it down.

00:11:16.791 --> 00:11:21.131
But then we also need
to move resources and support people,

00:11:21.131 --> 00:11:23.376
if they are going to die in the home,

00:11:23.376 --> 00:11:25.621
so that they are looked after,

00:11:26.113 --> 00:11:28.336
so that they've got respite care.

00:11:29.669 --> 00:11:33.629
I'd like to be controversial here
and say that I don't believe

00:11:34.041 --> 00:11:38.795
the last few months or year of life
in a very elderly person

00:11:38.795 --> 00:11:40.525
is a medical challenge.

00:11:41.255 --> 00:11:44.385
Maybe if they've got pain,
or they are uncomfortable - sure.

00:11:44.413 --> 00:11:48.263
But most of it is about community support:

00:11:48.428 --> 00:11:50.108
facilitating the carers,

00:11:50.672 --> 00:11:53.672
making sure their house is clean,
making sure they've got food,

00:11:53.684 --> 00:11:55.310
making sure they're washed

00:11:55.795 --> 00:11:57.657
and all of those sorts of things.

00:11:57.657 --> 00:12:00.957
This is not so much a health
or medical problem.

00:12:02.774 --> 00:12:05.575
So dying in the elderly has been hijacked.

00:12:07.082 --> 00:12:10.157
Patients are divided
into individual organs,

00:12:10.157 --> 00:12:14.207
and we try to fine-tune
and make these individual organs better.

00:12:15.379 --> 00:12:18.607
A little bit like birthing was
in the 50s or 60s,

00:12:18.607 --> 00:12:20.207
which was also hijacked.

00:12:20.215 --> 00:12:22.046
Women in labor were taken to hospital,

00:12:22.046 --> 00:12:25.147
strung up, legs apart, baby taken out,

00:12:25.147 --> 00:12:27.397
baby put in with all the other babies,

00:12:27.696 --> 00:12:29.936
fathers not allowed
to be with their wives,

00:12:29.947 --> 00:12:32.127
fathers not even allowed to hold the baby.

00:12:32.128 --> 00:12:36.245
This was the normal way
that we conducted birthing

00:12:36.249 --> 00:12:37.677
in the 50s and 60s.

00:12:37.677 --> 00:12:41.556
That's similar to what's happening
with the elderly at the moment.

00:12:42.898 --> 00:12:44.998
So this is where many of you will die:

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.610
surrounded by high technology,

00:12:47.797 --> 00:12:50.737
cared for by well-meaning people

00:12:51.108 --> 00:12:55.648
with a lot of expertise
in their own particular area.

00:12:57.973 --> 00:12:59.841
It's also

00:13:00.796 --> 00:13:05.183
that we hear about medical miracles
almost on a daily basis,

00:13:05.183 --> 00:13:06.823
and that's exciting.

00:13:07.369 --> 00:13:11.439
But we hear about what health can do,
what modern medicine can do,

00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:15.679
but we don't hear very much
about what modern medicine can't do.

00:13:15.686 --> 00:13:18.756
We need to be far more honest
with our community

00:13:19.094 --> 00:13:21.754
about the limitations of modern medicine.

00:13:23.185 --> 00:13:28.236
There's rarely a day goes by
when I do my ward rounds with colleagues

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:33.647
that one of us doesn't say, "Please,
don't ever let this happen to me!"

00:13:34.643 --> 00:13:38.225
So this is one of the most important
decisions in your life.

00:13:38.225 --> 00:13:42.525
You need to take control
over your own end of life.

00:13:43.311 --> 00:13:44.691
Thank you very much.

00:13:44.788 --> 00:13:48.379
