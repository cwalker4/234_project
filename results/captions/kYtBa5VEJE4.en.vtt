BIG NEWS-- THERE'S BIG NEWS LAST
NIGHT OUT OF THE MUELLER

00:00:07.873 --> 00:00:08.941 align:start position:0%
INVESTIGATION.

00:00:08.974 --> 00:00:10.142 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE LATE LAST NIGHT, THE
SPECIAL COUNSEL DROPPED A

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:14.047
SENTENCING RECOMMENDATION FOR
FORMER TRUMP NATIONAL SECURITY

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.386 align:start position:0%
ADVISOR AND DAD WHO'S NOT ANGRY,
ANGRY, MICHAEL FLYNN.

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:21.988 size:88% position:44%
NOW, YOU'LL RECALL THAT LAST
YEAR FLYNN PLEADED GUILTY TO

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:24.223 align:start position:0%
LYING TO THE F.B.I. ABOUT
CONVERSATIONS HE HAD WITH THE

00:00:24.256 --> 00:00:29.729 align:start position:0%
RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED
STATES, SERGEY KISLYAK, JUST

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:32.231 align:start position:0%
INAUGURATION.

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:34.333
YES, TRUMP'S TEAM WAS READY ON
DAY ONE TO LIE ABOUT WHAT THEY

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.335 align:start position:0%
DID ON DAY TWO.

00:00:36.368 --> 00:00:39.605 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )</i>
ACCORDING TO MUELLER, FLYNN

00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:44.477
HELPED SUBSTANTIALLY WITH THE
SPECIAL COUNSEL'S INVESTIGATION

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.979 align:start position:0%
AND SHOULD RECEIVE LITTLE OR NO
PRISON TIME.

00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:51.517 align:start position:0%
MY, MY-- HE MUST HAVE GIVEN THEM
SOMETHING REALLY GOOD.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.790 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )</i>
IF BY "REALLY GOOD," YOU MEAN

00:00:57.823 --> 00:01:05.498
REALLY BAD, AND I USUALLY DO.

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:11.003 align:start position:0%
OH, WHAT COULD THEY BE?

00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:12.672 align:start position:0%
SECRET COMMUNIQUES?

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:14.774 align:start position:0%
ENCRYPTED EMAILS?

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:15.475 size:84% position:42%
A NOTE FROM TRUMP TO PUTIN?

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:16.009 size:81% position:41%
"WILL YOU COLLUDE WITH ME?

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:17.610 align:start position:0%

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:19.579 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )
 ( APPLAUSE )</i>

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:19.946 align:start position:0%
YES.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.315 align:start position:0%
I THINK YES.

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:23.783 size:75% position:38%
WE SHOULD CHECK THE YES.

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:24.817 align:start position:0%
YES.

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:30.056 align:start position:0%
<i> ( APPLAUSE )</i>
AND THAT CAN'T BE ALL FLYNN TOLD

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:31.924 align:start position:0%
THEM, BECAUSE HE HAD 19
INTERVIEWS WITH MUELLER'S

00:01:31.957 --> 00:01:33.259 align:start position:0%
OFFICE.

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:36.329 align:start position:0%
SO WHAT EXACTLY DID FLYNN TELL
MUELLER?

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:37.463 size:75% position:38%
WELL, LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:38.364 size:84% position:42%
"THE DEFENDANT HAS PROVIDED
SUBSTANTIAL ASSISTANCE IN A

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:41.934 size:75% position:38%
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION."

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:44.003 size:88% position:44%
AND THE REST IS BLACKED OUT.

00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:46.973
WHEN DONALD TRUMP COMPLAINED
THIS INVESTIGATION WAS COSTING

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:50.643 align:start position:0%
US MILLIONS, I DIDN'T KNOW HE
MEANT IN TONER.

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:54.247 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )</i>
BY THE WAY, THAT'S WHAT EVERY

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.817 align:start position:0%
TRUMP STAFFER'S RESUME IS GOING
TO LOOK LIKE AFTER THIS.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.686 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )</i>
"OKAY, MR. MNUCHIN, WHERE DID

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.925 align:start position:0%
YOU WORK FROM 2016 TO 2019?"
"THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL."

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:12.465 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )</i>
OF COURSE, NOT EVERYONE THINKS

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:14.167 align:start position:0%
THAT FLYNN'S SENTENCING
RECOMMENDATION LOOKS DAMNING.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.405
TAKE REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN AND
MAN WHO THINKS HE'S TALKING ON

00:02:19.438 --> 00:02:25.111 align:start position:0%
THE PHONE RIGHT NOW, MARK
MEADOWS.

00:02:25.144 --> 00:02:26.779
MEADOWS WENT ON THE FOX NEWS TO
SAY HOW THIS WHOLE FLYNN THING

00:02:26.812 --> 00:02:27.947 size:88% position:44%
IS ACTUALLY GREAT FOR TRUMP.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.617
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S GOOD NEWS FOR
PRESIDENT TRUMP TONIGHT THAT

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.152 align:start position:0%
THIS IS WHAT IT'S COME DOWN TO--
EVEN THOUGH THEY SAID HE

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:35.555 align:start position:0%
SUBSTANTIALLY COOPERATED, I
THINK HE SUBSTANTIALLY

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:38.024 align:start position:0%
COOPERATED TO SAY THAT THERE WAS
NO COLLUSION.

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:40.259 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: "YEAH, YOU SEE?

00:02:40.292 --> 00:02:42.161
FLYNN SPENT THOSE ALL HOURS
TELLING MUELLER THE MANY WAYS

00:02:42.194 --> 00:02:43.062 align:start position:0%
TRUMP DIDN'T COLLUDE!

00:02:43.095 --> 00:02:45.798 align:start position:0%
IT'S JUST 19 HOURS OF REDACTED
INNOCENCE."

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:48.367 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )</i>
AND YOU KNOW WHO AGREES?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.237 align:start position:0%
STEVE DOOCY OVER AT "FOX &amp;
FRIENDS."

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.606
&gt;&gt; THIS WAS ESSENTIALLY THE
POINT PERSON THERE DURING THE

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.542 align:start position:0%
TRANSITION.

00:02:56.575 --> 00:02:58.978 align:start position:0%
AND IF HE'S GETTING ZERO JAIL
TIME, THAT SHOULD TELL YOU A LOT

00:02:59.011 --> 00:03:02.615
ABOUT THE STATE OF COLLUSION.

00:03:02.648 --> 00:03:04.617
&gt;&gt; BUT, STEVE, BUT HE GOT IT
BECAUSE THEY CLAIM THAT HE IS

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.151 align:start position:0%
COOPERATING.

00:03:05.184 --> 00:03:06.252 align:start position:0%
SO, WHAT DID HE SAY?

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:07.954 align:start position:0%
WE DON'T KNOW, BECAUSE MOST OF
THIS STUFF IS REDACTED.

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:09.722 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; BUT WHERE IS THE COLLUSION
PART?

00:03:09.755 --> 00:03:11.924 size:88% position:44%
THERE IS NO MENTION OF THAT.

00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:13.092
&gt;&gt; BUT THERE'S NO REPORT YET!

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:16.729 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THERE'S NO MENTION OF
COLLUSION SO FAR.

00:03:16.762 --> 00:03:17.496 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  ).</i>

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.664 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IT'S TRUE, IT'S
TRUE.

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:19.532 align:start position:0%
GOOD POINT.

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:22.401 size:81% position:41%
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT.

00:03:22.434 --> 00:03:26.105 size:75% position:38%
IT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT.

00:03:26.138 --> 00:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
IT'S LIKE THE OLD SAYING, "SEE
NO EVIL.

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:29.709 size:75% position:38%
OKAY, NO EVIL, I GUESS."

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:30.743 align:start position:0%
WHAT DOES HE THINK IS UNDER ALL
THOSE BLACK BARS?

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:32.845 align:start position:0%
JUST NIPPLES?

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:34.814 align:start position:0%
WHAT'S UNDER THERE?

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:37.283 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )</i>
ALSO-- BY THE WAY, HAVE YOU EVER

00:03:37.316 --> 00:03:40.853 align:start position:0%
SHOPPED AT "JUST NIPPLES?"
&gt;&gt; Jon: NO.

00:03:40.886 --> 00:03:41.487 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: DON'T.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.690 size:81% position:41%
THEY ALSO HAVE HOUSEWARES.

00:03:44.723 --> 00:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
ALSO, NOT BUYING IT WAS TRUMP
LAWYER AND PHANTOM OF THE

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:49.362
ADMINISTRATION, RUDY GIULIANI.

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:55.067
GIULIANI WAS UNIMPRESSED WITH
MUELLER'S WORK, AND HE TEXTED A

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.303
STAFFER AT "POLITICO": "WOW BIG
CRIME FOR A SPECIAL WHATEVER."

00:03:57.336 --> 00:04:00.806 align:start position:0%
"SPECIAL WHATEVER"?

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:03.542 align:start position:0%
I THINK GIULIANI HAS ENTERED HIS
"MEAN GIRL" PHASE.

00:04:03.575 --> 00:04:09.282 align:start position:0%

"WHATEVER.

AND A FEW DAYS AGO GIULIANI

00:04:36.108 --> 00:04:41.947 align:start position:0%
TWEETED: "MUELLER FILED AN
