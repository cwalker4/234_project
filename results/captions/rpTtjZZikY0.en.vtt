00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:05.830
"THE FIVE" ."

00:00:05.831 --> 00:00:07.498
WHAT A WEEK FOR THE DEMS.

HARRIS AND THE COFFEE GUY.

00:00:18.844 --> 00:00:21.645
WHEN OBAMA RAN, THE PRESS

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:23.747
SHOUTED WE ALL KNOW IT'S OBAMA.

00:00:23.748 --> 00:00:26.417
EVERYONE COME OUT OF THE POOL.

00:00:26.418 --> 00:00:28.419
LATER, THEY KNEW IT WOULD BE

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.821
HILLARY UNTIL THE ORANGE

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:32.022
GODZILLA AMBUSHED THEM.

00:00:32.023 --> 00:00:34.658
HE SHOWED US IT'S NOT HARD TO

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.695
AMBUSH A MOB, ESPECIALLY A MOB

00:00:37.696 --> 00:00:38.395
OF LEMMINGS.

00:00:38.396 --> 00:00:40.231
JUMP OFF A CLIFF AND THEY WILL

00:00:40.232 --> 00:00:41.065
JUMP OFF.

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.434
THIS YEAR, IT IS KAMALA'S TURN.

00:00:43.435 --> 00:00:46.637
I HEARD IT FROM THE LEMMINGS.

00:00:46.638 --> 00:00:48.072
&gt;&gt; SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS KICKED

00:00:48.073 --> 00:00:49.473
OFF HER 2020 PRESIDENTIAL

00:00:49.474 --> 00:00:49.840
CAMPAIGN.

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:52.409
LOOK AT THE CROWD.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.811
SHE WAS STRONG, JOE.

00:00:53.812 --> 00:00:54.612
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

00:00:54.613 --> 00:00:56.580
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT

00:00:56.581 --> 00:00:58.616
THE SECOND THAT I SAW HER UP

00:00:58.617 --> 00:01:00.351
THERE, I SAID WOW.

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:04.021
SHE'S GOT WHAT IT TAKES.

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:04.655
SHE FILLED THAT STAGE.

00:01:04.656 --> 00:01:07.958
SHE COMPLAINED THE BIG LEAGUES.

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:13.697
&gt;&gt; Greg: THEY ARE A GOOD JAVA MN

00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:18.402
IS HAVING A HARD TIME.

00:01:18.403 --> 00:01:22.139
&gt;&gt; DON'T HELP ELECT TRUMP.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.342

GO BACK TO DAVOS WITH THE OTHER

00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:37.021
BILLIONAIRE ELITES.

00:01:37.022 --> 00:01:38.055
&gt;&gt; Greg: SOMEONE GOT A DAY

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:40.624
PASS FROM THE HOME.

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:43.060
OF COURSE, THERE IS "THE VIEW."

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:45.629
&gt;&gt; YOUR ENTRY INTO THIS RACE

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.498
WILL GUARANTEE TRUMP ANOTHER

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:48.065
FOUR YEARS.

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:50.067
&gt;&gt; I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU.

00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:52.469
&gt;&gt; I KNOW YOU DON'T.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.838
&gt;&gt; IF HE RUNS AGAINST A FAR LEFT

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:58.642
PROGRESSIVE PERSON WHO IS

00:01:58.643 --> 00:02:00.244
SUGGESTING 60, 70% TAX INCREASES

00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:00.945
ON THE RICH AND A HEALTH CARE

00:02:00.946 --> 00:02:03.847
SYSTEM THAT WE CAN'T PAY FOR,

00:02:03.848 --> 00:02:05.249
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO GET

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.616
REELECTED.

00:02:05.617 --> 00:02:07.218
NO ONE WANTS TO SEE HIM FIRED

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.853
MORE THAN ME.

00:02:09.854 --> 00:02:12.022
&gt;&gt; I KNOW ONE WANTS TO SEE YOU

00:02:12.023 --> 00:02:12.623
RUN MORE THAN HIM.

00:02:12.624 --> 00:02:14.858
&gt;&gt; Greg: SHE IS LIKE A COLD

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:15.793
CUP OF COFFEE.

00:02:15.794 --> 00:02:17.494
YOU HEAR THE FEAR IN THEIR

00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:17.828
VOICES.

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.063
JAVA MAN WANTS TO DO WHAT TRUMP

00:02:19.064 --> 00:02:24.768
DID, SAY SURPRISING THINGS ABOU

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:25.102
ABOUT --

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:26.237
THE MOB FEARS IF HE RUNS AS AN

00:02:26.238 --> 00:02:27.871
INDEPENDENT HE WILL TAKE VOTES

00:02:27.872 --> 00:02:30.874
FROM KAMALA.

00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:32.643
HANDING A WIN TO TRUMP.

00:02:32.644 --> 00:02:33.410
THEY ARE RIGHT.

00:02:33.411 --> 00:02:38.315
SCHULTZ IS AN OLD-SCHOOL LIB AND

00:02:38.316 --> 00:02:39.850
BY SHOWING NEXT TO THE

00:02:39.851 --> 00:02:41.151
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, HE SHOWS HOW

00:02:41.152 --> 00:02:43.854
FAR LEFT THEY'VE BECOME.

00:02:43.855 --> 00:02:45.222
HE'S NOT A SOCIALIST PROMISING

00:02:45.223 --> 00:02:47.024
PIE IN THE SKY B.S.

00:02:47.025 --> 00:02:48.826
HE IS SAYING, THE SOLUTION FOR

00:02:48.827 --> 00:02:50.661
THE DEMS, PICK ONE LIKE HIM SO

00:02:50.662 --> 00:02:51.929
NO ONE FLOCKED TO HIM OR LOOK

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.930
HOW WE RUN.

00:02:52.931 --> 00:02:54.865
HE'S COMMITTING THE CARDINAL

00:02:54.866 --> 00:02:55.633
SIN.

00:02:55.634 --> 00:02:56.467
GOING EMPTY THE MEDIA'S

00:02:56.468 --> 00:02:58.769
PREORDAINED CHOICE.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.205
&gt;&gt; YOU JUST PLAYED

00:03:01.206 --> 00:03:02.473
SENATOR HARRIS SAYING THAT SHE

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:04.808
WANTS TO ABOLISH THE INSURANCE

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:05.175
INDUSTRY.

00:03:05.176 --> 00:03:06.043
THAT'S NOT CORRECT.

00:03:06.044 --> 00:03:07.845
THAT'S NOT AMERICAN.

00:03:07.846 --> 00:03:08.379
WHAT'S NEXT?

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.681
WHAT INDUSTRY ARE WE GOING TO

00:03:10.682 --> 00:03:11.849
ABOLISH NEXT?

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.150
THE COFFEE INDUSTRY?

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:14.485
&gt;&gt; Greg: BIG MISTAKE GOING

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:15.419
AFTER HER.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.321
HE WILL LAST ABOUT AS LONG AS A

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:21.025
PORK CHOP IN A PRANA TANK.

00:03:21.026 --> 00:03:24.228
I AM STARTING TO WARM UP TO THIS

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:25.429
GUY BECAUSE UNLIKE THE OTHER

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.196
PEOPLE RUNNING, HE HAS THE GUTS

00:03:26.197 --> 00:03:31.435
TO GO AFTER THE SACRED HEROES.

00:03:31.436 --> 00:03:33.137
HE'S GOING AFTER KAMALA.

00:03:33.138 --> 00:03:36.740
I WILL PLAY SOME TAPE LATER OF

00:03:36.741 --> 00:03:37.441
HIM GOING AFTER AOC.

00:03:37.442 --> 00:03:38.776
YOU SEE THE REACTION EVERYWHERE.

00:03:38.777 --> 00:03:42.446
HE'S MAKING IT HARD FOR THEM TO

00:03:42.447 --> 00:03:43.414
PROTECT THEIR CHOICE.

00:03:43.415 --> 00:03:44.615
&gt;&gt; Dana: UNITED AGAINST HIM.

00:03:44.616 --> 00:03:47.217
THE OTHER PERSON WHO WENT AFTER

00:03:47.218 --> 00:03:50.621
THE LEFT BY NAME, I THINK AOC,

00:03:50.622 --> 00:03:51.221
MAYBE ELIZABETH WARREN.

00:03:51.222 --> 00:03:53.691
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG.

00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:54.858
THEY ARE INDEPENDENT GUYS.

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.361
WAIT, WE DON'T WANT TO GO THAT

00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:57.828
WAY.

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.297
THEY FREAK OUT ON THE LEFT IS

00:04:00.298 --> 00:04:01.031
QUITE DRAMATIC AND I THINK THEY

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:06.837
ARE LOOKING TO SAY MY GOODNESS.

00:04:06.838 --> 00:04:08.038
YOU'RE GOING TO ELECT

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.472
DONALD TRUMP.

00:04:08.473 --> 00:04:09.640
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:12.042
I THINK IT'S JUST AS POSSIBLE IT

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:13.177
COULD HURT TRUMP.

00:04:13.178 --> 00:04:17.548
IF YOU LOOK AT 1992, SOME PEOPLE

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.816
SAY ROSS PEROT DIDN'T HAVE AN

00:04:18.817 --> 00:04:21.018
EFFECT BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.853
THE DATA, BUSH WON TEXAS AND

00:04:22.854 --> 00:04:23.187
FLORIDA.

00:04:23.188 --> 00:04:25.389
IT DIDN'T MATTER IN THE END.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.125
BUT COULD IT MATTER THIS TIME?

00:04:28.126 --> 00:04:32.629
THAT'S HOW YOU ELECTED

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.063
BILL CLINTON.

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:35.632
&gt;&gt; Greg: IT'S HARD TO REMEMBER

00:04:35.633 --> 00:04:35.899
'92.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.234
I WAS LIKE 14.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:38.736
&gt;&gt; Dana: YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE

00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:39.103
TO SHAVE.

00:04:39.104 --> 00:04:41.338
&gt;&gt; Greg: I WANTED TO.

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:44.208
&gt;&gt; Jesse: YOU WERE OLDER THAN

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:45.242
14.

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:46.043
&gt;&gt; Jedediah: THE FIRST

00:04:46.044 --> 00:04:48.178
ELECTION I EVER VOTED IN.

00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:48.746
&gt;&gt; Greg: INTERESTING.

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:50.247
I DIDN'T ASK FOR THAT

00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:52.282
INFORMATION BUT THAT'S OKAY.

00:04:52.283 --> 00:04:54.051
WHEN "THE VIEW" HAS A NASTY

00:04:54.052 --> 00:04:56.286
REACTION TO SOMEONE, I INSTANTLY

00:04:56.287 --> 00:04:57.287
LIKED THAT PERSON A LOT.

00:04:57.288 --> 00:04:59.523
&gt;&gt; Jesse: I LIKE THIS GUY,

00:04:59.524 --> 00:04:59.857
SCHULTZ.

00:04:59.858 --> 00:05:01.859
HE LETS ME USE HIS BATHROOMS AT

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:02.226
STARBUCKS.

00:05:02.227 --> 00:05:04.695
DO THAT AND I WILL VOTE FOR YOU.

00:05:04.696 --> 00:05:06.497
I DON'T LIKE ORDERING THE CUP --

00:05:06.498 --> 00:05:10.267
I WANT TO SAY SMALL.

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:15.339
&gt;&gt; Dana: VENTI IS LARGE.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.873
&gt;&gt; Jesse: EXACTLY.

00:05:15.874 --> 00:05:18.275
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:19.443
WHAT LANGUAGE IS IT?

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:21.678
HE SAW THIS RADICAL YELLING

00:05:21.679 --> 00:05:22.946
THINGS.

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:27.117
THEY ARE TRYING TO DURING THE

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.652
TERM BILLIONAIRE INTO A SLUR.

00:05:28.653 --> 00:05:29.386
LIKE IT INHERENTLY MAKES YOU A

00:05:29.387 --> 00:05:31.455
BAD PERSON.

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:32.489
THIS GUY IS A SELF-MADE

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.890
BILLIONAIRE.

00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:35.259
HE GREW UP IN THE PROJECTS IN

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.460
BROOKLYN WHERE HIS FATHER WAS A

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:38.061
TRUCK DRIVER.

00:05:38.062 --> 00:05:39.830
HE CREATED STARBUCKS OUT OF

00:05:39.831 --> 00:05:40.164
NOTHING.

00:05:40.165 --> 00:05:42.032
THE LEFT LOVES STARBUCKS.

00:05:42.033 --> 00:05:44.034
THEY PAY THEIR PEOPLE WELL.

00:05:44.035 --> 00:05:46.170
THEY GET GREAT HEALTH INSURANCE.

00:05:46.171 --> 00:05:48.839
EVERYBODY USED TO LOVE HIM AND

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.240
NOW THEY WANT TO BOYCOTT

00:05:50.241 --> 00:05:52.476
STARBUCKS BECAUSE HE COULD BE

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:53.744
THE SPOILER AND ENSURE A

00:05:53.745 --> 00:05:55.846
DONALD TRUMP SECOND TERM.

00:05:55.847 --> 00:05:57.181
THEY ARE ON SUICIDE WATCH NOW

00:05:57.182 --> 00:05:59.016
BECAUSE THE GUY HAS ENOUGH GO TO

00:05:59.017 --> 00:06:01.285
GET ON THE BALLOT IN ALL 50

00:06:01.286 --> 00:06:02.085
STATES.

00:06:02.086 --> 00:06:05.622
BLANKET THE AIRWAVES WITH

00:06:05.623 --> 00:06:06.657
ADVERTISING.

00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:07.191
TOTAL MELTDOWN.

00:06:07.192 --> 00:06:09.426
&gt;&gt; Greg: JUAN, I THINK THAT

00:06:09.427 --> 00:06:11.028
HOWARD IS A LOT LIKE YOU IN THIS

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:12.830
SENSE THAT HE'S AN OLD-SCHOOL

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:13.831
DEMOCRAT WITHOUT A PARTY.

00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:15.666
YOUR PARTY IS GOING WAY FAR

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:16.233
LEFT.

00:06:16.234 --> 00:06:18.035
I THINK IT'S BEEN HARD FOR YOU.

00:06:18.036 --> 00:06:19.570
I AM LIKE AN ANALYST.

00:06:19.571 --> 00:06:20.704
I KNOW IT'S BEEN HARD FOR YOU

00:06:20.705 --> 00:06:22.706
WITH YOUR DEMOCRATS.

00:06:22.707 --> 00:06:24.475
TELL ME HOW YOU REALLY FEEL.

00:06:24.476 --> 00:06:26.243
DON'T YOU THINK HE IS SOUNDING

00:06:26.244 --> 00:06:28.245
LIKE A DEMOCRAT FROM THE '70s

00:06:28.246 --> 00:06:30.948
OR '80s OR EVEN '90s.

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:32.549
&gt;&gt; Juan: HE IS LIKE ME IN THIS

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.883
REGARD.

00:06:32.884 --> 00:06:35.652
WE BOTH GREW UP IN BROOKLYN AND

00:06:35.653 --> 00:06:36.453
THE PROJECTS.

00:06:36.454 --> 00:06:39.056
I DIDN'T BECOME A BILLIONAIRE.

00:06:39.057 --> 00:06:39.957
&gt;&gt; Jedediah: NOT YET.

00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.358
&gt;&gt; Juan: HE SAYS THINGS ABOUT

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:42.860
ELIZABETH WARREN THAT I FIND

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:43.660
STRANGE.

00:06:43.661 --> 00:06:46.630
HE SAYS ELIZABETH WARREN'S

00:06:46.631 --> 00:06:48.432
IDEAS, 2% ON PEOPLE WORTH MORE

00:06:48.433 --> 00:06:48.932
THAN $50 BILLION.

00:06:48.933 --> 00:06:51.268
HE SAYS IT'S RIDICULOUS.

00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:53.070
WHY IS IT RIDICULOUS?

00:06:53.071 --> 00:06:56.173
OR HE SAYS MEDICARE FOR ALL,

00:06:56.174 --> 00:06:56.707
RIDICULOUS, STUPID.

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:57.207
IT'S UN-AMERICAN.

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:58.475
I THINK TO MYSELF, MOST

00:06:58.476 --> 00:07:00.444
AMERICANS THINK THAT'S A GOOD

00:07:00.445 --> 00:07:00.744
IDEA.

00:07:00.745 --> 00:07:02.713
&gt;&gt; Greg: HE WAS SAYING IT WAS

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:03.380
UN-AMERICAN TO GET RID OF AN

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:05.849
ENTIRE INDUSTRY.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.451
&gt;&gt; Juan: SHE DIDN'T SAY GET

00:07:07.452 --> 00:07:08.118
RID OF THE INDUSTRY.

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:10.454
SHE SAID YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO

00:07:10.455 --> 00:07:11.755
GO TO THE HOSPITAL AND NOT HAVE

00:07:11.756 --> 00:07:13.657
TO GO THROUGH, DO YOU HAVE

00:07:13.658 --> 00:07:14.658
INSURANCE?

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:16.293
WILL YOUR COMPANY COVER IT?

00:07:16.294 --> 00:07:18.462
MEDICARE FOR ALL GUARANTEE IT.

00:07:18.463 --> 00:07:19.429
&gt;&gt; Jesse: THEY TREAT PEOPLE

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.064
WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE ALL THE

00:07:21.065 --> 00:07:21.365
TIME.

00:07:21.366 --> 00:07:23.700
&gt;&gt; Juan: BUT THEN WHAT

00:07:23.701 --> 00:07:25.869
HAPPENS, YOU AND I END UP PAYING

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:26.637
HIGHER COSTS.

00:07:26.638 --> 00:07:28.272
THAT'S WHY AMERICAN MEDICAL CARE

00:07:28.273 --> 00:07:28.605
IS SO --

00:07:28.606 --> 00:07:30.173
&gt;&gt; Jesse: SO YOU WANT TO FIRE

00:07:30.174 --> 00:07:32.175
HALF A MILLION PEOPLE WHO WORK

00:07:32.176 --> 00:07:33.310
IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY?

00:07:33.311 --> 00:07:34.745
&gt;&gt; Juan: I DIDN'T WANT TO GET

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:35.646
INTO THE BAIT.

00:07:35.647 --> 00:07:40.350
I WANT TALK ABOUT HIM.

00:07:40.351 --> 00:07:43.620
THE DEMOCRATIC IDEAS, THE KEY

00:07:43.621 --> 00:07:45.155
POINT HE'S MAKING.

00:07:45.156 --> 00:07:46.056
IT'S INTERESTING STEVE SCHMIDT

00:07:46.057 --> 00:07:51.028
WHO WORKED WITH McCAIN, I

00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:53.163
THINK, GREG STRUBLE, ALSO A

00:07:53.164 --> 00:07:54.665
REPUBLICAN POLLSTER, BILL

00:07:54.666 --> 00:07:55.899
BURTON, THESE ARE HIS TOP

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:56.633
PEOPLE.

00:07:56.634 --> 00:07:57.334
THEY WERE WITH HIM YESTERDAY

00:07:57.335 --> 00:08:00.437
HERE IN NEW YORK.

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:04.841
WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HIM SAY, 40%

00:08:04.842 --> 00:08:06.643
OF AMERICANS NOW IDENTIFY AS

00:08:06.644 --> 00:08:07.044
INDEPENDENT.

00:08:07.045 --> 00:08:08.679
THEY DON'T LIKE REPUBLICANS OR

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.680
DEMOCRATS.

00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:10.380
THEY REALLY ARE INDEPENDENT.

00:08:10.381 --> 00:08:12.849
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT ANALYSIS

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.051
IS MOST INDEPENDENTS LEAN ONE

00:08:14.052 --> 00:08:14.785
WAY OR THE OTHER.

00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:17.654
AT THE MOMENT WE ARE SEEING IS

00:08:17.655 --> 00:08:18.956
HUGE NUMBERS SAYING THAT I WILL

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:21.658
NEVER VOTE FOR TRUMP.

00:08:21.659 --> 00:08:22.225
56% OF AMERICANS.

00:08:22.226 --> 00:08:24.494
&gt;&gt; Greg: YOU COULD HAVE SAID

00:08:24.495 --> 00:08:26.363
THAT AT THE START, JUAN.

00:08:26.364 --> 00:08:28.098
&gt;&gt; Juan: IF THAT'S THE CASE,

00:08:28.099 --> 00:08:29.900
HE IS COUNTING ON INDEPENDENTS

00:08:29.901 --> 00:08:31.501
WHO ARE NOT THERE FOR THE

00:08:31.502 --> 00:08:31.835
TAKING.

00:08:31.836 --> 00:08:32.669
&gt;&gt; Jedediah: I THINK HE IS

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:36.039
JUST A BUSINESSMAN.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.941
HE, MUCH LIKE TRUMP, HAS AN IDEA

00:08:37.942 --> 00:08:39.543
OF WHAT THESE POLICIES DO WHEN

00:08:39.544 --> 00:08:40.677
THEY ARE ACTUALLY IMPACTING

00:08:40.678 --> 00:08:41.278
BUSINESS.

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:42.913
WHEN YOU LOOK AT A 70% MARGINAL

00:08:42.914 --> 00:08:44.348
TAX RATE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT

00:08:44.349 --> 00:08:46.483
MEDICARE FOR ALL, ALL HE IS

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:48.652
SAYING IS IT'S UN-AMERICAN TO

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:49.886
HAVE A MASSIVE GOVERNMENT

00:08:49.887 --> 00:08:51.088
OVERTAKE OF INDUSTRY.

00:08:51.089 --> 00:08:52.589
HE KNOWS THAT IT REDUCES THE

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.825
QUALITY OF CARE OF THOSE ITEMS.

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:56.560
THE TOP TAX RATE, WHEN YOU HIKE

00:08:56.561 --> 00:08:58.562
THAT UP ON PEOPLE ON THE TOP,

00:08:58.563 --> 00:09:00.631
YOU'RE GOING TO LEAD TO JOB

00:09:00.632 --> 00:09:00.964
LOSSES.

00:09:00.965 --> 00:09:02.633
YOU'RE GOING TO LEAD TO

00:09:02.634 --> 00:09:03.433
TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS.

00:09:03.434 --> 00:09:05.268
HE'S BEEN ALIVE FOR A MINUTE.

00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:06.303
HE'S A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN

00:09:06.304 --> 00:09:07.771
AND HE IS SAYING THESE THINGS

00:09:07.772 --> 00:09:09.906
SOUND GREAT, ALL THESE SOUND

00:09:09.907 --> 00:09:10.974
BITES, THIS UTOPIA THEY WANT TO

00:09:10.975 --> 00:09:12.275
LIVE IN.

00:09:12.276 --> 00:09:13.477
WHEN YOU GET OUT OF LIBERAL

00:09:13.478 --> 00:09:14.711
ACADEMIA, THE STUFF DOESN'T.

00:09:14.712 --> 00:09:18.048
IT USED TO -- HE USED TO BE

00:09:18.049 --> 00:09:19.683
VIEWED AS A SOCIAL JUSTICE

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:20.183
WARRIOR.

00:09:20.184 --> 00:09:21.451
&gt;&gt; Greg: I REMEMBER.

00:09:21.452 --> 00:09:23.153
WE HAVE ASKED HIM HERE.

00:09:23.154 --> 00:09:24.254
&gt;&gt; Jedediah: LIBERALS LOVED

00:09:24.255 --> 00:09:24.688
HIM.

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:26.657
NOW THEY HAVE TO MAKE IT THEIR

00:09:26.658 --> 00:09:28.992
JOB TO DESTROY HIM AND DESTROY

00:09:28.993 --> 00:09:29.426
THAT COMPANY.

00:09:29.427 --> 00:09:31.495
&gt;&gt; Greg: TO YOUR POINT, THE

00:09:31.496 --> 00:09:32.362
MEDIA AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

00:09:32.363 --> 00:09:34.264
ARE GOING TO NARROW THE FOCUS TO

00:09:34.265 --> 00:09:36.700
THE PERSON THEY WANT, WHICH IS

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:37.034
KAMALA.

00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:38.101
&gt;&gt; Jedediah: THIS IS WHAT THEY

00:09:38.102 --> 00:09:38.368
DO.

00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:40.103
THEY MIGHT LIKE YOU BEFORE AND

00:09:40.104 --> 00:09:40.804
THEN WHEN THEY SENSE THAT YOU

00:09:40.805 --> 00:09:43.106
ARE A THREAT TO FAR LEFT

00:09:43.107 --> 00:09:44.107
POLICIES, THIS GUY IS GOING TO

00:09:44.108 --> 00:09:45.475
HAVE TO BE DESTROYED.

00:09:45.476 --> 00:09:47.310
&gt;&gt; Jesse: WHEN A DEMOCRAT

00:09:47.311 --> 00:09:48.545
TELLS OTHER DEMOCRATS YOU'RE

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:49.680
GOING CRAZY COMING OR GOING OUT

00:09:49.681 --> 00:09:50.981
TO DEFEND, THAT REALLY HURTS.

00:09:50.982 --> 00:09:52.482
IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE A DRINKING

00:09:52.483 --> 00:09:53.884
PROBLEM AND PEOPLE TELL YOU TO

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:54.551
STOP DRINKING.

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:55.519
YOU DON'T LISTEN.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.090
THEN WHEN YOUR FRIEND TELLS YOU
