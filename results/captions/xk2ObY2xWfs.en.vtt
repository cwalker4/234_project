00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:26.126
&gt;&gt; OH, THEY'RE GREAT.

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:29.496

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:49.149
THIS BOOK IS KIZMET AS MY PEOPLE
WOULD SAY.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.750
HOW'S YOUR FRIEND DONALD TRUMP?

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.684
&gt;&gt; GETTING WORSE EVERY DAY.

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:55.021
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THE BUZZ IS YOU
GUYS CAN TALK A LANGUAGE THAT HE

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:56.656
CAN UNDERSTAND, THAT HE LIKES.

00:00:56.656 --> 00:01:02.996 align:end position:100%
YOU ACTUALLY SAID OFF MIC ON
C-SPAN, HE LIKES ME ANYWAY, IT'S

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:05.165 size:81% position:41%
GOING TO WORK OUT.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.000
&gt;&gt; ONE OF MY WRONG PREDICTIONS.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.401 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THIS WAS A LONG
TIME AGO.

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:09.769
&gt;&gt; THIS WAS A WHILE AGO.

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:12.906
HE WOULD START OUT BY FLATTERING
ME.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.608
THAT DIDN'T WORK, SO HE TRIED TO
CALL ME NAMES.

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:16.409 align:start size:88% position:13%
NEITHER WORKS.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.178
WE STICK BY OUR VALUES.

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:21.981
THEY'RE VERY FAR AWAY FROM WHERE
DONALD TRUMP'S VALUES ARE AND

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:26.286
FRANKLY FROM WHERE MOST OF
AMERICA'S VALUES ARE AND WE'RE

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:37.630
STANDING STRONG AND WE'RE THE
CHECK ON DONALD TRUMP.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.501
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:46.673
HISTORIANS WILL CALL S-HOLE-GATE
FROM LAST THURSDAY.

( LAUGHTER )
A LITTLE WHILE AGO, THIS

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:51.811
AFTERNOON, HE TWEETED SENATOR
DICKEY DURBIN TOTALLY

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.481
MISREPRESENTED WHAT I SAID AT
THE DACA MEETING.

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:58.118
DO YOU HAVE ANY DOUBTS THAT
SENATOR DURBIN IS TELLING THE

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:03.623
TRUTH WHEN HE SAYS THAT THE
PRESIDENT SAID REPEATEDLY WHY DO

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:06.192 align:start size:88% position:13%
WE NEED PEOPLE FROM --
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO DOUBT.

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:09.028
FIRST, DONALD TRUMP HAS LIED SO
MANY TIMES IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:13.466
HIM ON ANYTHING LET ALONE THIS,
BUT SECOND, I'VE KNOWN DICK

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:14.434 size:88% position:44%
DURBIN FOR 35 YEARS.

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:16.569
HE WAS MY ROOMMATE FOR 20 YEARS.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.438
WE SHARED A LITTLE ROW HOUSE.

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:22.976
HE'S ONE OF THE MOST HONORABLE
PEOPLE I'VE EVER MET.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.278
I NEVER HAVE KNOWN HIM TO LIE.

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:30.483
I TOTALLY BELIEVE DICK DURBIN
AND I THINK MOST AMERICANS DO,

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:30.650 align:start size:88% position:13%
TOO.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.518 align:start size:88% position:13%
( APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: MANY PEOPLE LOOK

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:34.020
AT THIS THE AND WHAT THE
PRESIDENT HAS SAID AND JUST

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.756
SAID, OKAY, WELL, DONALD TRUMP
IS A RACIST.

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:39.559
DO YOU THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP
IS A RACIST?

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:43.029
&gt;&gt; LOOK, HIS COMMENTS OVER AND
OVER AND OVER AGAIN CAN BE

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:46.699
DESCRIBED AS NOTHING BUT RACIST
AND OBNOXIOUS.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.235
HE SAYS HE'S NOT A RACIST.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:51.437 align:start size:88% position:13%
WELL --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HE'S THE LEAST

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:53.806
RACIST PERSON --
&gt;&gt; THE LEAST RACIST PERSON YOU

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:54.741 size:88% position:44%
WOULD EVER SPEAK TO.

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:56.075
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OF ALL TIME.

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:59.879
O I HAVE A CHALLENGE FOR
DONALD TRUMP, OKAY, ACTIONS

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.581
SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS.

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:05.685
IF YOU WANT TO JUST BEGIN THE
LONG ROAD BACK TO PROVING YOU'RE

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:11.991
NOT RACIST OR BIGOTED, SUPPORT
THE BIPARTISAN COMPROMISE THREE

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:16.095
DEMOCRATS AND THREE REPUBLICANS
PUT ON THE FLOOR, EVERYONE GAVE,

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:19.766
AND GET THE DREAMERS SAFETY HERE
IN AMERICA.

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:21.367
THAT'S WHAT HE SHOULD DO.

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:26.906
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND LET ME SAY THIS, STEPHEN --

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:30.443
THAT BILL -- DONALD TRUMP AT ONE
POINT SAID, WELL, THERE ARE

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:32.045
THREE AREAS OF CONTENTION.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:36.449
THE THREE OF THEM, THE SIX OF
THEM, TRIED TO GO SOMEWHAT IN

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.886
HIS DIRECTION ON THOSE THREE
AREAS IN RETURN FOR DREAMERS.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:44.557 align:end position:100%
IF THIS BILL DOESN'T BECOME LAW,
THERE WILL ONLY BE ONE THING

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:48.194
STANDING IN HIS WAY AND THAT'S
DONALD TRUMP AND HIS

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:48.528 align:start size:88% position:13%
INTRANSIGENCE.

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:51.664
IF IT WAS PUT ON THE FLOOR IN
THE HOUSE OR THE SENATE IT WOULD

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:54.267
GET A MAJORITY VOTE IN EITHER
ONE.

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:58.037
&gt;&gt; Stephen: DO YOU THINK THOSE
ARE HIS INTRANSIGENCE OR DO YOU

00:03:58.037 --> 00:04:02.442
THINK HE'S JUST BEING PRESSURED
BY THE FARTHEST RIGHT ON

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:04.410
IMMIGRATION POLICY IN HIS OWN
PARTY?

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.549
&gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE GOING TO LISTEN TO
THE FARTHEST RIGHT, WE WILL NOT

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.618
HAVE AN IMMIGRATION PARTY.

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:15.755
YOU CAN'T GET A SMALL GROUP ON
THE EXTREME GOVERN, IT'S A

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:16.189 size:88% position:44%
FORMULA FOR FAILURE.

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:21.527
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT'S HE LIKE TO
NEGOTIATE WITH?

00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:21.728 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; OH!

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:23.229 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BECAUSE YOU HAVE

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.898
BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH HIM FOR
MONTHS.

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:26.132 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:28.968 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU'VE KNOWN HIM
FROM BACK IN NEW YORK.

00:04:28.968 --> 00:04:29.202 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:33.973 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HE'S SUPPOSED TO
BE AN EXPERT NEGOTIATE.

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:34.774 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; OH --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ART OF THE DEAL,

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:35.675 align:start size:88% position:13%
MY FRIEND.

00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:39.045 align:start size:88% position:13%
DO YOU SEE THE ART IN HIS
DEALMAKING?

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:41.914
&gt;&gt; THE ART OF FAILURE IN ABOUT
EVERY DEAL HE MAKES.

00:04:41.914 --> 00:04:45.118
HE HAS TWO WAYS OF NEGOTIATING.

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:49.222
ONE, HE'LL SHAKE YOUR HAND AND
THE NEXT DAY TOTALLY BACK OFF.

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:53.426
NANCY PELOSI AT THE WHITE HOUSE
AND I HAD AN AGREEMENT WITH HIM

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:55.061
ON DREAMERS FOR BORDER SECURITY.

00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:56.029 align:start size:88% position:13%
HE AGREED.

00:04:56.029 --> 00:05:00.867
THE NEXT DAY GOT PRESSURE FROM
THE HARD RIGHT AND BACKED OFF.

00:05:00.867 --> 00:05:03.269 align:start size:88% position:13%
THAT'S WHAT HE DOES OVER AND
OVER AGAIN.

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:06.906
THE OTHER WAY IS SAYING "HERE'S
HOW I WANT IT, YOU DO IT MY WAY

00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:08.274 align:start size:88% position:13%
OR ELSE."

00:05:08.274 --> 00:05:13.046
HE WASN'T A GOOD NEGOTIATE IN
REAL ESTATE DEALS IN NEW YORK

00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:16.716
AND ONE OF THE MANY REASONS HIS
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN A

00:05:16.716 --> 00:05:20.386
FAILURE SO FAR IS HE'S A POOR
NEGOTIATOR BECAUSE HE USES ONLY

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:21.788
ONE OF THOSE TWO TACTICS.

00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:26.392 align:end position:100%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THE WORD IS WHEN
YOU AND NANCY PELOSI MET HIM IS

00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:30.163 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU PLAYED ON HIS LOVE OF
NEW YORK AND GOT ON HIS GOOD

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:30.363 align:start size:88% position:13%
SIDE.

00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:34.600
WE ACTUALLY MANAGED TO GET A
CAMERA INTO THAT MEETING WITH

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:41.808
OUR FRIENDS FROM SHOWTIME FROM
OUR SHOW COMING UP IN TWO WEEKS,

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:45.645
WE HAVE A CLIP OF OUR CAMERAS
CATCHING THE THREE OF YOU

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:46.079 align:start size:88% position:13%
NEGOTIATING.

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:46.379 align:start size:88% position:13%
JIM?

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.549
&gt;&gt; JUST KNOW YOU CAN'T SOFTEN ME
UP WITH A BUNCH OF NEW YORK

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:49.782 align:start size:88% position:13%
TALK.

00:05:49.782 --> 00:05:51.684
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE NOT, MR. PRESIDENT.

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:53.720
WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT --
NEW YORK.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.554 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT IT?

00:05:54.554 --> 00:06:01.527 align:start size:88% position:13%
I WAS TAKING THE STATEN
ISLAND FERRY THE OTHER DAY.

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:02.729

00:06:10.937 --> 00:06:11.571
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ACCURATE?

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:14.407 align:start size:88% position:13%
ON THE MONEY.

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:16.476
LEFT OUT ONE THING, BROOKLYN!

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:18.745
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I TOTALLY GET IT.

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:23.349
NOW, LET ME ASK YOU, THERE'S A
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SUBJECT BUT

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:25.051 align:start size:88% position:13%
HAS TO DO WITH THE CHANGING
SENATE.

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:27.754
DO YOU FEEL LIKE THE DEMOCRATS
WILL TAKE THE SENATE?

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:27.987 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:30.590
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ARE YOU CONFIDENT
THEY WILL TAKE IT BACK?

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.160
&gt;&gt; WE'RE WORKING REAL HARD AT IT
AND I THINK THE ODDS ARE GREATER

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.463
THAN HALF WE'LL TAKE BACK THE
SENATE, ABSOLUTELY.

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:42.902 align:start size:88% position:13%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND THE HOUSE --

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:47.206 align:start size:88% position:13%
I THINK THE HOUSE ODDS ARE
VERY GOOD, TOO.

00:06:47.206 --> 00:06:48.174 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: MM-HMM.

00:06:48.174 --> 00:06:51.744
IN PART, WE HAVE A REAL
FRIEND IN TAKING BACK THE HOUSE

00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:52.578
AND SENATE, DONALD TRUMP.

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:55.515
&gt;&gt; Stephen: RIGHT, BUT DO YOU
THINK PEOPLE WILL THEN BE VOTING

00:06:55.515 --> 00:06:58.751
FOR DEMOCRATS OR AGAINST DONALD
TRUMP?

00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:02.088 align:start size:88% position:13%
AND I MEAN THIS SINCERELY --
&gt;&gt; YES, YOU DO.

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:04.924
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THIS YEAR WHAT
DOES THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY STAND

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:05.491 align:start size:88% position:13%
FOR?

00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:07.894
&gt;&gt; SO, LOOK, WE HAVE TO BE A
STRONG CHECK AGAINST TRUMP BUT

00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:08.594
THAT'S NOT SUFFICIENT.

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:12.265
WE HAVE TO SHOW AVERAGE FOLKS
WE'RE ON THEIR SIDE WHILE TRUMP

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:14.534
IS ON THE SIDE OF THE WEALTHY
AND POWERFUL INTERESTS.

00:07:14.534 --> 00:07:17.804
IF WE DO BOTH, WE'LL TAKE BACK
THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE.

00:07:17.804 --> 00:07:21.073
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELL, YOU LOST ONE
OF THE STARS OF THE DEMOCRATIC

00:07:21.073 --> 00:07:24.577
PARTY THIS YEAR, ONE OF THE
BIGGEST FUNDRAISERS OF THE

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:26.045
DEMOCRATS IN AL FRANKEN.

00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:26.279 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.982
&gt;&gt; Stephen: LOOKING BACK ON
HOW THAT WAS HANDLED, THAT

00:07:29.982 --> 00:07:32.885 size:88% position:56%
FRANKEN WAS ASKED TO RESIGN
AGAINST HIS WILL, AS YOU CAN

00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:35.888
TELL FROM THE SPEECH HE GAVE,
BEFORE THE ETHICS INVESTIGATION

00:07:35.888 --> 00:07:36.589 align:start size:88% position:13%
WAS OVER.

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:38.291
DO YOU FEEL THAT WAS THE RIGHT
THING TO DO?

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:43.963 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; WELL, LOOK, I AM A STRONG
BELIEVER IN #METOO.

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:47.733
WOMEN HAVE BEEN ABUSED, TAKEN
ADVANTAGE OF IN SO MANY

00:07:47.733 --> 00:07:53.606
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT I THINK THAT
A STRONG STAND IN THAT REGARD IS

00:07:53.606 --> 00:07:54.407 align:start size:88% position:13%
VERY IMPORTANT.

00:07:54.407 --> 00:08:00.313
YOU CAN LOOK AT EACH INDIVIDUAL
CASE, AS YOU SHOULD, AND PEOPLE
