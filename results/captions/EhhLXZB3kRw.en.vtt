00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.180
Buying plane tickets can be exhausting.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.700
Many of us spend hours on the
internet researching flight deals,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.700
trying to figure out an airfare
pricing system that seems random.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.640
Fees appear to fluctuate without reason, and longer
flights aren’t always more expensive than shorter ones.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.020
But behind this is actually the
science of dynamic pricing,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.820
which has less to do with cost and
more to do with artificial intelligence.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.040
It’s been more than a hundred years
since the first scheduled flight.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:38.380
The Comet, scheduled by British Overseas Airways
Corp., to start the world's first jet passenger air service.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.460
In the beginning, commercial aviation
was a tightly regulated market place,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.020
where airfares were based on distance
traveled rather than passenger demand.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.520
Most international routes were
operated by a single national carrier

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.560
and the lack of choice resulted in
uncompetitive fares for consumers.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.080
Deregulation, however, changed all that.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.160
In 1978, the U.S. government began the
process of removing government controls

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.100
over routes and market
entry for new airlines.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.320
In 1983, fares followed.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.920
And by the early 1990s, the
liberalization of the aviation industry

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.740
had spread around the world,
making pricing more competitive.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.480
Critics also say there was too much competition
in the first years after deregulation.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.100
Airlines merged and became more
dominant, changing the industry

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.860
from a regulated cartel into
an unregulated cartel.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.520
In the U.S., just four airlines control
68% of the domestic airline capacity.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.820
While ticket prices have been falling
between major hub airports,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.440
the lack of competition
and a reduction in flights

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.880
has resulted in higher average airfare
for smaller, less competitive cities.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.420
But this hasn’t halted the
demand in air travel.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.900
The number of airline passengers across the globe has
continued to grow, particularly in the last ten years,

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.060
with the amount of people choosing to
fly skyrocketing by nearly 1.8 billion.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.120
So what does this increasing volume of
passengers mean for pricing tickets?

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.460
Despite steep surcharges and baggage
fees tacked on during the 2007-2008 oil shock,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.620
ticket prices aren't actually focused on the
seats' combined cost such as taxes and fuel.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.460
Instead airlines price tickets using a strategy
called airline revenue management.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.220
Its end goal? Make as
much money as possible.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.100
This is working in real time.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.600
So when a customer goes to book a seat,
the airlines determines the price they see

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.920
by analyzing a wide range of factors
including the status of their entire network.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.040
Of course, these decisions
aren’t being made by humans.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.160
Algorithms adjust fares by using information
like past bookings, remaining capacity,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.920
average demand for certain routes and
the probability of selling more seats later.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.900
One example of this process being
used is for pricing connecting routes.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.300
Let’s say you want to fly London to Miami.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.060
The flight you want to book also serves as
the first leg of a connected flight to Bogota.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.540
While you’re traveling less distance to
Miami, you may end up paying more

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.960
than passengers flying
through to Bogota.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.460
That’s because airlines are trying to
discourage you from buying seats

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.420
that they want to keep
available for the full journey.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.221
This entire thought process
is done by the algorithm,

00:03:11.221 --> 00:03:14.880
which predicts those seats will
sell for a higher price in the future.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.060
Airlines also profile their customers
to help them adjust prices.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.160
This often means placing passengers into
one of two groups: leisure or business.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.740
And the way each group
is priced is very different.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.920
An airline offering a flight from London to
Bali can assume that the people on that route

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.120
are largely holidaymakers, so it
places them in the leisure bracket.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.920
These passengers usually
book months in advance,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.720
so airlines tend to start the price
for these seats relatively high.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.680
It then adjusts the price according to market response,
making sure it's high enough to maximize profit,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.900
but low enough so that it doesn’t
result in unused capacity.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.000
While on a typical business route,
such as London to Hong Kong,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.780
airlines usually start with low
prices to fill a minimum capacity.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.960
Then it increases prices steeply for
business travelers who book last minute.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.300
That’s because airlines know
business travelers tend to book later

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.660
and are far less price sensitive
than their leisure counterparts.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.720
In fact, business travelers are willing to
pay 60% more on average to secure a seat.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.020
Some analysts believe airlines use
consumer’s internet browser cookies

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.920
to determine what flights
they’ve been looking at.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.940
This way, they can increase those
prices to encourage them to buy.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.680
But solid proof of this
practice is hard to come by,

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.460
and it’s something airlines and price
comparison sites strongly deny.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.680
Targeted dynamic prices however
can increase customer satisfaction

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.860
and encourage consumer bookings.
For example, a member of an airline loyalty

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.860
program could receive ‘just for you’ price displays
based on their purchasing history.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.700
Technology has also allowed some
airlines to create a ‘basic economy fare’

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.180
with limited amenities to compete
with minimal service, low cost carriers.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.800
That lower fare is key if full service
carriers want to appear on the first page

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.960
of search engines like Google Flights.
But it’s not just airlines that are using

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.940
AI technology to their advantage.
Consumers now have access

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.880
to sites which monitor fares, using
their own algorithms and past data,

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.860
to predict the lowest price a seat will
reach to then alert their customers.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.420
The threat airfare search sites pose to airlines’
dynamic pricing system even saw United Airlines

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.480
suing the website Skiplagged, which helps
passengers find loopholes for cheaper tickets.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.500
With AI having such an important role
in the field of air travel pricing,

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.970
it’s likely that complex algorithms
will continue to fight the airfare war.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.300
That may not be a bad thing, as airlines
manage a growing number of passengers

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.300
and consumers push for better choices
and easier ways to book their trips.
