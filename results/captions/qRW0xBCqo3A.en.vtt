00:00:01.002 --> 00:00:02.769
ANTI-SEMITES WILL LOSE THE

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.272
PRESIDENCY IN 2020.

00:00:05.273 --> 00:00:07.908
JOINING ME WITH REACTION TO MY

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:09.877
OPENING STATEMENT AND MUCH

00:00:09.878 --> 00:00:12.379
MORE, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.647
KEVIN McCARTHY.

00:00:13.648 --> 00:00:16.650
I UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN YOU

00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:18.519
YOURSELF WERE INVOLVED A BIT IN

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.726
SOME OF THESE TROPES AND ILHAN

00:00:25.727 --> 00:00:27.094
OMAR CAME AFTER YOU.

00:00:27.095 --> 00:00:29.330
&gt;&gt; WHEN SHE TWEETED ABOUT ALL

00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:30.998
ABOUT THE BENJAMINS.

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.033
THAT WAS REFERRING TO AN ARTICLE

00:00:33.034 --> 00:00:35.936
A REPORTER WROTE THAT I WAS

00:00:35.937 --> 00:00:39.039
ASKING NANCY PELOSI TO STAND UP

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.942
TO THE NEW DEMOCRAT SOCIALISTS

00:00:40.943 --> 00:00:44.312
WHO ARE MAKING THESE

00:00:44.313 --> 00:00:45.046
ANTI-SEMITIC COMMENTS.

00:00:45.047 --> 00:00:48.015
THIS IS THE WEEK THE NEW

00:00:48.016 --> 00:00:49.617
DEMOCRAT SOCIALISTS HAVE TAKEN

00:00:49.618 --> 00:00:51.085
OVER THE PARTY.

00:00:51.086 --> 00:00:52.587
BECAUSE THEY WON THIS WEEK.

00:00:52.588 --> 00:00:54.255
NANCY PELOSI SAID SHE WAS GOING

00:00:54.256 --> 00:00:56.357
TO STAND UP TO HER AND MOVE A

00:00:56.358 --> 00:00:57.692
RESOLUTION THAT JUST DEALT WITH

00:00:57.693 --> 00:00:58.693
THIS SUBJECT.

00:00:58.694 --> 00:01:00.395
IT WOULDN'T NAME HER AND SHE

00:01:00.396 --> 00:01:01.629
COULDN'T EVEN PASS THAT.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.898
SHE HAD TO WATER IT DOWN.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.800
THEY NOW OWN THE DEMOCRATIC

00:01:05.801 --> 00:01:08.469
PARTY WHICH IS NOW THE DEMOCRAT

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.470
SOCIALIST PARTY.

00:01:09.471 --> 00:01:13.875
WHEN YOU APPEASE, HIT HAS TAUGHT

00:01:13.876 --> 00:01:17.011
US, THERE -- HISTORY HAS TAUGHT

00:01:17.012 --> 00:01:17.745
US.

00:01:17.746 --> 00:01:21.549
THERE IS A RISE OF

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.983
ANTI-SEMITISM.

00:01:21.984 --> 00:01:24.252
OMAR REPEATED IT I BELIEVE EVEN

00:01:24.253 --> 00:01:25.887
WORSE, QUESTIONING THE

00:01:25.888 --> 00:01:27.622
ALLEGIANCE AND ALLIANCE OF

00:01:27.623 --> 00:01:28.423
AMERICAN JEWS.

00:01:28.424 --> 00:01:30.792
COULD THEY BE TRUE TO AMERICA?

00:01:30.793 --> 00:01:33.094
WE HEARD THESE QUESTIONS ASKED

00:01:33.095 --> 00:01:34.228
HISTORY IN THE PAST?

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.630
WHAT DID HISTORY SAY?

00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:38.233
WE CAN NEVER ALLOW THAT TO

00:01:38.234 --> 00:01:39.133
REPEAT ITSELF.

00:01:39.134 --> 00:01:41.970
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT.

00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:44.405
NOT ONE PARTY.

00:01:44.406 --> 00:01:46.574
JUDGE JEANINE: I UNDERSTAND

00:01:46.575 --> 00:01:47.909
NANCY PELOSI HAS BEEN THE

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.578
SPEAKER TWICE, AND AS A WOMAN,

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.015
SHE IS PROBABLY IN TERMS OF

00:01:54.016 --> 00:01:55.650
WOMEN IN CONGRESS, SHE IS THE

00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:58.853
MOST OF POWERFUL WOMAN IN

00:01:58.854 --> 00:01:59.220
CONGRESS.

00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:01.022
&gt;&gt; BY FAR.

00:02:01.023 --> 00:02:02.891
NOT THIS WEEK.

00:02:02.892 --> 00:02:04.526
JUDGE JEANINE: DIDN'T HER

00:02:04.527 --> 00:02:06.661
DAUGHTER SAY SHE'LL STAB YOU IN

00:02:06.662 --> 00:02:07.896
THE BACK AND CUT YOU AND YOU

00:02:07.897 --> 00:02:09.397
WON'T EVEN KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN

00:02:09.398 --> 00:02:10.165
CUT.

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:11.566
WHY DID SHE BEND?

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:12.534
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:02:12.535 --> 00:02:15.103
IS SHE WORRIED THESE YOUNG WOMEN

00:02:15.104 --> 00:02:16.838
ARE GOING TO TAKE OVER?

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:18.740
IS SHE WATCHING THE ATTENTION

00:02:18.741 --> 00:02:20.108
THEY ARE GETTING AND IS

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:22.477
CONCERNED ABOUT HER OWN FUTURE?

00:02:22.478 --> 00:02:24.913
&gt;&gt; REMEMBER WHAT TOOK PLACE.

00:02:24.914 --> 00:02:26.381
SHE WAS ON THE COVER OF THE

00:02:26.382 --> 00:02:28.550
ROLLING STONES WITH THE YOUNG

00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:31.620
NEW CONGRESS WOMEN WHO CALL

00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:33.755
THEMSELVES DEMOCRAT SOCIALISTS.

00:02:33.756 --> 00:02:35.023
THAT'S NOT WHAT I THINK.

00:02:35.024 --> 00:02:36.992
THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL

00:02:36.993 --> 00:02:37.492
THEMSELVES.

00:02:37.493 --> 00:02:43.098
THEN YOU HEARD THE COMMENTS

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.500
CONGRESSWOMAN OMAR SAID.

00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:47.703
LAST TIME WAS THE REPUBLICAN

00:02:47.704 --> 00:02:49.237
PARTY WHO STOOD UP AND BROUGHT

00:02:49.238 --> 00:02:50.105
IT TO THE FLOOR.

00:02:50.106 --> 00:02:52.074
BUT THEY HAD TO BACKTRACK.

00:02:52.075 --> 00:02:54.676
WE KNOW SPEAKER PELOSI AS A

00:02:54.677 --> 00:02:55.677
STRONG WOMAN.

00:02:55.678 --> 00:02:57.846
BUT SHE LOST THIS WEEK.

00:02:57.847 --> 00:03:00.048
SHE HAD TO BACK PEDESTRIANING

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.451
AND

00:03:02.452 --> 00:03:05.087
PEDESTRIANO --SHE HAD TO BACK PD

00:03:05.088 --> 00:03:05.120
PEDESTRIANO --SHE HAD TO BACK PL

00:03:05.121 --> 00:03:05.154
PEDESTRIANO --SHE HAD TO BACK PE

00:03:05.155 --> 00:03:05.187
PEDESTRIANO --SHE HAD TO BACK PA

00:03:05.188 --> 00:03:05.254
PEDESTRIANO --SHE HAD TO BACK PD

00:03:05.255 --> 00:03:05.687
PEDESTRIANO --SHE HAD TO BACK PI

00:03:05.688 --> 00:03:05.721
PEDESTRIANO --SHE HAD TO BACK PS

00:03:05.722 --> 00:03:06.221
PEDESTRIANO --SHE HAD TO BACK PE

00:03:06.222 --> 00:03:09.458
COULDN'T BRING IT TO THE FLOOR.

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.629
YOU HAD THE NEW PROGRESSIVES.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.863
JUDGE JEANINE: THREE WOMEN ARE

00:03:14.864 --> 00:03:16.765
GOING TO SCARE NANCY PELOSI?

00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:17.499
&gt;&gt; THEY DID.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.902
I THINK THAT'S THE NEW MOVEMENT

00:03:19.903 --> 00:03:21.904
IN THE DEMOCRAT SOCIALIST PARTY,

00:03:21.905 --> 00:03:24.306
THEY HAVE OVERTAKEN THIS

00:03:24.307 --> 00:03:24.773
LEADERSHIP.

00:03:24.774 --> 00:03:28.710
THIS IS THE MARK OF THE DATE OF

00:03:28.711 --> 00:03:30.913
THE WEEK WHERE THEY HAVE

00:03:30.914 --> 00:03:36.418
OVERTAKEN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:37.719
JUDGE JEANINE: BERNIE SANDERS

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.621
SAID WAY SEE GOING ON IN THE

00:03:39.622 --> 00:03:41.690
HOUSE IS A WAY OF STIFLING

00:03:41.691 --> 00:03:42.558
DEBATE.

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:46.161
TALK ABOUT TUSHING THE AGGRESSOR

00:03:46.162 --> 00:03:48.363
IN -- TALK ABOUT TURNING THE

00:03:48.364 --> 00:03:49.898
AGGRESSOR INTO THE VICTIM.

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:53.235
NOW SHE IS TAKING A VICTORY LAP

00:03:53.236 --> 00:03:54.570
AND SHE'LL DOUBLE DOWN AGAIN.

00:03:54.571 --> 00:03:57.172
&gt;&gt; THE FIRST TIME SHE WENT

00:03:57.173 --> 00:03:58.774
FORWARD THE DEMOCRATS SAID SHE

00:03:58.775 --> 00:04:00.342
NEEDS TO APOLOGIZE.

00:04:00.343 --> 00:04:02.344
THIS TIME SHE REPEATS EIGHT AND

00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:05.881
THEY DON'T EVEN SAY -- REPEATS

00:04:05.882 --> 00:04:08.083
IT AND THEY DON'T EVEN SAY SHE

00:04:08.084 --> 00:04:13.622
HAS TO APOLOGIZE.

00:04:13.623 --> 00:04:16.892
WHEN SOMEBODY STOOD UP THE

00:04:16.893 --> 00:04:18.761
REPUBLICANS REMOVED HIM FROM

00:04:18.762 --> 00:04:19.194
COMMITTEE.

00:04:19.195 --> 00:04:22.364
BUT WHAT IS SCARY TO ME AS AN

00:04:22.365 --> 00:04:25.801
AMERICAN, WHEN I SEAT RISE OF

00:04:25.802 --> 00:04:27.269
ANTI-SEMITISM AROUND THE WORLD,

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.340
AND I HE APPEASEMENT AND I SEE

00:04:31.341 --> 00:04:35.778

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:37.613
APPEASEMENT.

00:04:37.614 --> 00:04:39.916
JUDGE JEANINE: THEY BETTER
