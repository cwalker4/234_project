WHAT HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS GETTING
HIMSELF INTO.

HE WAS A BRILLIANT MAN.

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:36.082 size:75% position:38%
THE MOVIE EXPLORES THAT.

00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:40.486 align:start position:0%
HE JUST SORT OF GOT WRAPPED UP
IN THE FAME OF IT ALL.

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.622 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND WHAT'S THE

WHAT IS "MY DINNER WITH HERVEÉ."

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:49.061 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; MY FRIEND WHO WROTE AND
DIRECTED THE FILM, HE

COMMITTED SUICIDE.

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:58.504 align:start position:0%
AND HE REALIZED IT WAS JUST LOOK
A PUFF PIECE.

HE WAS A BRITISH JOURNALIST, AND
IT WAS A PUFF PIECE THAT HE WAS

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:04.744 align:start position:0%
SORT OF TOLD TO GO TO LOS

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:10.816
AND OVER THE COURSE OF THREE
NIGHTS, HE SORT OF REVEALED HIS

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.653 align:start position:0%
WHOLE LIFE STORY TO HIM, AND
ONLY LATER DID HE REALIZE IT WAS

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:15.154 align:start position:0%

NOTHING TO GO BACK TO.

00:04:40.846 --> 00:04:42.181 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:04:42.214 --> 00:04:43.449 align:start position:0%
IT WAS GOD.

00:04:43.482 --> 00:04:45.851 align:start position:0%
GOD IS THE ONE THAT KEPT ME
GOING.

00:04:45.884 --> 00:04:47.420
&gt;&gt; YOU SERIOUSLY BELIEVE IN GOD?

&gt;&gt; YES.

00:04:49.621 --> 00:04:52.525 align:start position:0%

DID.

00:05:02.234 --> 00:05:05.037 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY KNOW
THAT.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:12.211 align:start position:0%
