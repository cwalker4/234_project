00:00:04.495 --> 00:00:07.270
Venezuelan protesters
throw rocks at forces loyal

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.960
to President Nicolás Maduro.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.970
We’re on the Colombian side
of the border with Venezuela.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.150
We came here to see if the
fight to push across U.S. aid

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.820
will break Maduro’s
hold on power.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.710
But so far, the confrontation
has led to this:

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.340
tear gas, hundreds
of injuries,

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.070
and the trucks with the aid
eventually turning back.

00:00:42.131 --> 00:00:44.380
It was a very different scene
along the border

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.450
the day before.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.670
This bridge has been
barricaded by Maduro

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.910
to keep our donated food
and medical supplies, which

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.278
he sees as a ploy to
undermine his government.

00:00:54.278 --> 00:00:56.356
[music]

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:58.230
On this day, the bridge
turned into the stage

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.181
for a star-studded concert

00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:03.548
[singing]

00:01:08.165 --> 00:01:10.210
energizing Venezuelans
with pop music

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.413
and rallying support
for the opposition.

00:01:16.357 --> 00:01:17.840
[cheering]

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.010
At times, it felt removed from
the reality inside Venezuela

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.670
and we wondered if
a show like this

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.210
could really play any part
in bringing political change.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.280
We spoke with billionaire
Richard Branson, one

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.110
of the event’s organizers.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.595
We film from up here.

00:01:31.595 --> 00:01:33.162
We’re both in sweaty t-shirts.

00:01:33.162 --> 00:01:35.120
“We’re going to have a
wonderful concert today.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.017
Hopefully, it’ll be
a dawn of a new era.”

00:01:37.017 --> 00:01:37.850
Do you believe that?

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.420
Do you believe
that it can be —

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.250
that can be achieved?

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.440
“I’m really hopeful.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.590
I think anybody who’s
in a position to help

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.580
should help.”

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.390
Is this just a
media spectacle?

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.940
“Go and talk to the
people in the audience,

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.360
who are predominantly
Venezuelans,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.925
and you’ll realize that
it’s anything but that.”

00:01:59.925 --> 00:02:02.835
[music]

00:02:26.944 --> 00:02:28.590
[music]

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.896
“Imagine
there’s no country.

00:02:34.848 --> 00:02:37.812
It isn’t hard to do.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.847
Nothing to kill or die for — “

00:02:44.847 --> 00:02:46.180
It’s the day that
the opposition

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.290
will try to force the
aid across the border.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.186
And we’re back where the
concert ended hours before.

00:02:52.186 --> 00:02:53.410
[truck horn honking]

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.230
Juan Guaidó, the leader of
the opposition, arrives.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.540
He’s been recognized as
Venezuela’s president

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.795
by more than 50 countries,
including the United States.

00:03:05.795 --> 00:03:07.920
Everyone on the bridge is
watching to see what will

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.680
happen when Guaidó tries
to lead the trucks carrying

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.960
across the aid.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.690
But the border is sealed.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.350
On the other side, the
Venezuelan armed forces,

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.766
essential to Maduro’s
power, do not budge.

00:03:23.766 --> 00:03:25.890
And Guaidó’s hope that they
would step aside to let

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.045
the aid through is dashed.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.610
Guaidó and the trucks never
make it onto the bridge,

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.680
nor do these Venezuelans.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.300
Colombian police keep them
back to prevent clashes.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.930
But on other bridges,
violence does break out.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.440
We tag along with Omar
Lares, a former mayor

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.092
living in exile for opposing
Maduro’s government.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.330
We see one of the
trucks with aid burning

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.270
after protesters clashed with
Venezuelan security forces.

00:04:09.965 --> 00:04:11.960
At the end of the day,
a couple of dozen soldiers

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.030
had defected.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.800
But Maduro survived
the challenge.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.620
Guaidó is outside his country,

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.889
and it’s unclear when
he’ll be able to return.

00:04:26.882 --> 00:04:29.090
Now the stage is set for
what could become a bloodier

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.310
conflict, as
Venezuela’s presidents

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.960
dig in their heels.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.282
