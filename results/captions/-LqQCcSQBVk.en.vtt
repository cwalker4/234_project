00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
and I know I'm opening myself up to
getting hundreds of very very passionate

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.750
comments telling me that I'm very stupid
for this hey guys what's up it's Kelly

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.250
again and welcome back to my channel a
few weeks ago I talked to you guys about

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.810
some weird habits that my German
boyfriend has and now it is my turn to

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.779
talk about my weird American habits that
drive Misha crazy and the first one is

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.250
eating and drinking on the go I don't
know if it's just because Americans have

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.300
a more rushed lifestyle or we have
longer commutes or we're constantly

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.540
doing long road trips but Americans are
always eating and drinking on the go and

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.719
I didn't even realize that this was a
weird habit in other countries until I

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.920
started dating Misha and we were
traveling around Germany together to go

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.739
see different cities and on our several
hour drive I would stop at like a gas

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.760
station coffee shop on the side of the
Autobahn to grab some coffee with the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.750
intent of bringing it back into the car
or sipping it while driving somewhere

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.560
and Misha would always order for us and
for the first couple trips I didn't

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.700
think to tell him to get the coffee to
go because I thought it was normal and

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.020
therefore just assumed but as it turns
out it's not normal and therefore it's

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.020
not assumed and so Misha was always
getting the coffee to drink there at the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.479
gas station coffee shop instead of to go
and this was just insane to me because I

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.200
was like man I just want to get where
we're going like I just want to drink

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.479
the coffee in the car but it was equally
insane to him to take the coffee into

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.070
the car because he would never eat or
drink in his car and also he looks at

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.659
drinking coffee and going out to eat as
like a very social thing and so because

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.720
of that there's more formalities
involved for him it's a bit more

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.560
structured than what like I'm
accustomed to and we go back and forth

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.939
on this sometimes I win and we get the
coffee to go and sometimes Misha wins

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.049
and we will say and drink the coffee
instead and actually I didn't think

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.719
about this until I started talking what
like this really is a difference between

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.170
the US and Germany because I feel like
in the u.s. when you go to a coffee shop

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.310
and you order coffee
it is either assumed that you're getting

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.920
it in a to-go cup or they will ask if you
want it to go or for here and I had

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.450
multiple experiences in Germany of going
to a coffee shop ordering coffee and

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.580
they just assumed I wanted to drink it
there and would as a default serve in

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.950
an actual mug so the default in Germany
was to sit and default in the u.s. is to

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.019
go number two is small talk
Americans are famous for their small

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.030
talk and this is a cultural trait that I
have truly honed I am constantly getting

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.560
into full conversations with complete
strangers anywhere and everywhere whether

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.599
it's the grocery store line an elevator
randomly on the sidewalk at a bar it

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.459
doesn't matter I'm going to be engaging
with strangers at some point during my

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.170
day and probably the most extreme
example that I can give you guys is when

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.280
we were in Vegas recently we rented a
slingshot to be able to drive to the

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.230
Grand Canyon and back and whenever we
got back into the city we were sitting

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.849
at a red light on the way to the rental
place and the woman in the car next to

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.109
us rolled down our window to ask us
about the slingshot and then she and I

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.130
just like went into a full-blown
conversation about the value of homemade

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.190
gifts that is like how random these
conversations are we were in a street in

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.750
vehicles still talking to each other
about a topic that I don't even know why

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.919
we were talking about that and after
that conversation ended Misha just like

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.760
looked at me and shook his head and
laughed and said but he always says

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.900
which is why do you keep making friends
with complete strangers because this is

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.489
like a normal daily occurrence for me
and it's so weird to him because in

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.760
Germany you just don't really do a lot
of small talk and so he doesn't

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.810
understand why I'm doing it and he
definitely doesn't understand why I love

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.019
it as much as I do
but it has been really fun for me to see

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.190
him engaging in some obligatory small
talk since he's been in the u.s. with me

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.139
and he just doesn't really like know how
to handle it so he always comes off

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:14.290
kind of awkwardly because he doesn't understand why

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.489
this stranger just suddenly decided to
strike up a conversation with him using

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.160
cards to pay for small purchases in my
video where I talk about Misha's weird

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.270
German habits I brought up the fact that
he uses cash to pay for anything and

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.130
everything no matter how much or how
little it costs because in Germany cash

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.139
is very much king there in fact there
are so many places in Germany that won't

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.669
even accept card they only take cash
because it is so much more highly

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.419
revered for many reasons that I'm not
gonna get into in this video but

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.940
Americans are very different in this
regard

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.040
much like the Swedes and the Dutch
Americans are more prone to use their

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.530
card for payments mine Americans might
even be on the more extreme end of the

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.760
scale with this because I see people
paying for like a $2 coffee with a

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.800
credit card or it's nothing for me to
pay for like an 85 cent bag of pretzels

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.800
with a card as long as the store doesn't
have like a minimum purchase requirement

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.630
like threshold I'm probably going to use
my card to pay for it more specifically

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.090
I'm going to use my Apple pay because it
takes literally 2.3 seconds for that

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.350
transaction to go through it's the
fastest way I can pay for something and

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.100
it is so super convenient when I just
have my Apple watch on and just put it

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.310
against the sensor and automatically
I've paid for what I want

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.150
Misha hates this because it is so
completely different from what he's used

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.289
to and what he's done in his entire life
and whenever we were living in Germany

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:49.570
my tendency to use card payments would
sometimes caus issues because the

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.630
place wouldn't take a card and I
wouldn't ever have cash on me because I

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.760
just never got used to the Cash is King
thing in Germany or the card machine

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.930
would take a really really long time for
the transaction I don't know why it is

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:08.530
so much longer for card payments in
Germany compared to the US but it is but

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.570
I love it because I hate carrying cash
especially coins so carrying the euro

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:19.060
coins was truly like an event for me I
also think that it's way faster like I

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.750
said although maybe that's just in the
US and not in Germany and then I

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.890
like that I can review my bank
statements and see every single purchase

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.970
that I've made because I'm able to see
exactly how much I paid for something

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.170
because I don't keep receipts I don't
know anybody that does that or maybe I

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.680
want to refer to like the exact date
that I purchased something and that's

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.970
there on my bank statement and it
actually helps me to assess whether or

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.830
not I'm staying on my budget plan
because I can look to see if I am paying

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.360
more than what I've allocated in a
specific category like entertainment or

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.820
food so I find a lot of value in having
all of my transactions recorded on my

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.470
bank statements and I know I'm opening
myself up to getting hundreds of very

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.640
very passionate comments telling me that
I'm very stupid for this or that

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.480
Americans don't have true freedom
because we're tied for our credit cards

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.560
and we don't use cash but I guess
Americans like many other countries

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.390
outside of Germany are just more
comfortable paying with card and trust

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.350
their banks more I am thinking about
doing an experiment though where I take

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:29.030
a week where I pay for everything as I
normally would and compare it to a week

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:34.250
where I use only cash to see if my
spending habits are influenced at all by

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.910
using just cash if that's something that
you guys would be interested in me

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:41.840
vlogging let me know in the comments I
think it could be a lot of fun or it

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.330
could be very boring so let me know my
road rage now I don't necessarily want

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.620
to use the term road rage because when I
hear road rage I think of like an overly

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.540
aggressive and very angry person just
going psycho on the roads and that does

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:02.870
not describe me I'm more of an irritable
driver who will occasionally do a

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:08.030
passive-aggressive maneuver out of
resentment for another driver I just

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:12.530
don't think there's a word in the
English lexicon to cover that exact

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:17.270
description maybe the specificity of the
German language lends itself to having

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.830
such a word and if you do know a word in
German for that please let me know in

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.669
the comments because then I will learn
something new and use that word probably

00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:29.380
on a daily basis anyway I feel
this is like a really normal thing in

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:34.180
the u.s. unless I just happen to be
friends with the only Americans who do

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:39.790
this but it drives Misha crazy because he
just doesn't want to hear me narrate our

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:43.960
drive and explain why a guy just poorly
maneuvered through a four-way

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.730
intersection or tell a car that can't
hear me who's driving in the left lane

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:52.870
and not passing any cars to get over to
the right lane like it just it just

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:57.820
drives him crazy and I get that and I've
gotten a lot better but I do still have

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:03.550
some room to grow all right last one
thankfully because the Sun is coming for

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:08.080
me and it's gonna get really weird here
in a second but the last one is

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.640
frequently going out to eat now I looked
up some statistics on this before

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.270
sitting down to film this video and I
found that the average American will

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:20.530
spend more than half of their food
budget on restaurant meals and that this

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:24.760
is on the rise which to me is not
surprising at all now I grew up in a

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.300
family that rarely ever went out to eat
in fact my parents still don't ever go

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:33.190
out to eat unless they're traveling but
as soon as I left home and got my own

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:38.110
job I steered in the complete opposite
direction it's not that I don't like

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:44.620
cooking cuz I do like cooking fairly
enough but I hate grocery shopping it is

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:51.490
my least favorite chore or errand to run
I hate it and also by the time I'm done

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:55.540
with like a full day of work I don't
feel like cooking so I'm really

00:09:55.540 --> 00:10:00.100
susceptible to giving in to ordering
some delivery or grabbing something on

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:05.470
my way home just so I can relax more
when I get home with moving to DC this

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.460
habit of mine has dramatically
worsened because DC is an extremely

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:15.310
social city that really thrives on
networking over drinks or a meal so now

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:20.320
I have a legitimate reason to abandon my
kitchen to go out to a fun restaurant

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.770
and really it just becomes a
give-and-take where I'm giving up some

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:28.690
monetary discipline in exchange for some
social reward or some potential

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:33.820
professional benefits but by default
Misha doesn't see like the benefit to me

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:37.810
going out to these types of events
instead he just sees me going to a

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.940
restaurant and
a lot of money on a meal that I could

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:45.500
have made at home for a fraction of the
cost so to him it's really weird

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:49.160
all right so while I was editing this
video I realized that there are two more

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.750
American habits that I have that drive
my boyfriend crazy that I want to share

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:59.690
with you guys cuz I just did them so for
number six I hyperbolize all the time

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:04.730
and I realize that I do that is I use
the most extreme version of what I'm

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:09.530
feeling so instead of saying I'm hungry
I'll say I'm starving instead of saying

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:15.380
I'm tired I'll say I'm exhausted even in
my youtube videos I'm always using words

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:20.240
like weird and crazy and I've realized that
how I mean those words and how I use

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:25.520
them as an American is not how non
Americans perceive those words weird is

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.680
just another way for me to say different
And Misha hates and I guess they shouldn't

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:36.440
use the word hate Misha doesn't like how
I hyperbolize all the time because it

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:42.470
really cuts down the range of what I'm
trying to say I totally get how this can

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.350
be harmful when communicating with
someone because if you're always using

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:50.600
the most extreme and exaggerated way to
express what you're feeling then it's

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:55.130
hard to tell what's important versus
what's not important so because of my

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:59.600
habit of hyperbolizing Misha tends to
call me his little drama queen because

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.200
everything sounds like an emergency
because I'm always exaggerating

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.950
everything in fact I think I just
hyperbolized like 18 different times in

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:11.060
the past minute just talking to you guys
now so you can see it's a pretty bad

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:16.550
habit and I probably should work on
fixing that and number seven the real

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:21.770
last have a I'll go over in this video
is always posting on social media I'm

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:25.460
sure it's not surprising to any of you
that someone who is willing to put

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.510
themselves out there on YouTube probably
posts on social media a lot I'm always

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:34.370
uploading photos on Facebook and
Instagram I post YouTube videos every

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:38.420
single week and I'm constantly trolling
the comments section of my videos

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:42.470
and Misha even asked me the other day how I can be so comfortable with

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:46.190
spontaneously posting on different
social media platforms because of how

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:49.490
frequently I do it
and I recognize that because I'm on

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:55.100
YouTube I might not be the best example
for which to base the average American's

00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:00.770
use of social media so I'll put it to
you this way Misha has 250 friends on

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:06.440
Facebook and of those 250 friends about
10 are Americans whom he met through me

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:11.810
and those ten Americans post so much on
their Facebook pages that it completely

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.840
consumes
Misha's feed his German friends just

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.110
hardly ever post on Facebook and it's
not like there's a different social

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:22.700
media platform out there that Germans
prefer over Facebook they just don't put

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.450
themselves out there as much as
Americans do and I think it goes back to

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:31.850
this idea that Germans are often more
concerned about privacy than Americans

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:35.330
