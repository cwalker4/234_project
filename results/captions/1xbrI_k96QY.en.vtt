00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.940
I don't know if I can ever trust your again Sebastian after you slept with my twin sister I

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.420
I thought she was you Diana...

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.820
Am I really supposed to believe that Sebastian?

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.480
Believe this Diane:

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.580
Whenever I see you my heart fills up like a balloon

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.180
Oh... kiss me fool

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.940
Oh Sebastian! Oh Diana!

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.820
Hey mom, what's for dinner?

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.820
Oh no! Dinner!

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.020
Yes

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:04.699
If you will turn your attention to your left you will see what the humans used to call toaster

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.869
This device was utilized to warm their food consumptions

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.509
And if you will follow me you will find our most popular exhibit

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.630
Our historians have successfully replicated the living conditions of the humans

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.360
before their classification as

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.949
Endangered species, this is home to the only human raised in captivity. We call him Jim

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.950
Good morning, Jim

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.110
We encourage you all to return tonight for a new addition to our exhibit a female

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.489
Whenever I see you my heart fills up like a balloon

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.750
Nice to meet you.. Oh, I'm sorry

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.359
Did you want a tour? This is the kitchen latest state-of-the-art appliances?

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.080
That's the master bathroom, there's a and heated toilet seat it in there and those are pictures of me.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.170
This is the living room and this is the finest collection of cereal toy prizes that you'll ever see.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.170
You can touch one if you want - No! Don't go in there.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.170
I wanted that to be a surprise.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:16.220
Hi, I'm Jim you're Jim

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.220
You're Jim?
Oh shit!

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.280
Okay, okay, okay, okay?

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.260
There's got to be a way out of here do you know where it is?

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:37.680
A way out? Why would I ever want to way out of this place? this place is great! I get complimentary meals

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.269
Unlimited thirst-quenching energy drinks. That's not it look at this

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.940
that and

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.479
The TV over five channels on it

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.160
Munchie ma'am frozen dinners

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.750
What's wrong? Did I overcook your hardy chicken parmigiana

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.740
Mmm. It's good.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.560
Have you ever been outside?

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.300
Smell that

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.220
Hmm what does it smell like to you?

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.960
Over 13 artificial flavors blend into perfection?

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.660
This isn't what real food smells like!

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.740
All right none of this is real

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.940
None of it is real

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.800
OK

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.960
Not the food not the flowers and and ...

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.760
the staircase it doesn't even go anywhere

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.540
Did you ever think I was weird, so there's just a wall the top of the stairs and the stupid door

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.779
only opens four inches

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.870
Doesn't it bother you

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.060
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.780
Okay.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.780
You join me you can join me if you want to you can join me in the bed

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.540
That's the point

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.660
We're supposed...

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.060
...propagate...

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.760
I will never ever

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.320
Propagate with you go, please

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.010
Are you gonna come?

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.970
You haven't even given this place a chance

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.580
What did you do with my cereal prizes?

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.620
That's the outside world Jim, that's my home

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.240
This is your home now with me

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.920
This will never be my home

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.200
I..

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.920
I think I thought of a way out

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.760
Every few days an attendant comes in

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.540
Through there. He has a cart.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.000
And I think you can hide in there

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
What about you aren't you coming too?

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.420
The cart isn't big enough for the both of us.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.440
Jim

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.300
You don't belong in here

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.160
Don't worry about me.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.420
I'm happy here

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.780
You are certain you do not know where the female is

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.220
At least you are still here, Jim

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:13.660
...their classification as endangered species in year 2052

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.860
this habitat is home to the only human raised in captivity

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.760
We call him Jim

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.040
Good morning, Jim

00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:26.759
