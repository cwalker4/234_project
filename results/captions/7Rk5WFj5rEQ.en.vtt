00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.130
I AM A MAN. I AM A NATION.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.870

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.540
WE NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.310

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.320
SO, HERE I AM ONSTAGE AT UCLA,

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.290
IN FRONT OF A ROOMFUL OF STRANGERS, SO WHAT DO I SAY?

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.690
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.460
GLENNON'S TALKING ABOUT HOT YOGA.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.090
GARY'S TALKING ABOUT THE SEED OF THE SOUL.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.000
BUT IF YOUR HEART IS BROKEN, HOW CAN YOU EVER BE MADE WHOLE?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.770
AND, SO, HERE WE ARE, AND YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.400
"IS THAT SUGE KNIGHT? WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?"

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:12.180

SO, THEY PUT ME UP BEHIND A RHODES SCHOLAR NAMED WES.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.950
I GOT A DOUBLE HIGH-SCHOOL DIPLOMA,

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.050
BUT IT DON'T MEAN I'M NOT BLESSED.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.590
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.760
YOU'RE WONDERING, AM I GONNA RHYME FOR THE ENTIRE SESSION?

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.260
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.100
DON'T WORRY, RELAX. IT'S JUST A PART OF MY EXPRESSION.

[ LAUGHTER ]

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.070
SO, WHAT IS THE BRIDGE?

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.770
A BRIDGE IS AN EXCHANGE OF IDEAS.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.000
IT'S A PLACE OF INTERCONNECTED HUMANITY,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.010
WHERE WE COME AND HAVE DIALOGUE

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.240
WITHOUT THE FEAR OF BEING JUDGED OR MALIGNED

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.340
FOR OUR PERSONAL IDEOLOGY.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.380
A BRIDGE ITSELF IS A SPAN

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.480
THAT ALLOWS TWO FIXED POINTS

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.420
THAT WOULD NEVER CONNECT

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.220
TO HAVE AN ABILITY TO MEET OVER OBJECTS AND IMPEDIMENTS

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.000
THAT WOULD NORMALLY KEEP THESE TWO FIXED OBJECTS FROM MEETING.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.500
WE ARE IN A VERY DIFFICULT TIME IN OUR NATION.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.970
IT'S BAD.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.430
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.570
IT'S BAD, MAN!

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.440
THERE'S A LOT GOING ON.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.410
AND EVERYBODY COMES FROM A DIFFERENT PLACE.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.610
EVERYBODY HAS THEIR OWN LENS, THEIR OWN PERSPECTIVE,

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.980
AND THE MOMENT YOU INVALIDATE SOMEONE ELSE'S PERSPECTIVE,

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.420
YOU DEHUMANIZE THEM.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.450
IF WE'RE REALLY GONNA GROW, IF WE'RE REALLY GONNA CHANGE,

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.590
THEN WE NEED TO SET OUR MINDS TO BE REARRANGED.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.330
AND, SO, ONCE AGAIN, JUST SIT UP IN THE CHAIR,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.030
GRAB A DRINK FROM THE FRIDGE, AND LET'S HAVE A CONVERSATION.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.100
JUST MEET ME ON THE BRIDGE.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.870
THIS PLACE,

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.010
THIS MOMENT IS HISTORIC,

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.480
BECAUSE YOU CAME HERE BECAUSE YOU WERE SEEKING SOMETHING.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.680
YOU ARE HUNGRY FOR SOMETHING. YOU ARE HUNGRY FOR TRUTH.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.580
NOT TRUTH IN ITS ETHEREAL FORM, BUT TRUTH IN A SUBSTANTIVE FORM.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.620
BUT ALL OF US COME FROM A DIFFERENT PLACE.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.820
YOU KNOW, NOW WE'RE REAL LOCKED IN TO OUR IDEOLOGIES.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.760
MAYBE YOU'RE FAR RIGHT OR MAYBE YOU'RE FAR LEFT,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.800
AND IT'S HARD TO MEET IN THE MIDDLE, BECAUSE, ME,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.900
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT, "WHERE DO I FIT IN?"

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.240
BECAUSE AT THE INTERSECTION OF FAITH, POLITICS,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.800
AND SOCIAL JUSTICE,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.610
I'M JUST A LITTLE PREACHER FROM A SMALL-TOWN CINCINNATI CHURCH.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.910
AND NOW I'M SITTING AT THE CHURCH

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.840
WITH THE NICEST MAN IN THE WORLD.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.550
JOEL OSTEEN IS LITERALLY THE NICEST DUDE IN THE WORLD.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.820
HE SMILES AT EVERYTHING.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.220
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.820
NO, FOR REAL. IF YOU PUT HIM IN A HORROR MOVIE,

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.160
HE WOULD STILL SMILE.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.060
YOU PUT HIM IN "FRIDAY THE 13th,"

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.700
YOU HEAR THE MUSIC... "CHH, CHH, CHH, CHH!

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.900

"WELL, JASON, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.300
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO STAB PEOPLE.

YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LOVE PEOPLE.

OH, JASON, DON'T YOU KNOW YOU COULD LIVE YOUR BEST LIFE NOW?

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.650
