00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.440
This is William Clark Gable, one of the

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.350
most successful Hollywood leading men

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.520
ever

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.630
and one of the most unlikel, his ears

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.180
were too big and stuck out there were

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.360
gaps between his teeth and his voice was

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.739
high and loud. Clark Gable was born Feb.

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.730
1st, 1901 in Cades Ohio.  He was the

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.230
only child of William Henry Gable &amp;

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.180
Adaline Hirschmann Gable.  Clark's

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.190
father was an experienced oil well

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.010
driller,  his mother Adaline was a

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.040
housewife that unfortunately passed away

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.120
when Clark was only 10 months old. She

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.330
died on a fourteenth of november 1901

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.170
believed from a seizure that was probably

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.520
caused from a brain tumor. Clark was sent

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.590
to live with Adalines family in Meadsville

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.320
Pennsylvania while his father

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.930
William return to oil fields in Ohio.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.340
There his father meets and marrys Jeannie

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.490
Dunlap on the sixteenth of April 1903

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.180
The couple quickly reclaim young Clark

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.390
and the family moved to Jenny's hometown

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.469
Hopedale Ohio. Clark Gable will spend some

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:37.689
of the happiest days of his life in

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.350
Hopedale and in this house. He was

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.380
pampered by step mother being an only

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.250
child she considered him as her own. She

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.640
keep him clean and well-groomed. Clark

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.679
was considered a good student and love

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.710
music and the arts,  thanks to Jeannie.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.470
Now this is Clark showing off his

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.470
musical talents as a youngster while

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.760
playing in all adult band and this is

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.080
clark at Hopewell Highschool in 1916. He's

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.989
on the second row from the front and

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.500
second from the right. The next year in

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.400
1917 the Clark family moved to this farm

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.290
at 3150 Alliance Road. It's now county

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.570
road 125 in Pelmier Ohio.  It's near

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.810
Akron. He attended Edinburgh high school

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.690
for a short time where he actually rode

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.260
a horse to school and back each day. Clark

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.040
soon grew tired of farm work. He quit

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.330
school at age of 16, got a job in Akron

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.300
at a rubber tire plant. Now this is the

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.489
Miller tire company that Clark was

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.269
working at when he visited the Akron

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.600
music hall one afternoon after work to

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.120
see the performance of The Bird of

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.209
Paradise. Clark Gable knew immediately

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.799
what he wanted to be. An actor. Acting

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.930
was better than farming and factory work

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.510
and he volunteered at the Playhouse

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.000
doing whatever they wanted him to do

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.760
sweeping floors running errands he even

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.870
had one walk-on part as an extra. His

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.720
first taste of acting was cut short when

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.239
he learned that Jenny, his stepmother, had

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.880
died at their farm on January the 11th

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.140
1920 of tuberculosis and cancer of the

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.220
bowels.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.900
Jenny is buried in the Palmar cemetery just

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.600
down the road from their home.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.270
William Clark's name is on her tombstone

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.020
but he's buried in California and died

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.670
in 1948. Soon after Jeannys death William

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.730
Clark moved to the oil fields of Oklahoma

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.020
and Clark soon followed his dad. After

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.380
two years of working in the oil fields

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.560
he had saved enough money. Clark joined

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.450
another theater group

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.930
unfortunately the group soon went broke

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.480
leaving Clark and others stranded in

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.290
Butte Montana making his way finally to

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.980
Oregan with a fellow actor and after working

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.680
in several different jobs he managed to

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.919
join another theater group. There he

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.460
meets Josephine Dylan, theatre manager

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.520
and acting coach. She took a personal

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.850
interest in Clark determined to make an

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.630
actor out of Clark Gable. She paid to

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.820
have his teeth fixed, filling in the

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.810
front gaps. She had his hair styled and

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.090
told him how to lower his high-pitched

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.169
voice

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.590
unfortunately, there's not much you can

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.050
do about his large ears that stuck out.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.020
Now this proved to be the biggest

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.360
obstacle to getting into the movie

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.720
business. Years later his ears will be

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.110
operated on and that will help some.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.229
Although Josephine was several years

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.380
older than Clark the couple were married

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.640
in December of 1924 and they'll move to

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.150
Hollywood. Money will be tight and what

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.030
extra there was from Josephine's acting

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.240
classes will be spent on Clark trying to

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.630
break into the movie business. For the

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.780
next few years Gable will play extras in

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.040
several silent films

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.570
and in 1926 Clark and Josephine will

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.080
separate. He will begin keeping company

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.780
with wealthy women that he thought could

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.080
further his career. For awhile he will

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.660
leave Hollywood and try to return to the

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.670
state. In 1930 Josephine will file

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.820
for divorce on grounds of desertion. She

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.250
will always say that Gable married his

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.270
second wife Ria Lingham because Ria

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.700
could do more for his career than she

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.780
could. Gables marriage to Josephine was

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:21.980
strange.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.410
He always said that the marriage was

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.440
never consummated and it was a marriage

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.460
of convenience only, however, it will be the

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.400
only marriage for Josephine and she'll

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.630
always claim to love Clark. She soon

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.540
fell on hard times after the divorce.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.320
A few years later she went to L.B. Mayer

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.810
saying  Clark was not helping her

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.510
financially and threatened to go to the

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.750
newspapers. Mayor begin taking two

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.840
hundred dollars out of Clark's pay to

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.630
send to Josephine. It was later shown

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.630
that Gable sent her money to keep her from

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.540
foreclosure on her modest home.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.180
He also left provisions to pay of her

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:13.310
mortgage.  41 years after her divorce from

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.010
Clark Gable on the 11th of November

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:22.130
1971, Josephine Dylan will die of a long

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.580
time illness at a sanatorium in Glendale.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.460
She'll be buried at the Calvary Cemetery

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:33.830
in East Los Angeles. Josephine was 87

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.820
years old.  While Clark was separated from

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:38.320
Josephine in 1930 he met Maria Langham

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:44.600
while in New York working back on

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.500
the stage. Although Ria as she was called,

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.070
was several years older than Gable,

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.260
she was from a socially prominent

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:54.760
wealthy Texas family

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.479
and could afford to help his career

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:01.539
back to where he really wanted to be in

00:08:01.539 --> 00:08:05.500
hollywood working on movies. They were

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.430
married  April 3rd, 1931. Gable will

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.430
be her fourth marriage and his second.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.970
While married to Ria Langham,  and with

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.009
her help, he will become more

00:08:18.009 --> 00:08:21.789
sophisticated and polished. His movie

00:08:21.789 --> 00:08:24.250
career will begin to drastically improve.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.000
He will get his first speaking role in

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.870
The Painted Desert with William Boyd. Now

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.570
this was before Boyd became Hopalong Cassidy.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:38.770
MGM will offer Clark a contract

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.599
after seeing his performance in The

00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:43.419
Painted Desert. They will give him his

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.870
first leading role in Dance Fools Dance

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:51.640
with Joan Crawford. Clark Gable will be a

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.270
leading man for the next 30 years.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:59.800
In 1932 he stars in Red Dust with Jean

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.339
Harlow.  The next year he teams up again

00:09:03.339 --> 00:09:06.010
with Joan Crawford in Dancing Lady.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.610
Also, a young Fred Astaire will make his

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.980
first dancing appearance on the screen

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.279
During the filming of Dancing Lady

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:19.450
Gable will become hospitalized with

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:22.870
infected teeth. the infection will spread

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.930
through his body causing him to have to

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:29.080
have all of his teeth pulled.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.230
This caused delay in filming and cost

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:33.710
the studio money.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.800
As punishment, Clark was rented out to

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.620
the low-budget Columbia Pictures for a

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:44.600
comedy called It Happened One Night. Gable

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.640
thought the picture was awful he didn't

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.900
like it.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.450
The picture was turned down by several

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.850
actresses before Claudette Colbert

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:57.470
agreed, at double her wages, to take it.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.890
Colbert and Gable both thought the little

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.580
movie was stupid but the public loved it.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.510
It will be the only Academy Award

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:13.070
Clark Gable will ever receive. The movie

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.130
will recieve five Academy Awards putting

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.770
Clark Gable back in the good graces of

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:23.150
MGM executives. In the early part of 1935

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:27.380
Gable will star with Loretta Young in

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.170
The Call of the Wild. During the

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.870
filming Loretta and Gable will become

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.690
romantically involved, or at least that's

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:38.810
what everyone thought. After filming

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.610
Loretta will discovered that she's

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:41.630
pregnant

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:44.690
Both Loretta and Clark have morals

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:48.080
clauses in their contracts and if the studio

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.810
found out about her pregnancy they would

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:54.950
both lose their contracts. Loretta took a

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.370
long trip to Europe.  Judy, their daughter

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:01.970
was born in November that year. Loretta

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:04.430
went to great lengths to hide the fact

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.370
that Judy was her own daughter. She

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.190
claimed to have adopted Judy and it was

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.140
years before Judy discovered that

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.140
Loretta Young and Clark Gable were her

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.850
natural parents.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.250
Clark Gable will never publicly

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:23.630
acknowledged his daughter. In 1940, when

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:25.370
Judy was four years old

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.339
Loretta Young will marry producer Tom

00:11:28.339 --> 00:11:32.300
Lewis. Judy will take Lewis  last name.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.480
Tom and  Loretta will have two sons during

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.529
their marriage.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:39.980
Christopher and Peter. Loretta and Tom

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:40.480

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:50.480
She will not marry again unti 1993 at the age of 80.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.050
She'll meet Gene Louis, a fashion

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:57.589
designer that years earlier had designed

00:11:57.589 --> 00:11:59.870
her gowns for the Loretta Young show.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:05.269
They will remain married until his death four

00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:09.860
years later in 1997. That same year she

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:13.759
married Gene Louis, Loretta will buy this

00:12:13.759 --> 00:12:19.160

00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:27.139
in 2004. Loretta Young will died of

00:12:27.139 --> 00:12:30.110

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:34.370
at the age of 87, while staying

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:37.579
at the home of her sister Georgina Montavon

00:12:37.579 --> 00:12:42.589
the wife of Ricardo Montavon.  Judy

00:12:42.589 --> 00:12:44.959
Lewis the daughter of Loretta Young and

00:12:44.959 --> 00:12:47.660
Clark Gable will die of cancer on

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:53.000
November 25th,  2011 at the age of 76,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.259
51 years after her father Clark Gable's

00:12:57.259 --> 00:13:00.800
death and 11 years after her mother

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.939
Loretta Young. The same year 1935 that

00:13:04.939 --> 00:13:07.500
Clark Gable stared with Loretta Young

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.200
in The Call of the Wild, he will also

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.860
share billing with Charles Laughton in

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.490
Mutiny on the Bounty. He didn't like it

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.130
because he was told he had to shave off

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:24.090
his famous mustache to get the part. He

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.240
felt better after being nominated for

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.570
the academy award. The next year he will

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:33.330
star with Jeanette MacDonald in San

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.920
Francisco and in 1937 he'll be paired

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.940
with a younger actress Jean Harlow in

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.150
Saratoga. Harlow had been in poor health

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.820
before filming began and on the

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.700
29th of May,  during a love scene

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.640
Harlow actually collapsed in Gables arms

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.960
from exhaustion.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.440
Doctors diagnosed her with gall bladder

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.470
infection. After several days and not

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:05.250
returning to the set, Gable visits Jean

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.880
at her home. He becomes concerned when he

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.270
sees her condition. On the 6th of June

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:14.910
and days after she had collapsed on the

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:18.240
set of Saratoga, she's taken to the Good

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.630
Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles with a

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:25.500
new diagnosis of acute kidney infection.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.740
The medicine prescribed for her gallbladder

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:33.150
was now killing her. In 1937 there was no

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:37.110
antibiotics for kidney infection after

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.910
arriving at the hospital

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.750
Jean quickly slipped into a coma and on

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.960
the 7th of June, 1937 at

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.950
11:37am Jean Harlow will pass

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:54.300
away at the age of 26. She will be buried

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.030
in the mausoleum at Forrest Lawn  Memorial

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.990
Park in Glendale.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:02.290
Clark Gable will attend Jeans funeral

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:04.779
with his new love interest

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:08.200
Carole Lombard. It will be two more years

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.800
in 1939 before Gable gets his divorce from

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.370
Maria Langham and is able to marry

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:18.760
Carole Lombard. That same year Clark

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.310
Gable with star in his most famous role

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:26.200
as Rhett Butler in Gone with the Wind.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.750
The studio will up his salary so that he can

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.690
afford to pay Maria her demand so that

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:35.140
she will give him a divorce. Ria will

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.200
stay in Hollywood a few years after

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.600
divorcing Clark. She will date other

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.589
actors but she will never remarry.  She will

00:15:44.589 --> 00:15:47.860
eventually return to Houston. She will

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:52.390
pass away on September the 24th 1966 at

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:54.279
the age of 82.

00:15:54.279 --> 00:15:56.620
She's buried in the Glendale cemetery in

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.910
Houston.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:00.760
She'll be remembered in Houston society

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.390
as once being the wife of Clark Gable.

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:07.839
It was well known that the studio heads

00:16:07.839 --> 00:16:10.180
decided that the part of Rhett Butler

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:13.450
could only be played by Clark Gable. Even

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.430
though Gable will refuse to use a

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:19.270
southern accent. Carole Lombard had

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.430
hoped that she would get the part of

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.160
Scarlett O'Hara so that she could work

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.390
with Clark.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:25.890
However, the part of Scarlett went to Vivian Leigh.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:32.320
Gone with the Wind will become one

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.170
of the best-known films ever.

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.839
It will secure the film legend of

00:16:37.839 --> 00:16:40.990
Clark Gable.  It will recieve 10 Academy

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:44.890
Awards. Gable will be nominated for best

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:47.380
actor, but he won't win.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.050
However, his co-star Vivien Leigh will.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:53.709
One of the most famous lines in movie

00:16:53.709 --> 00:16:54.740
history

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:59.089
"Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"  that

00:16:59.089 --> 00:17:04.069
one word cost the studio $5,000 and they

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:06.439
said it was completely worth it.

00:17:06.439 --> 00:17:10.220
Clark Gable was now finally divorced from

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.370
Ria and Lombard had been divorced from

00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:15.829
William Dick Powell since 1933.

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:19.250
After a break in the filming

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.189
of Gone with the Wind,  Carol and Clark

00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:26.420
and best man Outto Winkle drove to

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:31.280
Kingman Arizona on the 29th of  March 1939 and

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.780
got married.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.929
Gable said this time with Lombard was the

00:17:35.929 --> 00:17:38.540
happiest time of his entire life.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.240
The couple bought a farm in Encino

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:41.740
California located at 16645 Ashley Oaks.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:50.900
They raised chickens, horses and

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.380
cows.  Clark bought a tractor Carol

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.720
redecorate the house and seemed content

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.530
to be a housewife and love the idea of

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:04.580
being Carole Lombard Gable.  Only a few

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:07.309
weeks after the start of World War 2

00:18:07.309 --> 00:18:10.730
Carole Lombard was asked to go on a Bond

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:14.150
Drive in order to help the war cause.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.700
At the same time Clark was filming Somewhere

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:20.390
I'll find You with Lana Turner.  Carol had

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.790
just finished what will be her last film

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:27.770
To Be or Not to Be with Jack Benny and

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:29.130
Robert Stack.

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.280
The volunteer left by train heading for

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.870
Indiana on the 12th of January, 1942.  After a

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:40.110
successful Bond Drive, Carol was anxious to

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:43.230
get back to her home and her husband. She

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:46.080
was accompanied by her mother Elizabeth

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.620
Peters.  Clark Gable's publicity agent and

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.570
best man at his wedding

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:56.220
Outto Winkler was also alone. The TWA

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.980
transcontinental flight 3 will stop in Las

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.830
Vegas Nevada to refuel.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.170
Clark Gable was anxious to see his wife

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:07.620
returning early.  He goes to the airport

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:11.700
to wait his wife's arrival.  The DC 3 with

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.810
22 people aboard left Las Vegas minutes

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:21.930
after 7pm on January 16th, 1942.

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:26.190
30 miles southwest of Vegas for no apparent

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:27.090
reason

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:30.090
flight 3 explodes into a nevada mountain side

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.990
killing all aboard.  Rescuers

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:35.730
are seen here

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.730
removing Carol Lombards body wrapped in a

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:39.690
blanket.

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.450
Carol and her mother will be buried in

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:44.400
the mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.060
Park in Glendale California. The same

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.490
mausoleum that Jean Harlow was buried in

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:52.260
some four years earlier.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:57.630
Carole Lombard was 33 years old.

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:00.240
The entire nation will mourn alone with

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.670
Clark Gable the death of his wife.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:06.000
Clark will keep their home in Encino

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.180
the rest of his life. He will refuse to

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.640
allow any changes to her bedroom for

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.540
years.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.640
Friends say he was emotionally

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.330
devastated.  Both Clark and Carol were

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:22.170
very patriotic but he felt that bond

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:25.770
drives was not enough, so after her death

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:29.100
he enlisted and did 13 weeks of officer

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.040
training school. He ended up assigned to

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:36.750
the 351st bombardment group.  His job was

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:41.070
to film a record of bombing missions.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:44.070
This is a picture taken by Captain Clark.

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:47.460
Now this is Captain Clark getting ready

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.900
to go on a mission.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.080
He was also trained as an Ariel gunner.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.310
There were no free rides. His plane was

00:20:56.310 --> 00:21:00.000
hit several times once by spitfire and

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.390
other times by strapnal,  barely missing him.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:06.810
Major Gable resigned from service June

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:11.040
12th,  1944 for being over age for combat.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:16.290
In 1945 Adventure, with a Greer Garson

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:18.420
will be his first movie after his

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:22.800
military career. In 1947 he will star in

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.760
the Hucksters with Deborah Carr and Ava

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.990
Gardner and in 1948 it'll be Homecoming

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:34.860
with Lana Turner and Anne Baxter.The next

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:38.010
year in 1949, almost eight years after

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:41.250
Carole Lombards death, Clark Gable will

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:44.700
marry model and actress Sylvia Ashley,  the

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.790
widow of her second husband Douglas

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:50.940
Fairbanks senior. They will slip away

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:55.220
from reporters on the 20th of December 1949

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.409
to a friend's home near Santa Barbara

00:21:57.409 --> 00:22:00.559
and marry. After a two-week honeymoon in

00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:03.530
Hawaii the couple returned to the ranch

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:04.640
house

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.260
Sylvia will start redecorating

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:09.830
the house, even Carol's bedroom, the

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:11.480
marriage seemed doomed from the

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.059
beginning.  While still married to Sylvia

00:22:14.059 --> 00:22:18.260
Clark with star in Key to the City with

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:22.640
no other than Loretta Young. This must

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:26.299
have been awkward for both actors, and in

00:22:26.299 --> 00:22:30.049
1952 Clark Gable and Sylvia Ashley will

00:22:30.049 --> 00:22:32.390
divorce after less than two-and-a-half

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:35.809

his contract along with Greer Garson's

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:57.320
Judy Garland's and others. They were

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.840
cutting back on high salary actors.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.760
During 1954 Clark became withdrawn and

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.210
depressed. He was always a heavy drinker

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:11.020
but it became worse.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:11.520

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:17.170

previous marriage that Clark will come

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:45.460
to love.  The same year that

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:49.480
Clark marrys Kay,  he stars in The Tall Man

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:54.280

57 he will work with Burt Lancaster in

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:04.000
Run Silent Run Deep. In 1960 at the age

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.300
of 59 and after decades of being the

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.180
most consistent box-office performer

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:13.960
ever, Clark Gable will star in his last

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:18.550
screen performance in The Misfits.

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:20.710
His co-star will be Marilyn Monroe

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:24.160
Montgomery Clift and Eli Wallach.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.860
Eli Wallach is considered one of the

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:31.330
best character actors in Hollywood. He

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.270
will die years after The Misfits in New

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:38.140
York City on June 24th, 2014

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:42.340
at the age of 98.  Montgomery Cliff will die

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.980

in The Misfits on July the 23rd, 1966 at

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.350
the age of 45.  The last words that

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:56.980
Montgomery Clift will speak is when a

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.830
friend asked him if he wished to watch The

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:02.890
Misfits on television with him.

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:07.000
His answer was absolutely not.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Marilyn Monroe will die of a drug

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.080
overdose

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.290
two years later after finishing Misfits

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:14.790
on the 5th of August, 1962. She was 36 years

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:24.130
At the beginning of Misfits Clark

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:26.410
Gable received a star on the Hollywood

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:31.210
Walk of Fame on February the 8th, 1960.

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:31.710
It's located at 1608

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:37.330
Vine Street. In order to play his part as

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:40.750
the old cowboy Gaylord Landing, Clark

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:44.110
lost 35 pounds and had to cut back on

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:47.740
the booze.  When Marilyn became too

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:51.160
infatuated with her co-sta,r as she often

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.190
did while shooting movies, they say that

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:56.170
Clark would pull out his teeth and do

00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:59.590
his best impression of Gabby Hayes. That

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:02.890
usually did the trick.  During filming of

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:05.800
Misfits Clark Gable will learn his wife

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.040
Kay is pregnant with his son he will never

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.610
see.  Clark was delighted and looking

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:15.700
forward to the future. Three days after

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.170
finishing filming,

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:19.390
Clark Gable will be rushed to the

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:23.410
hospital on the 6th of  November 1960 while

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:25.170
complaining with chest pains.

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:28.500
Ten days later on the 16th of November

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:33.240
1960, William Clark Gable will die of a

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.240
blood clot related to heart troubles.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:40.320
Kay will allow Clark to be intombed  next to

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:44.340
his third wife Carole Lombard. Clark

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:49.530
Gable was 59 years old.  His only son John

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:52.410

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.040
will later sale their

Encino ranch.  Developers were divide the

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:14.070
ranch into the Gable Estates.  Clark once

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:17.310
asked Kay if she wanted to decorate the

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:21.090
Encino home. Her answer was no,

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:26.010
Carol had good taste so why should I.

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:31.380
This to me was a sign of a kind lady.  Kay Gable

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:33.870

00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:37.560

footsteps into show business.
