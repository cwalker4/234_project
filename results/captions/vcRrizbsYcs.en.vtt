Top 10 Hidden Truths About Historical Artifacts
and Inventions

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:44.020
10.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.129
Iron Maidens Were Not For Torture

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.840
For those of you who don’t know, an Iron
Maiden is an allegedly Medieval torture device

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.539
shaped like a giant coffin that can fit a
person.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.109
The door and the inside have giant spikes
that slowly impale you as the door closes

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.109
in on you.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.809
It’s easily the most metal torture device
ever conceived, which makes sense considering

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.330
a metal band has chosen it as its namesake.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.640
However, to the disappointment of Maiden fans
everywhere, the torture device was never a

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.640
real thing at all.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.060
The Iron Maiden was actually conceived by
the 19th century version of a performance

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.170
artist who cobbled it together from pieces
of other old torture devices.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.439
The artist and his friend gave it to a museum
where it was mistakenly listed as a medieval

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.619
torture device and before long the idea of
the maiden was horrifying and captivating

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.189
people all over the world.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.110
The point of the artists had been to show
how awful the past was compared to the present,

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.229
and to illustrate it by showing an example
of what they thought the worst tortures of

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.090
the past may have looked like.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.360
Instead, people were trolled into thinking
that it was real, and now believe in a device

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.880
that never existed.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.500
The truth is that they didn’t need to make
a new device.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.020
Many medieval torture implements were more
than brutal and horrifying enough that there

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.930
was no need to make fake ones.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.340
Also, the maiden might be a painful way to
kill someone, but it would have been impractical

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.159
as a torture implement.

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.799
Torture was generally used to extract a confession
or get information – a device that killed

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.649
someone so quickly and conclusively would
not have been helpful for that purpose.

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:07.649
9.

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.340
Chastity Belts Are Historically Controversial
And Very Misunderstood

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.349
When most people think of chastity belts,
they think of a time period in history when

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.110
women were treated like objects in many respects.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.959
To many people, chastity belts are a vivid
example of how women have been abused and

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.790
used for sex throughout history.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.830
However, most of what people have been led
to believe about them are wholly false.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.730
Museum exhibits showing what was supposed
to be a prudish, relatively ancient device

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.240
turned out to be made in the 19th century,
and a couple that were from the middle ages

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.709
were judged to actually be dog collars.

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.390
Some historians and museum curators are coming
increasingly to the conclusion that the vast

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.200
majority (if not all) of said devices were
made in recent years sheerly for the purpose

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.200
of amusement.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.120
Now, some have speculated that some very prudish
19th century parents may have used a device

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.790
– very rarely – on daughters who they
thought shouldn’t be acting on sexual urges,

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.940
but there is very little evidence of that
either, and even less that such devices were

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:03.940
used in the middle ages.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.590
In fact, the only solid evidence of them being
used in the middle ages was by the women of

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.590
Florence, Italy.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.239
The important thing to note here is that the
women were not forced into them, but instead

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.730
used them as a means of protection in case
the city was overrun.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.489
Back in the day, invading armies tended to
rape women, so the women had an answer for

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.210
that prepared just in case.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.909
This shows that the furthest back known use
of the device was not as a patriarchal control

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.620
mechanism, but a women’s self defense tool
against rapists.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.659
8.

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:32.040
Powdered Wigs Were Designed To Hide The Symptoms
Of Syphilis

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.519
Many people just think of powdered wigs as
an incredibly odd fashion trend during an

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.620
otherwise remarkable period of history, and
just kind of pay it no heed.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.480
However, while it may have indeed been a silly
trend, it didn’t begin with a whim that

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.549
a wig covered in scented powder would look
really good.

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.690
It turns out that the reason that powdered
wigs came into fashion in the first place

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.900
is because most of the Western World was dealing
with a raging bout of syphilis.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.010
Many, many men were affected, and the symptoms
often were hurtful to people’s social standing

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.239
when it came to their appearance.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.739
It could leave nasty sores, and it caused
hair to fall out.

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.040
This was particularly troublesome at the time,
as baldness was definitely not in fashion.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.180
So, people started turning to wigs to save
their reputations.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.680
Large, embroidered wigs could also help hide
sores or other signs of syphilis.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.720
Eventually King Louis XIV of France and King
Charles II of England started using wigs when

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.540
they contracted the disease, and before long
everyone was wearing a wig whether they actually

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.540
needed one or not.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.420
The powders that became so popular were used
mainly to hide the foul scents that could

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.350
be caused by the symptoms of the disease,
and weren’t really a fashion statement in

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.780
terms of color.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.380
While powdered wigs became common among non-diseased
mainly as a fashion statement, many people

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.140
also preferred them because of how easy it
is to deal with things like lice when you

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.910
have little to no hair and wear a gigantic
wig.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:46.910
7.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.300
Plate Mail Was Not Impractically Heavy Like
Many People Believe

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.510
A full suit of plate mail was something only
the richer warriors in the middle ages could

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.910
afford, if nothing else because of the incredible
amount of metal required, not to mention the

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.640
intensive labor involved.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.890
For this reason, it has become an iconic part
of the time period and how we view it.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.711
When most people picture a knight they think
of a warrior in full plate mail, and they

00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:13.540
also imagine him to be well protected, but
heavy and cumbersome in battle.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.190
A warrior who is hardly able to move properly,
and relies almost entirely on his advanced

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.610
protection to save the day.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.080
However, the truth is that a full set of plate
mail was hardly all that heavy.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.640
Historians state that it was roughly the same
weight as a firefighter with oxygen gear,

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.560
which is coincidentally about the same amount
of weight most modern soldiers carry into

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.560
battle.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.290
Not only that, but because of how well the
weight was distributed, they think this would

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.470
have made knights in plate armor even lighter,
and still extremely agile.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.120
It’s also been claimed that knights needed
help onto their horses, couldn’t get back

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.570
up if they fell on their backs, and couldn’t
climb ladders in full gear; none of this is

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:49.570
true.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.510
Knights were incredibly fearsome, lightweight,
and agile warriors even donning full metal

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.510
armor.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.510
6.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.100
Medieval Moats Were Absolutely Disgusting
Trenches Of Filth

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.990
When many people think of castles, they also
think of the iconic moats that you see around

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.990
most of them.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.090
In movies the water may look clean, or at
least fairly normal or natural.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.400
Unfortunately, we can assure you that this
was not at all the case.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.910
See, you may have noticed that most historically
known moats weren’t really all that deep

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.840
or all that wide either, which may have made
people wonder why they were considered such

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.460
a useful defense tool.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.810
The reason lies in how a medieval castle’s
plumbing works.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.490
See, inside a castle’s walls all the primitive
restrooms would drain down under the ground

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.910
beneath the keep, and slide into the moat.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.660
In some cases, people would also fling any
extra sewage into the moat if it wasn’t

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.660
going in properly.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.270
What this meant is that moats were a great
defensive barrier because they were absolutely

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.120
disgusting pits filled with the most vile
filth imaginable.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.150
To put it bluntly, falling into a castle moat
would be similar to falling into a modern

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.070
day septic tank.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.880
Considering how limited medicine was at the
time, and how easily you could contract a

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.600
disease falling into a pit like that, it would
almost certainly lead to a horrible death

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.730
within weeks at best.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:59.730
This also means that while used for defense,
it was hardly the primary purpose of a moat.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.460
It certainly doubled nicely as a protective
measure, but it was also an integral part

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.750
of medieval sewage technology.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:06.750
5.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.160
Air Conditioning Is Not A Modern Invention

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.410
While we know that ancient people used various
methods to insulate themselves from the cold,

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.940
and had many methods of warming up, we don’t
really think of them as having a way to really

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:17.940
fight the heat.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.430
For the most part, people from the past are
simply assumed to have toughed it out as best

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:22.430
they could.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.630
However, humans are very ingenious creatures
and considering that they’ve been having

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.660
to deal with the heat for a very long time,
our modern air conditioning turns out to not

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.670
be the first major attempt at cooling.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.771
Now, while some civilizations in the Middle
East built their structures in such a way

00:07:34.771 --> 00:07:39.280
as to properly circulate wind in an attempt
to cool off using architecture, the ancient

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.380
Romans were perfecting air cooling technology
that was largely lost until recent modern

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.380
inventions.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.610
Back in the days of ancient Rome, it’s known
that they possessed an aqueduct system that

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.810
distributed water and removed waste water
very efficiently throughout the city.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.231
It was easily the most advanced plumbing system
anywhere in the world, and we wouldn’t see

00:07:56.231 --> 00:07:59.100
anything like it for a very long time either
once Rome had fallen.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.170
Some emperors like Elagabalus took things
a step further than most would and had huge

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:07.330
mountains of snow imported in for cooling,
but regular Romans had come up with ingenious

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:12.580
ways of using the aqueduct system to circulate
cool water through the walls of their house.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.240
This allowed a very advanced system of air
cooling that would likely have also required

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.340
a lot less power and upkeep than ours need
today.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.340
4.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:24.020
The Holy Grail Originated From Ancient Celtic
Legends And Not The Bible

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.660
Everyone has heard of the legend of the Holy
Grail, the alleged cup that caught the blood

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.950
of Jesus Christ and was passed down from Joseph
of Arimathea to various different groups or

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.590
protectors, depending on who you ask.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.321
The story has featured heavily in Arthurian
myth, where the king is obsessed with the

00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:37.680
finding of the Grail itself.

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.390
Most of these stories attribute incredible
power or knowledge to whoever possesses the

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:44.960
grail, and many groups have been said to search
for it throughout history in the hopes of

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.180
enriching their existence.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.500
We all know these stories well, but what many
people don’t realize is that the Arthurian

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.830
legend most people know of is not based on
biblical legend, but actually on old Celtic

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.920
Pagan myths about a cauldron of the Gods.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.660
It all started in Celtic legends about their
Gods known as the Dagda.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.950
These Gods leave a cauldron on earth that
many men seek, and is known to heal wounds,

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.300
and grant great power and riches to those
who find it.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.950
Historians have explained that the Arthurian
stories are basically a retelling of the story

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:18.370
of a Celtic God King called Gwydion, who had
very similar adventures to Arthur in pursuit

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:21.150
of a Cauldron with almost the same attributes.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:25.240
While this may be surprising to some, it was
also not uncommon for one religion to rewrite

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.980
some of another’s tales when they came to
prominence over the other faith.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.590
It would certainly not be the last time religions
have repurposed historical myths for their

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.590
own.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:35.590
3.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:38.500
Modern Birthstone Legends Are Likely Little
More Than A Marketing Ploy

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.370
You may have noticed that birthstone lists
on jewelry websites seem to hardly ever be

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:43.500
consistent.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.520
There are some gems like diamond or amethyst
that seem to stay the same, but others seem

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.111
to differ wildly based on the jeweler.

00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:54.690
Not to mention the countless sites that ascribe
various mythological powers to each stone,

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:59.500
most with very dubious sources in terms of
where they got their historical information.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.330
This means that in general, there is a lot
of misunderstanding about birthstones and

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.850
where they actually came from.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:08.350
Many people know that they have an ancient
origin, but aren’t aware of the details

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:12.590
of it – nor are they aware that most common
birthstones were decided upon by jewelers

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.020
as a marketing ploy.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:18.190
Back in 1912 a bunch of American jewelers
got together and came up with a quasi-official

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:22.080
list, that still isn’t often followed by
some sellers if it doesn’t fit their inventory.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.920
This list has been criticized by some for
being designed mainly to sell as many shiny

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.390
stones as possible, regardless of historical
veracity.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:32.880
The reason many people are disappointed with
how jewelers went about this, is because the

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.950
historical origins are being completely ignored.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:40.441
The very start of the birthstone stories began
with a Jewish historian named Josephus, who

00:10:40.441 --> 00:10:44.630
believed that the breastplate of Aaron – a
treasured armor plate from the bible with

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:49.010
12 sacred gems set in it – was connected
to the 12 months of the year and to the signs

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:50.010
of the zodiac.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:54.220
However, to add to the confusion, the writings
of Josephus themselves have two separate and

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.590
contradictory lists.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.790
Also, in modern birthstone lore people are
expected to buy one for their birth month

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.490
and wear it most of the year.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:06.250
However, when superstitions regarding birthstones
first began among early Christians, the fashion

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:09.610
was to wear the appropriate stone for the
appropriate month that you were currently

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.120
in, not just wear the one from your birth
month all the time.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.120
2.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.420
Globally And Regionally Organized Time Is
A Recent Invention

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.480
Many people tend to take time for granted,
but they forget that it’s an entirely invented

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:26.110
construct designed to organize meeting places
and make sense of our surroundings.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:30.350
Or to put it simply, time is relative to the
place that we are right now, and the point

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.030
of reference we’re using.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:36.060
While this may seem a strange way to mention
time today, what with organized time zones

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:40.300
throughout the world that work like clockwork
(uh, no pun intended), the truth is that not

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:45.350
even 200 years ago, even entire countries
didn’t operate on the kind of standard,

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.320
organized time system we have now.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.760
Even as recently as the mid 1800s many towns
simply had their own timepiece that used the

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.860
sun as a local reference for what time it
was.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:58.490
This was simple and made perfect sense for
the time period, as high speed travel and

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:01.630
communication was not really particularly
in use.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:05.640
However, as train tracks started to expand
throughout the country, it began to become

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.340
imperative that there was a set standard for
time.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.660
Without time being properly organized, trains
would have a good chance of slamming right

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:16.510
into each other, and there were in fact some
avoidable train crashes before standard time

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.640
was implemented.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:21.330
While early attempts at standardizing time
and adding time zones had been attempted before,

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:26.500
it was the dangers of the new railway system
and the precision needed that finally created

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:30.900
the catalyst necessary for it to become encoded
into law in 1883.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:35.430
What this means is that not even 200 years
ago, time was completely local and thoroughly

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:36.820
disorganized throughout the world.

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.460
It’s hard to even begin to imagine just
how different having standard time has made

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.460
everything.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.460
1.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.680
The History Of Cars Goes Back Much Further
Than Most People Realize

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.930
Most people think that the first cars were
created in the early 1900s when Henry Ford’s

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:51.940
experiments in gasoline-based engines began
to pay off.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:56.050
As we all know, he started a motor company
and perfected an assembly line process that

00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:01.180
quickly pumped out massive amounts of cars,
and changed the face of the world forever.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:05.720
Before long, using animals to pull your transportation
was a thing of the past, and burning fossil

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.470
fuels became the new thing.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:10.650
However, what many people don’t realize
is that the reason cars’ popularity is so

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:15.480
recent is not because an automobile is a new
idea, but because Ford was the first to perfect

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:20.050
it in a way that made it appealing and somewhat
practical to use – as well as the first

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:23.310
person to find a way to easily mass produce
said process.

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:26.510
People had been experimenting with vehicles
that could move without an animal’s help

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:27.820
going back hundreds of years.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:32.310
Back in the 1600s a skilled inventor named
Ferdinand Verbiest built a self-propelled

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:35.340
steam vehicle as a toy for the then-Emperor
of China.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:39.800
This vehicle, however, was likely not large
enough to hold or propel a person even when

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.650
it was actually built, and was little more
than a novelty.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:47.260
However, in the 1700s, a French inventor named
Nicholas Joseph Cugnot invented something

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.790
that could actually be described as the world’s
first truly self-powered vehicle capable of

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:52.890
carrying people.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:57.890
It was an absolute monstrosity of a steam
powered creation that weighed roughly 2.5

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:02.410
tons, was a whale to steer, and could reach
a speed of roughly five miles per hour at

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:03.500
the best of times.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:08.060
Due to these limitations and the amount of
energy required it just wasn’t seen as that

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:13.320
practical or impressive, and people kept using
animals to haul goods until Ford came along

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:26.800
with a much improved version.
