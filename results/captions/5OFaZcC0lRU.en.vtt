00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.920
What's very comfortable now may not be so
comfortable later on.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.470
That's when I might have to take out my mutual
funds.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.700
My only worry is my dad works for the state
of Illinois.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.930
The state's pretty much insolvent.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.890
And even his health care, which is through
the state of Illinois, it could take up to

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.740
a year for him to get reimbursed for things
like that, so that is worrisome.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:41.640
Justine Underhill: Retirement is all some
people ever think about, especially the 50-million-plus

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.620
Americans set to retire in the next few years.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.790
They obsess over it, like my dad did.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.790
It's what they worked for.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:49.840
It's their dreams.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.789
But those dreams could be shattered.

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.859
You're about to hear Real Vision's founder
and CEO, Raoul Pal, explore why we're heading

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:02.379
into a retirement crisis in America and around
the world as many people take on more risk

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:03.469
than they understand.

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.240
I was curious to see if anyone was thinking
about this, so we spoke with people in New

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.920
York and heard the same story over and over--
people pushing off retirement, people not

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.380
having enough savings, people relying on government
pensions.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.900
Here's some of what they said.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.900
No.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.830
No way I could have saved enough for retirement.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.270
I mean, I have enough to retire, let's say,
if I want to go to Wyoming or something like

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.270
that.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.000
I saved enough for at least the next 10 years.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.299
Who knows with inflation what will happen,
but I feel the next 10 years, I'm OK.

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.880
If the United States government goes out of
business, then my pension won't be there.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.540
These stories were just a small sample of
what we heard.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.009
And this is not just something that those
actively looking for retirement are going

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.009
to face.

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.689
It's something that's going to have a big
impact on my generation as well, whether it's

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.619
figuring out pensions, or social security,
or potentially supporting our own parents'.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.760
Retirement is part of the promise of life
in the developed world.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.020
And if that promise isn't met, it's really
going to affect everyone, whether you're hoping

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.580
to retire in 5 years or 50.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:18.870
Roaul Pal: My name's Raoul Pal.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.840
I'm the CEO and co-founder of Real Vision.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.340
But today, I'm talking on behalf of Global
Macro Investor, my research business.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.730
I want to talk about what I think is the biggest,
single theme of our generation.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.109
And I think it's the most important thing
that anybody can understand.

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.880
And it's all about the pension crisis.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.250
You see, demographics is the big story of
our time.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.220
And it's all about the story of the baby boomer
generation.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.180
This was the largest generation of people
the world had ever known in the richest countries

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.970
in across the globe.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:05.990
Now, that generation drove all of the macroeconomic
forces that we come to recognize as normal.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.930
When they first came into the labor force
back in the 1970s when they 20 or so years

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.760
old, what they did was they bid up the demand
for goods.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.930
Because if you think about it, a record number
of people came in to buy their first suits,

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.799
their first house, their first car, their
first table, their first chair.

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.350
Everything was new.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.910
That demand created an enormous problem for
the world to deal with, and it created the

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.600
inflationary environment of the '80s.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.959
Yes, there were monetary reasons behind that
as well.

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.210
But really, a lot of it was driven by demographics.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:47.780
Now, as that generation moved through their
lifetimes, they had a particular set of behavior

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.690
patterns that affected the financial world
particularly.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:58.370
The main one is the fact that after the second
World War, that young generation decided they

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.340
didn't want to be their parents, as almost
everybody does.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.959
And they said, we don't want to be austere.

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.350
Their parents had lived through two world
wars.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.720
What they wanted to do was spend.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.560
They wanted to be free of the shackles of
the things that their parents had had in the

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.120
past.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.430
So what happened was Wall Street, being clever
as ever, came up with this genius idea.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.780
It was the pension plan.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.990
Now, pension plans had existed for a long
time before.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.180
But really, this is where the pension plan
became everything.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.520
Wall Street fed them a story.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.400
The story was simple.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.950
You don't need to save as much money as your
parents.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.720
You don't need to spend or save 20% of your
income.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.970
What you need to do is give it to us.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.010
We're the smart guys, and we'll turn into
more money.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.820
And that means you'll have more money to spend.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.510
So that started the largest stock market boom
in all of recorded history.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:02.170
Now, the other thing that happened is as consumption
became a larger part of the economy-- and

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:07.720
that was driven by government policy as well--
is the baby boomers were offered another piece

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.830
of magic from Wall Street.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.410
They were offered credit.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.500
So in the '80s, Ronald Reagan and Margaret
Thatcher basically allowed credit to be available

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.500
to everybody.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.680
So suddenly, the credit boom took off.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.380
So there we have two monetary booms happening
at the same time.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.770
The baby boomers have stopped saving, have
given a little bit of money from their 401(k)s

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.220
to Wall Street that starts accumulating quickly.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:39.930
Their income has also then gone into credit,
the servicing of credit to buy more and more

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.300
goods.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.150
That trend continued for a long time.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.400
The trend of consumption within the US economy
continues to this day.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.810
It's massively outsized because of this credit
boom.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.740
That meant that Wall Street became outsized
too.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.520
It was taking the money from the pension system,
and investing that-- or speculating with it--

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.380
and also making money from the credit side.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:09.280
Now, that all ended in a complete blow up
that happened in 2008.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.380
But why did 2000 happen?

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.920
Well, interestingly enough, that's when the
first baby boomers started retiring.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.620
When they started retiring, suddenly there
were some sellers of stocks.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:26.380
Before that, everybody had been buying stocks
every single month in their 401(k).

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.900
Buying-the-dip mentality became the key thing
for the world.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.430
But the problem is now we're facing the demographic
time bomb.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.800
I remember when I was back at Goldman Sachs
in the late '90s.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.050
Some of my colleagues wrote an article called
"The Demographic Time Bomb."

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:50.900
And that was about the issues the world will
face in the future as retirees start retiring

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:56.460
and whether the state sector could afford
all of the draw on the capital.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.210
Now I'm not going to talk about the state
sector in this particular presentation.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:05.940
We all know the story that there's too few
millennials and younger people paying into

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.270
the system to pay for these retirees.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.920
The maths don't add up, so the entitlements
can explode.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.980
And these numbers can be in the hundreds of
trillions of dollars.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.790
But I don't want to talk about that.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:22.590
I also don't want to talk about the defined
benefit pension system.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.160
That's another big story that I think many
of you are aware of.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.820
We've seen it all across America and all across
Europe into the UK where defined benefit pension

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:37.889
schemes will never be able to afford to pay
out the promises that they had to the retirees.

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:44.190
You see, the returns in financial markets
weren't quite as good as the snake oil salesman

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.030
on Wall Street told everybody.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.030
And that was a problem.

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:48.760
It's kind of like a Ponzi scheme.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.230
The first people to get out made all the returns.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.850
The last people to get out get nothing.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.450
And that's the real issue.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:08:01.990
The real issue is all of this is coming to
a head because everybody is about to retire.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:06.780
If you look at the chart of the baby boomers
reaching retirement age, you can see it's

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.540
a demographic wall.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:14.310
Currently we're retiring at about 3.9 million
in America alone, baby boomers.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:20.330
And it goes up in a straight line all the
way through to 2027.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.980
What we've got is more and more people, every
year, retiring.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:30.550
That is an extraordinary state of affairs
because retirees have a different behavior

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.510
pattern than the average person.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.860
You can see the chart in a different way here.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:41.500
You can see that the average retirement age
is currently around 64 in America.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:46.800
And this year, 2018, the average baby boomer
is 64.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:52.580
It's telling us the average person is destined
to retire this year.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:57.360
But the real question is here-- who can afford
to retire?

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:04.920
You see, if we look at the retirement age
of Americans, the actual retirement age is

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.590
going up.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:11.820
And those who haven't retired, they're deciding
that they're going to have to work longer

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:12.820
too.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:17.900
You see, the real issue here is that people
can't afford to retire.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:22.640
So they're having to extend retirement-- either
expected or current retirement dates-- out

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.210
into the future.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:28.390
It's this problem of not being able to afford
retirement that is creating the problems we've

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:29.390
got today.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:33.230
The other way you can look at this is when
we look at the labor force participation rate

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.480
of the people above 65 years old.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.850
Oddly, the 65-year-olds have been coming back
into the labor force at a record rate.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:45.020
They're competing for jobs with millennials
and others.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.250
This is an odd states of affairs.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:53.040
And, again, is driven by the issue of these
baby boomers having far too much debt to retire

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.610
and not enough savings.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.020
So let's drill down to the numbers.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:10:00.170
It's really important to understand the numbers
behind what I'm talking about.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.029
So let's dig into the stats.

00:10:02.029 --> 00:10:06.370
See, the US average pension benefits are $23,000
a year.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:13.960
But there's a bit of an issue because disposable
income per capita is $44,000 a year.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:19.320
Now, the ideal retirement income that these
people want obviously matches their disposable

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:24.149
income, which is about $44,000 to $45,000
a year.

00:10:24.149 --> 00:10:29.670
But really, when you impute from their savings,
what they really get is another $9,000.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:39.690
So their total benefits are about $31,000
versus their needs of about $45,000.

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.610
This is a huge problem.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:45.899
There's a 30% shortfall in their savings.

00:10:45.899 --> 00:10:48.360
And that has to come out of consumption.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.880
I think many of you have seen this before.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.279
It's the household net worth, the average
net worth of the American household.

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:57.100
And it looks pretty good, right?

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.100
They've got $24,000 in bonds.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.880
Americans don't seem to like bonds, and that's
something I'll talk about in a bit.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:10.690
They've got $269,000 of equities, $300,000
of real estate, savings of $107,000, pension

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:16.330
fund assets of $264,000, and other savings
and assets of about $120,000.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:21.540
Now, that's a pretty healthy million dollar
balance sheet, so what's the problem?

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.480
The problem is it's massively skewed by the
1%.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:30.500
That 1% that we hear about versus the 99%,
well, they've got all the assets and all the

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.500
savings.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:38.710
When you strip out the data for the 1% and
calculate the median net worth, it's an entirely

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.130
different game.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:46.050
The median net worth offers something that
I think is terrifying and sad.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.550
The average person has $4,000 in their bonds.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:56.839
They have $45,000 in equities, $53,000 in
real estate, which is extraordinary, right?

00:11:56.839 --> 00:12:03.890
That is all they have after their mortgage
is $53,000 for a lifetime worth of household

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:04.890
investment.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:12.750
They have savings of $18,000, pension fund
assets of $44,000, and other assets of $20,000.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:21.180
You see, the problem is these people are benefiting
from one of the biggest shifts the world has

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.730
ever seen-- life expectancy.

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:30.300
Life expectancy, although it dropped a couple
of years running recently in the US, is rising.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:37.430
So life expectancy in America, and across
the world, is in an exponential trend higher.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.600
It is going higher and higher every single
year.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:45.540
Obviously, the last couple of years were the
opiate epidemic saw a bit of a pullback.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:49.910
But generally, the average American doesn't
know how long they're going to live for.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:52.000
It's going to be longer than they thought.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.340
You see, not knowing how long you're going
to live for changes your behavior pattern.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:03.149
It means that you start pushing out your retirement
date because you don't have enough money to

00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:04.339
retire.

00:13:04.339 --> 00:13:08.910
Because if you've moved your life expectancy
on 5 years, well then you need a lot more

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:09.930
money.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:14.980
In a low-interest-rate environment, it becomes
almost impossible to generate the income,

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.770
so you're drawing down on capital very, very
rapidly.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:21.950
So let's look at this balance sheet to see
where the capital really is.

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:28.640
Now, what have to understand is US households
have really taken on board the fact that they're

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.230
going to live longer, and they don't have
enough savings.

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:36.020
Because after 2000 and 2008, the world hasn't
generated enough returns.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:41.220
So what they've done is taken the most amount
of risk possible.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:47.279
Normally, if you're about to retire, you should
be increasing your fixed income allocation

00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:50.000
to guarantee your future retirement income.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.170
However, behaviorally speaking, if you don't
have a high enough income to retire on, you

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.459
have a kind of shit-or- bust scenario.

00:13:58.459 --> 00:14:00.940
What you have to do is take that risk.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:07.890
That risk, for American, is buying real estate,
and they did that in droves back in the 2000s.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:13.540
Now, they got burned in that, and they don't
have much net worth left in that any longer.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:17.620
So the real driver of net worth has been the
equity market.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:23.339
The equity market is the only driver of net
worth going forwards, and this has meant that

00:14:23.339 --> 00:14:26.480
people have doubled up their bets and tripled
up their bets.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:32.240
They have this bet directly in equities, and
they have this bet in their pension plans.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.910
The pension plans themselves have record holding
of equities versus fixed income.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:40.830
They also have record risk in terms of credit.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:45.940
Private equity, venture capital, hedge funds,
they all have equity-like returns.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.630
They're risk-seeking investments.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:51.250
And they're doing this because nobody can
fund their retirement.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.530
It's the same story at government level.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:57.420
It's the same story at defined benefit pension
level.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:01.300
And it's the same story for households and
their 401(k)s.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:06.760
Corporate pension plans, they're all the same--
nobody has enough money to fund retirements.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:10.899
So everybody is taking the maximum risk.

00:15:10.899 --> 00:15:16.160
Now, in a rising equity market, this kind
of makes sense.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.649
You're clawing back some of the ability to
retire.

00:15:19.649 --> 00:15:23.490
But if things change, the picture gets a little
bit worse.

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:29.850
You see, the one bet people are taking is
they're actually putting the maximum allocation

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:37.120
in all of recorded history, across the entire
system, into risk- seeking, equity-like assets

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.110
when equity valuations are off the charts.

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:45.990
You see, when we look at the chart of the
median price revenue of the S&amp;P 500, we can

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:49.870
see it's at all time, ridiculous, record highs.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.080
We could use any measure.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.620
I just used this chart because it's the most
dramatic.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.180
But we can use the P-ratio.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:58.030
It'll be the second most overvalued market
in history.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.820
The median P will be the most overvalued in
history.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.450
Market cap to GDP, the most overvalued in
history.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:07.680
We have an extraordinarily overvalued market.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:14.829
Now what's the worst thing about this is that
there is a record over weight of equities.

00:16:14.829 --> 00:16:20.910
Nobody has owned this many equities or equity-like
instruments-- risk- seeking instruments--

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:24.800
ever before when the valuation is so high.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.769
That is a dangerous setup.

00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:37.050
You see, the real problem here is it's all
about the business cycle.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:40.110
The business cycle, as you know, ebbs and
flows.

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:41.899
You can see it on the chart here.

00:16:41.899 --> 00:16:47.020
It goes up and down, and it's relatively predictable--
within some boundaries.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:54.200
But what happens is a peaking, booming economy
eventually gives way to a recession.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.990
And they come along periodically-- every 4
to 8 years.

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:03.990
Now what's interesting about this expansion
is this is the second-equal, longest expansion

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.649
in all economic history.

00:17:06.649 --> 00:17:11.089
And by next month or the month after, this
will be the second longest outright.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:18.069
So what that tells you is there is a probability
that this expansion has to end at some point.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:20.989
Could it roll on for another couple of years,
2 or 3 years?

00:17:20.989 --> 00:17:22.069
Of course it could.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:24.980
Could this end up being the longest ever expansion?

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.240
Of course it can.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:33.080
The point being is the clock is ticking, and
it's moving towards the next recession.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.529
Now, normally, that's no big deal.

00:17:36.529 --> 00:17:38.880
But this time, it's a bit different.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.580
You see, in recessions, the stock market generally
crashes.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.029
That's normal.

00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:45.450
Companies earn less money.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.429
Investors fear worse outcomes than are expected.

00:17:48.429 --> 00:17:50.570
And the market sells off massively.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:54.309
And over time, it has had a tendency to recover.

00:17:54.309 --> 00:17:57.710
Well, again, that's a bit of a recency bias.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:02.659
Because all across Europe and other markets
around the world, things never did recover.

00:18:02.659 --> 00:18:06.309
And why didn't they recover versus America?

00:18:06.309 --> 00:18:11.669
And that's because the Americans have a cult
of equity, and the Europeans tend to have

00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:13.190
a cult of bonds.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:16.659
So Europeans basically gave up on the equity
market.

00:18:16.659 --> 00:18:21.120
The structure of the pension system there
means that they own much less equities.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:26.629
They're about 70% or 80% in bonds for this
particular cohort.

00:18:26.629 --> 00:18:28.070
The Americans are the opposite.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:31.570
They're about 70% in equity and equity-like
instruments.

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:34.549
They're taking huge amounts of risk.

00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:41.169
Now, normally, in America with this risk seeking
culture, once the equity market falls, the

00:18:41.169 --> 00:18:46.919
401(k) payments come in as everybody's income
starts filtering into the stock market and

00:18:46.919 --> 00:18:50.350
acts as a break and helps the market rise.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:56.769
The problem is the next recession is going
to cross the exact point that the maximum

00:18:56.769 --> 00:18:57.769
num ou see, the real problem here is it’s
all about the business cycle.

00:18:57.769 --> 00:18:59.679
The business cycle, as you know, ebbsber of
people are going into retirement.

00:18:59.679 --> 00:19:02.559
This has never happened before anywhere.

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:08.639
What it means is that all of the life savings
that are in equities, which is basically 70%

00:19:08.639 --> 00:19:14.769
of the entire household balance sheet is going
to get wiped out in one recession.

00:19:14.769 --> 00:19:18.950
And they won't be able to buy back because
they won't have an income to buy back.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:24.909
This is the biggest problem I can see in the
world today, and nobody really understands

00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:29.759
that juxtaposition between the business cycle,
risk taking, and demographics.

00:19:29.759 --> 00:19:35.240
It's this Nexus that makes me so concerned
about what is going to happen to this baby

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:40.289
boom generation unless somebody tells them
about the risks that they're taking.

00:19:40.289 --> 00:19:42.400
Wall Street doesn't want to tell them.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.999
The asset management firms don't want to tell
them.

00:19:44.999 --> 00:19:49.710
The TV companies don't want to tell them because
everybody's cashing in on the same boom.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:55.090
Just look at the amount of advertising based
around asset management and this industry.

00:19:55.090 --> 00:20:00.049
It's terrifying to be pushing people in at
this peak.

00:20:00.049 --> 00:20:02.179
It's OK to trade and invest.

00:20:02.179 --> 00:20:06.629
But if you are of retirement age, you should
be cautious.

00:20:06.629 --> 00:20:10.690
If you're a millennial, you should be the
opposite of cautious.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:12.909
You should be waiting for this opportunity.

00:20:12.909 --> 00:20:17.859
So there's behavioral mindset that needs to
take place, but there's more to this.

00:20:17.859 --> 00:20:23.640
You see, demographics also tell us where the
economy is going to go in the future.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:28.960
And the reason being is that a number of things
are correlated to demographics because people

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.299
of a certain age generally act in a certain
way.

00:20:32.299 --> 00:20:36.330
That's not to say all generations and all
the age groups act the same.

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:41.989
But overall, a retiree will spend a lot less
than somebody who is in the peak of their

00:20:41.989 --> 00:20:42.989
earning career.

00:20:42.989 --> 00:20:46.009
I always use the example of my father.

00:20:46.009 --> 00:20:51.230
When my father retired at 60 years old, he
was the kind of guy where we were lucky enough

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:54.889
to buy a new car every 3 years, and it was
a fancy German car.

00:20:54.889 --> 00:20:58.809
And he'd have nice wine in the house and go
out for dinners all the time.

00:20:58.809 --> 00:21:03.309
Cut forward to retirement, suddenly he had
his fixed investment pull.

00:21:03.309 --> 00:21:04.309
That's what he had to live off.

00:21:04.309 --> 00:21:07.889
He didn't know how long he was going to live
for, and he didn't know what the cost of living

00:21:07.889 --> 00:21:09.289
was going to be.

00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:10.289
So what does he do?

00:21:10.289 --> 00:21:12.580
Pull on the handbrake on his spending.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:19.479
Cut forward 5, 6 years, suddenly, I would
say he's spending 60% less than he used to

00:21:19.479 --> 00:21:21.429
spend in a year.

00:21:21.429 --> 00:21:27.119
Now when you multiply that out across the
entire baby boom population, you've got a

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:30.580
dramatic economic event, and there's no getting
around that.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.009
This is kind of baked in the cake.

00:21:32.009 --> 00:21:37.389
Let me show you some charts about how demographics
tie into the economy.

00:21:37.389 --> 00:21:41.909
The first chart is the unemployment rate versus
the labor force participation rate.

00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:46.749
Now the labor force participation rate is
key because it's really how many people are

00:21:46.749 --> 00:21:49.999
earning in the labor force to drive the economy.

00:21:49.999 --> 00:21:52.639
Now what's interesting is people have said,
oh, look at this.

00:21:52.639 --> 00:21:53.639
It's amazing.

00:21:53.639 --> 00:21:56.679
The US economy is generating so many jobs.

00:21:56.679 --> 00:21:57.980
Well, it's kind of odd.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:02.200
The unemployment rate is low, but the economy
has not generated anything near the number

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.369
of jobs that it has done in previous cycles.

00:22:05.369 --> 00:22:06.820
Why is that?

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.850
It's because people are opting out of the
labor force.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:15.059
So it's naturally driving down the unemployment
rate because the labor pool is shrinking.

00:22:15.059 --> 00:22:17.799
So it's a bit of an old indicator.

00:22:17.799 --> 00:22:23.570
This is exactly the reason why the Japanese
have had an incredibly low unemployment rate

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:29.870
over the entire time of their lackluster,
post-demographic, crash economy.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:35.080
It's one of the reasons why the European unemployment
rate has come back sharply.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:39.269
It's because of the fact that people opt out
of the labor force.

00:22:39.269 --> 00:22:44.980
Now in America, it means that we should expect
the labor force unemployment rate to fall

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.230
and fall.

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:50.109
Now that's interesting, and many people say
that's inflationary.

00:22:50.109 --> 00:22:54.539
But it's not because of the number of people
competing for those jobs or deciding to opt

00:22:54.539 --> 00:22:55.539
out.

00:22:55.539 --> 00:22:57.629
Anyway, let's look at some more charts to
build more of a picture.

00:22:57.629 --> 00:23:02.820
As I talked about, the thing I really fear
the most in this whole equation is what happens

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.039
to spending rates.

00:23:04.039 --> 00:23:09.779
You see, the spending rate, the personal consumption
rate, basically follows your age group.

00:23:09.779 --> 00:23:11.600
You spend in a predictable pattern.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.600
Yes, I know.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.600
We all think we're individuals.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.600
But we're actually not.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.830
We all basically do the same thing as people
of our age, give or take the parameters of

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:22.240
which we earn and some of the other behavioral
aspects.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.029
But really speaking, consumption is based
on age.

00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:29.770
And what happens is the older we get, the
less we begin to consume.

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:35.159
That kind of makes sense because you bought
most of the things you need.

00:23:35.159 --> 00:23:40.359
You tend to buy larger, big-ticket items--
holidays, cars-- when you're older if you've

00:23:40.359 --> 00:23:42.409
still got that kind of income before you retire.

00:23:42.409 --> 00:23:46.720
You see, if you're a bit younger in peak earning,
you tend to buy more things for your house.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:51.190
You know, you might buy yourself better bed
coverings, or a new bed, or go to IKEA a bit

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:52.190
more often.

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:53.600
You tend to buy yourself a few more luxuries.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.529
You tend to spend a bit more in the supermarket.

00:23:56.529 --> 00:23:57.639
And that's normal.

00:23:57.639 --> 00:24:00.039
Everybody does the same thing because you're
at peak spending.

00:24:00.039 --> 00:24:03.109
But when you get older, you tend to buy less
of those things.

00:24:03.109 --> 00:24:05.889
You tend to buy more big-ticket items.

00:24:05.889 --> 00:24:08.320
You might buy a nice car.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.120
You might buy a nice holiday.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.489
But you've got most of the things you actually
need.

00:24:12.489 --> 00:24:20.379
You've accumulated them across your lifetime,
and your consumption goes down.

00:24:20.379 --> 00:24:25.690
Another fascinating chart is you can see gasoline
retail sales also exactly mirror the labor

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:27.690
force participation rate.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:29.480
Now why the hell is that?

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:33.970
Because basically the older you get, the less
you consume gasoline.

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:34.980
You drive less.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.859
Again, I can use my parents for that.

00:24:36.859 --> 00:24:38.710
They used to drive everywhere.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:42.679
They live in Spain, and they would drive across
the country to go and see the place.

00:24:42.679 --> 00:24:46.039
But the older they got, the smaller their
circle got.

00:24:46.039 --> 00:24:50.679
And now, basically, they go to the local supermarket,
to the local bar, to the local restaurant.

00:24:50.679 --> 00:24:52.320
So their mileage goes down.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.029
They just consume less gas.

00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:56.399
They're not running around as much.

00:24:56.399 --> 00:25:01.169
So interesting enough, the whole of the petrochemical
complex is tied to demographics.

00:25:01.169 --> 00:25:03.610
I bet you didn't know that.

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:05.639
Also, monetarist talk about the velocity of
money.

00:25:05.639 --> 00:25:10.840
And it's a key indicator for inflation.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:14.250
If money is moving around the system, it tends
to be more inflationary.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:18.820
It kind of gets around the system a lot more
and creates inflation.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:23.570
Now the problem is velocity of money is essentially
a demographic phenomenon.

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:28.149
The older people get the more they save and
the less they spend, and the money doesn't

00:25:28.149 --> 00:25:29.289
go around the system.

00:25:29.289 --> 00:25:31.289
They're not reinvesting in things.

00:25:31.289 --> 00:25:33.049
They're not spending as much.

00:25:33.049 --> 00:25:36.289
And like consumption, it tends to fall over
time.

00:25:36.289 --> 00:25:39.979
So they're basically a function of each other,
and I think that's really important.

00:25:39.979 --> 00:25:42.529
You can throw in the low interest rates into
this.

00:25:42.529 --> 00:25:47.859
They're all interconnected and tend to drag
down velocity of money, tend to drag down

00:25:47.859 --> 00:25:51.769
the labor force participation rate, tend to
drag down consumption.

00:25:51.769 --> 00:25:54.820
Now I want to give you something new to think
about.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:59.919
Most people think about the Fed as this desperate
attempt to keep the system as is and not let

00:25:59.919 --> 00:26:04.239
the banks go under, and they didn't really
understand why they were doing what they did.

00:26:04.239 --> 00:26:09.960
Now what happens if you look at the Fed balance
sheet through the prism of demographics and

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.059
it becomes entirely different?

00:26:12.059 --> 00:26:18.409
Basically, the balance sheet almost exactly
mirrors the labor force participation rate.

00:26:18.409 --> 00:26:24.940
The Fed is taking the slack for the retirees
and people leaving the labor force.

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.059
This is all they're doing.

00:26:26.059 --> 00:26:27.980
They're trying to offset this.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:33.460
Now, whether they are cognisant of doing this
or not, this is essentially what they're doing.

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:36.539
It's so fascinating, and it makes total sense
to me.

00:26:36.539 --> 00:26:42.659
What I love about demographics is you can
essentially extrapolate forward the demographics

00:26:42.659 --> 00:26:45.749
of a nation because it's baked in the cake.

00:26:45.749 --> 00:26:49.470
When those people are born, you kind of know
when they're going to die, roughly what they're

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:52.639
going to do, and how they're going operate
within the economy.

00:26:52.639 --> 00:27:00.890
So Remi Teuto and myself, Global Macro Investor,
put together a composite index of how are

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:06.509
we to construct a participation rate using
a number of different statistics.

00:27:06.509 --> 00:27:11.489
Now what's interesting is it mirrors the data
pretty cleanly, so it us a good idea of where

00:27:11.489 --> 00:27:13.600
we think this is going.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:20.359
And then we can look forward and see where
it goes, and this is where things get ugly.

00:27:20.359 --> 00:27:28.440
You see, because of the demographics, the
labor force participation rate is about to

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.419
fall off a cliff.

00:27:30.419 --> 00:27:38.820
Yes, there's a bit of wiggle, but 2018, 2019
is we should see a collapse in labor force

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:39.820
participation.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:41.749
Now, obviously, that kind of makes sense.

00:27:41.749 --> 00:27:46.029
I've told you that we're hitting that point
where the retirement age and the average age

00:27:46.029 --> 00:27:47.580
of Americans are crossing.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:50.429
So they're going to start this wall of retirement.

00:27:50.429 --> 00:27:55.120
Now that means that people are coming out
of the labor force, and that has some big

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.559
knock-on effects that you need to be aware
of.

00:27:57.559 --> 00:28:03.650
Now armed with our future labor force participation
rate, we can look where the Fed balance sheet

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:04.650
is going to go.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:06.919
The Fed balance sheet here is inverted.

00:28:06.919 --> 00:28:10.299
It's saying it's going to go to $8 trillion
dollars.

00:28:10.299 --> 00:28:13.760
What's interesting is, again, how great this
fit is.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.450
And think of the prism I talked about of the
business cycle.

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:19.289
At some point soon, we're going to have a
recession.

00:28:19.289 --> 00:28:22.929
And soon meaning 1, 2, 3 years.

00:28:22.929 --> 00:28:27.830
Now what we know in the recession is we have
no other outcomes except the Fed expanding

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:29.240
their balance sheet.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.799
We've not come up with another way of dealing
with this yet.

00:28:31.799 --> 00:28:33.210
Yes, there's going to be fiscal stuff.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.330
Yes, there's going to be other untried measures.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:38.619
But the Fed are going to expand, whether we
like it or not.

00:28:38.619 --> 00:28:43.679
So this will lead us to expect a massive expansion
in the balance sheet to come to offset this

00:28:43.679 --> 00:28:45.349
wave of retirees.

00:28:45.349 --> 00:28:49.649
Again, what's interesting is a bit of economic
history because Japan has an older population

00:28:49.649 --> 00:28:50.729
by 10 years.

00:28:50.729 --> 00:28:57.450
So if we look at the BOJ balance sheet and
look at the Fed balance sheet now as a percentage

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:01.940
of GDP and put them against each other, it's
very clear where this is going to go.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:07.179
It's telling us we're going to see an absolute
explosion of the balance sheet as a percentage

00:29:07.179 --> 00:29:08.749
of GDP over time.

00:29:08.749 --> 00:29:11.220
Now I'm not going to get into the ramifications
of that.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.580
It's something we've discussed on Real Vision
a lot.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.999
We kind of know it's coming, and there's a
number of ways it will get dealt with.

00:29:16.999 --> 00:29:22.710
But the point being is that demographics are
pretty much dyed in the wool right now.

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:26.850
And if they're dyed in the wool, then we know
where personal consumption is going.

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:32.769
Personal consumption is going to unwind the
great boom of the last 30 or 40 years where

00:29:32.769 --> 00:29:37.610
consumption became over 75% of the US economy.

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:41.929
Consumption is going to shrink as a percentage
of the economy, and consumption itself is

00:29:41.929 --> 00:29:43.490
going to go negative.

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:46.770
Now that is something nobody is set up to
understand.

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:52.419
Can you imagine a world where consumption
is the net takeaway from the economy and not

00:29:52.419 --> 00:29:53.700
the driver?

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.210
That's what we're setting up for.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.519
This is something truly extraordinary.

00:29:57.519 --> 00:30:00.809
Now, again, go back to the big cycle.

00:30:00.809 --> 00:30:05.090
To drive consumption further, you're going
to have to ram the millennial generation with

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:09.690
enormous amounts of debt to drive consumption
and offset some of this.

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:11.389
But they don't want to do that.

00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:14.379
They're already saddled with debt from their
education.

00:30:14.379 --> 00:30:17.849
So they don't have the ability to do anything
about this.

00:30:17.849 --> 00:30:18.919
They also don't earn enough.

00:30:18.919 --> 00:30:22.379
They're not offsetting the same amount of
wealth as their parents.

00:30:22.379 --> 00:30:27.100
There is a mismatch here, so don't expect
the millennials to save the day.

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.080
There is a mismatch of an age gap.

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:36.200
It will come out eventually, and I'll talk
a bit about that in due course.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:41.759
You see, the equity market is also a function
of demographics.

00:30:41.759 --> 00:30:45.480
Now the chart's are a bit noisier because
equities are a much noisier instrument than

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:50.679
most others because they're built on fear
and greed, almost more than any other asset

00:30:50.679 --> 00:30:51.679
class.

00:30:51.679 --> 00:30:56.859
But equities should follow the returns offered
by the labor force participation rate.

00:30:56.859 --> 00:31:03.549
An aging population obviously needs to sell
equities to realize income to retire and live

00:31:03.549 --> 00:31:04.549
off.

00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:06.599
There is no way around that situation.

00:31:06.599 --> 00:31:11.299
They will have to sell equities, and they
will sell as many equities as they can into

00:31:11.299 --> 00:31:15.549
the next recession because, behaviorally,
they need to protect themselves.

00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:20.360
They will become more risk adverse than any
generation in history at that point when the

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:23.070
recession comes and the market sells off.

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:29.480
It is just tied in to human behavior, and
that means that the returns on the S&amp;P are

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.950
going to be somewhat problematic.

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:38.769
And not just a sell off and a rally back afterwards,
but a more extended downturn in the future

00:31:38.769 --> 00:31:44.340
returns of equities and potential, long-term,
compounding, negative returns, which is something

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:46.869
many other countries with aging populations
have seen.

00:31:46.869 --> 00:31:50.379
But the US has not seen it yet, and doesn't
believe it can happen.

00:31:50.379 --> 00:31:55.429
If you think all the things I told you about
consumption, about gasoline sales-- I've told

00:31:55.429 --> 00:32:01.690
you about what's going to happen to equities--
what that also means is inflation is almost

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:04.339
impossible to generate.

00:32:04.339 --> 00:32:07.070
It's impossible because people cannot consume
enough.

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:12.869
The millennials do not offset the largest
spending generation of all history.

00:32:12.869 --> 00:32:15.379
So what you get is a falling of inflation.

00:32:15.379 --> 00:32:22.379
This is why I'm a dyed-in-the-wool reflationist,
and I remain so until something dramatic changes.

00:32:22.379 --> 00:32:27.409
Sure, we could see the end of globalization,
and maybe that could change the structure.

00:32:27.409 --> 00:32:31.919
But I think the slow decline in globalization
is not going to do that.

00:32:31.919 --> 00:32:40.349
So I fear that this incredible fit of inflation
and the births as a percentage of the total

00:32:40.349 --> 00:32:45.559
population-- i.e. the aging of the population--
is going to hold true for a long time to come.

00:32:45.559 --> 00:32:53.089
And that means people have wrongly allocated
in risk-seeking assets versus bonds for example.

00:32:53.089 --> 00:32:59.549
It just makes the world understand that fearing
cash is not the worst thing.

00:32:59.549 --> 00:33:05.230
You see, CPI really is just a reflection of
births as a percentage of the total population.

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:09.909
I.e. the less people are getting born, the
less inflation is going forward.

00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:12.659
So that's the whole trend going forwards.

00:33:12.659 --> 00:33:15.309
And it says inflation's not coming back.

00:33:15.309 --> 00:33:17.279
It's not something we should fear.

00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:18.820
We shouldn't fear bonds.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:23.129
Yes, there is some elements of inflation,
and we're not going to hide from the fact

00:33:23.129 --> 00:33:25.669
that inflation's strangely calculated.

00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:29.789
And that certain things have seen huge inflation,
such as rents and health care.

00:33:29.789 --> 00:33:34.019
And other things have seen huge deflation,
such as the price of Real Vision.

00:33:34.019 --> 00:33:38.179
But there's a number of things that balance
that out, and you've seen the Million Prices

00:33:38.179 --> 00:33:39.179
Project.

00:33:39.179 --> 00:33:44.359
It tells you that broad inflation is not really
there, and it is driven by this phenomena

00:33:44.359 --> 00:33:48.589
of age and demographics.

00:33:48.589 --> 00:33:53.980
So this is why this is the biggest story in
the world.

00:33:53.980 --> 00:34:01.409
We have the richest generation in all history,
by all measures, but with the median person

00:34:01.409 --> 00:34:08.639
with no savings, with too much risk-taking
investments, way too many equities versus

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:14.470
fixed income or any other investment-- and
certainly over cash-- at the point in the

00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:19.419
business cycle that is getting mature and
we're waiting for the next recession to roll

00:34:19.419 --> 00:34:20.750
along.

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:25.840
When that recession comes, it's going to half
equity prices-- or more.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:29.220
This is the most overvalued stock market in
history.

00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:35.790
And therefore, we should expect the price
of equities to fall significantly.

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:40.890
That leaves a huge hole in the balance sheet
of all of those people, the biggest group

00:34:40.890 --> 00:34:43.820
on earth ever to retire.

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:46.899
They won't be able to buy equities to buy
the dip.

00:34:46.899 --> 00:34:48.370
They'll have gone.

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:53.200
The gen-xers and millennials can't afford
to buy that dip.

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:58.830
This is a huge risk to the largest generation
of all time.

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:03.210
And it's something people need to be massively
aware of.

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:07.300
You need to think really hard about the risks
you're taking this late in the cycle.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:12.300
I completely understand you might not have
the money to be able to retire.

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:16.980
But it's better to have what little you have
now than have half of this later.

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:20.130
It's something you really have to think about.

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:25.030
Now many of you will think about, well, how
are the government going to stop this?

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:27.300
And how the Federal Reserve going to stop
this?

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.700
And they will try because they have to.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.640
And this is where some of the problems lie.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:37.700
If you believe in free markets, the right
answer would be for that baby boom generation

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:43.430
to pass their wealth on to their kids, either
via inheritance or by transfer of assets at

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:45.710
a low price that the kids can buy.

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:50.880
So that's the accumulation of equities at
lower prices that the baby boomers had in

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.740
the '70s and '80s.

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:58.310
Particularly in the early '80s when they really
started buying equities, Ps we're below 10,

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:02.010
8, 7, 6-- a lifetime opportunity.

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:07.020
The millennials faced with the same investing
set right now have an all time record over

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:14.560
evaluated stock market, an all time record
valuation bond market, all time overvalued

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:15.560
real estate market.

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:21.370
They have nowhere to invest that has a positive
rate of return over the next 5 or 10 years.

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:23.740
It is a stupid point for them to invest.

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.210
What they need is lower prices in all of these.

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:29.650
The baby boomers should supply it in a free
market.

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:31.950
But it's unlikely to happen.

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:35.850
The Federal Reserve are like to step in the
way and increase the balance sheets I showed

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:36.850
you.

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:41.660
They're likely to be buying stocks, buying
pension assets, stopping those pension assets

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:42.970
go plummeting.

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:46.690
Now that means that the stock market gets
supported.

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:51.580
The Fed start owning the equity market, exactly
as the Japanese have done.

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:55.610
But it means that the young generation can't
buy them because they're too expensive.

00:36:55.610 --> 00:37:00.240
What happens to the real estate market, is
that the clearing mechanism-- possibly.

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:04.630
Or do the baby boomers and millennials end
up living together?

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:06.950
I think that's the most likely outcome.

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:11.670
That's what the pre-war generation did, and
that's maybe how this will all end up is we

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:14.700
have larger households of more household members.

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:20.420
And I think that would make certain sense
to society, and would free up a bit of savings,

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:26.260
and would help counteract the loss of savings
that the baby boomers are going to have.

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.770
You see, this is a really tricky world to
navigate.

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:33.930
And I think you really all need to think hard
and fast about what you're going to do and

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:36.080
the plans you have.

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:42.300
There are also financial market people that
said there are opportunities in this.

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:46.390
Although, it makes me feel a bit grim to say
there's an opportunity in what I see as the

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:50.460
biggest crisis a generation has ever faced
in financial terms.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:52.330
And it's not a bank crash.

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:57.250
It's a systemic loss of savings from everybody.

00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:58.250
But there are opportunities.

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:03.141
Because, you see, once you understand the
world through a behavioral standpoint, you

00:38:03.141 --> 00:38:08.580
understand that different people faced with
different issues will behave differently.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:11.630
And that means they will change how they spend.

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:15.020
We've already seen this in the restaurant
sector.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:19.631
As the baby boomers are moving towards retirement,
they're starting to spend less in restaurants.

00:38:19.631 --> 00:38:22.980
Restaurants have really struggled in recent
years.

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.480
They've been firing people.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:28.020
They have had less profits than they've seen
for a while.

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.290
They've been in and out of recession.

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:34.740
We've seen it in a number of consumption areas
within the economy that there is a problem

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:40.230
as these people are starting to finally save
as much as they can before they go into retirement.

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:43.550
But it does mean they'll do certain things.

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:45.210
And I call this Boomerville.

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:49.360
It's the world to understand when people retire.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:55.290
You see, go again back to that chart of the
net worth of the median household.

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:57.560
They have $53,000 in their house.

00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:00.510
So are they supposed to sell their house?

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:05.790
That basically gets them to live for another
year and a bit.

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:08.090
Don't forget, they wanted $45,000 a year.

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:13.110
The house only gives them $52,000 of equity.

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:18.070
So with this so few savings and this little
cash, what will they do?

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:23.020
Well, you see, there's a different consumption
pattern that's going to come.

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:25.310
And it's a slightly grim consumption pattern.

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:31.810
If you also think about why the middle of
America was so pissed off is because they

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:36.610
didn't participate in a lot of the final stages
of what is going on.

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:41.820
The closer you are to that median person,
the further away you are from any boom.

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:47.760
And you see, if we understand how those people
live now-- the really neglected from society--

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:53.030
it is actually the leading indicator of where
many more people will need to go.

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:54.030
And that's sad.

00:39:54.030 --> 00:40:02.260
It's going to increase, probably, populism
within the economy and certainly a bifurcation

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:07.350
of politics even further than we've seen today
because it's going to be tough on people.

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:10.370
Dining is going to go towards fast food.

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:15.120
It's still sadly true that it's easier and
cheaper to get food from McDonald's than it

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.350
is to cook yourself.

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:19.480
That hits supermarket sales.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.830
That hits a number of people, particularly
the restaurant industry.

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:26.340
But it keeps fast food sales ticking along
nicely.

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:31.730
It's the cheapest way for the masses to afford
to eat, and that's not good for the overall

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:33.610
health of the population.

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:39.250
It could, actually, reduce the life expectancy
of the population too and continue to drive

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:41.080
the obesity epidemic.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.910
It's really not good.

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:48.770
Now if you think about the $52,000 in the
house, well, that basically gets you to buy

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:50.130
a trailer park.

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:54.990
Now trailer parks become very interesting
for people because they can get rid of the

00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:59.700
debt around a house, own the assets of a trailer
park, and release some cash.

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.990
So owning a trailer is a key thing.

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:06.200
Now, trailer parks, I think are already high
yielding investments.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.850
You can get basically 18% returns.

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:15.100
And there's a listed trailer park business
owned by Sam Zell that I think is an interesting

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.100
play here.

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:19.460
There's a number of ways of playing this downsizing
of housing.

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:21.820
But it is an important feature that's to come.

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:26.790
And again, it's less of the Mac mansions and
the other things that we saw in 2007.

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:31.810
It's just anybody trying to realign equity
from their regular homes.

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:33.950
The other thing are cars.

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:38.670
Nobody is ever going to buy a new one again,
none of this generation will.

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:41.180
They will keep onto their car as long as possible.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:48.100
We saw this a long time ago in Germany where
your average car turnovers were every 3 or

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.660
4 years people buy a new car.

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:52.500
It then moved to 8,9, 10 years.

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:53.500
It's my father.

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:58.420
You know, that guy, my dad, hasn't changed
his car for the last 15 years now.

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.330
That is going to be very common.

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:04.360
The used car dealership market, yeah, that's
OK.

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.400
It's not so bad.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:10.120
But still not good because people are still
not buying as many new cars.

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.520
There's a big problem.

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:15.700
The entire world is betting that China is
going to take up the demand from the baby

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:16.700
boomers.

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.150
I'm not so sure about that.

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:21.850
What we do know is the millennial generation
currently is less interested by cars.

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:27.380
So they're more likely buyers of secondhand
bangers than they are buying new cars.

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:31.260
They don't see the status symbol involved
that older generations did.

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:37.420
But anyway, the point here is the consumption
pattern of America and Europe is changing,

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.790
and it's going to change dramatically.

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:43.770
That's going to change the investment philosophy
and where you could hide in the stock market

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:47.520
that's going to be under stress or where you
can find real opportunities.

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:51.810
I do think that it is going to drive bond
yields lower.

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:55.150
I think most of you know my view on bonds.

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:57.940
Unless something changes, demographics will
trump all.

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:01.791
The other thing we need to think about, many
of us watching Real Vision, is we are part

00:43:01.791 --> 00:43:03.020
of the financial industry.

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:09.270
You see, the financial industry was one of
the biggest secular booms of all time.

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:12.580
It was driven by this baby boom generation.

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:18.090
When they took on debt, it created an enormous
amount of opportunity and a swelling of the

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:20.390
financial system.

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:26.370
When they invested in pensions and the 401(k)
system was created, it created an asset boom

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:27.370
that spread.

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:32.840
That asset boom, between those 2 building
blocks, went into the hedge fund industry.

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:37.890
They went into the private equity industry,
the venture capital industry, the real estate

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:38.890
industry.

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:45.430
Everything we understand as the asset management
industry was driven by these people.

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:48.870
And these people are going to take their money
out.

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:56.560
That is an enormous change and the final return
to trend for the economy and its outsized

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:58.530
financial industry.

00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:00.580
We're all seeing it in the financial world.

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:01.960
We've all seen the banks shrinking.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:07.700
We've also seen things like the robotization
within the industry and the changes taking

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:08.910
place.

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:14.580
We've seen the disruptors, the vultures hanging
around the system like Bitcoin, Ethereum picking

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:17.100
at the carcass of the financial industry.

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:18.330
It's true it's going to change.

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:20.230
Now, it will adapt.

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:23.060
Some of the smartest people in the world are
in that industry.

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:24.060
They will adapt.

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.060
They will change fast.

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:29.080
Looking how firms like Goldman are adapting
their business model is breathtaking in its

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.080
speed.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:33.700
It's at startup speed change that they're
doing stuff.

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:36.510
But there are other things that are going
to happen, too.

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:42.000
All of the people in the industry are going
to have to think, how do I get the millennial?

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.920
And how do I get them to invest their life
savings?

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:47.660
Now, they're right.

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:51.210
They need to invest savings to save for their
future.

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:54.820
But they were wrong in how they made it before.

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:59.260
They made false promises to a generation of
which they couldn't keep.

00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:01.710
This time around, they get to wipe the slate
clean.

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:05.520
Or they get to defer the blame on somebody
else.

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.410
Let's call it the robo advisors.

00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:08.410
It's not our fault.

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:10.530
The algorithm gave it to us this way.

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:12.370
So that's something we need to think about.

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:16.610
And the industry needs to manage that messaging
unless it wants to get held to blame again

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:18.950
some point down the future.

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:22.930
But the real opportunities may lie with the
future of the financial industry.

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:29.370
Again, if you remember, this millennial generation
is faced with the all time record valuations

00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:34.730
of equities, bonds, real estate, private equity,
pretty much anywhere.

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:38.130
There is no opportunity for them to buy assets.

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:39.930
Yes, of course, you could buy gold.

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:40.930
That's cheap.

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:42.650
Some commodities are relatively cheap.

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:49.150
But commodities tend to be more cyclical than
secular, and that becomes somewhat of an issue

00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:51.840
when you're trying to build long term wealth.

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:56.010
The right answer is for young people to build
businesses.

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.290
The startup culture is exploding.

00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:00.260
This is incredibly important.

00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:02.610
This is the structure of the future economy.

00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:07.490
If you can shift from a financial economy
to an entrepreneurship-based economy, you'll

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:13.510
build an agile, nimble, and developing economy
that looks for opportunity and generates GDP

00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:14.510
growth.

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:15.860
It may not employ as many people.

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:19.460
That's fine because so many people are leaving
the labor force.

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:24.360
So I'm really encouraged about the startup
and entrepreneurship culture that's generating

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:28.550
around the world and resonating everywhere
from the Middle East to India, from America

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:29.550
to Berlin.

00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:32.060
It's everywhere, and I love that.

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:36.360
The other thing is the crypto space and the
blockchain space.

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:41.870
Now, this is slightly contentious, but it's
something I've been mulling in my head.

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:48.640
If you think about that problematic allocation
to all of the other assets, and you have something

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:54.130
like a cryptocurrency or a set of cryptocurrencies,
or even ICOs-- and I know most of them are

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:55.540
complete scams.

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:56.740
But there are some that are good.

00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:57.740
And the world will change.

00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:01.740
And they will get regulated, and will be some
amazing opportunities.

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:11.460
Now if said the future expected return from
a cryptocurrency over the next 30 years is

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:18.080
zero or a million, and we're at-- let's use
Bitcoin as the example-- we're at about $8,000,

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:19.080
$7,500.

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:26.620
Well, then, as a millennial, you're basically
faced with the same fact set that you had

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:32.400
in equities back in 1982 or in bonds back
in '82.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.440
Was inflation going to be there forever?

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:39.540
Or was the 18% returns you were given in bonds
exceptional?

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:44.210
Was the P of 6 meaning the cult of equity
was dead?

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:50.610
Or was there a long-term opportunity in America
and the global economy to revive itself?

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:53.680
I think crypto is here to stay.

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:57.130
The blockchain development will come.

00:47:57.130 --> 00:48:02.980
I think the ICO market will develop to be
rich and deep, and as large and as important

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:04.330
as the equity market is now.

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:06.310
It will be like the credit markets.

00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:09.760
It'll be an ancillary, a big part of the financial
market.

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:14.710
So if you're looking for the future, and if
you're looking for where the money will be

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:18.800
in the future-- where life savings will go--
it's going to be there over time.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:24.450
Now, I'm no crypto bull right now, but I can
understand something with a risk-reward that

00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:29.830
is attractive to somebody now who wants to
create a saving for the future.

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:33.020
So I just want to leave you to think about
all of the things I've said.

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:37.080
There's a lot to digest here, and I'd really
love your feedback on this topic because I

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.080
think it's misunderstood.

00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:43.780
But it is the single most important topic
in the world today.
