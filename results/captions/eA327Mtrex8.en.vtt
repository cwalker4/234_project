00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.360
Hey, I'm Elsa

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.200
and I'm Barron

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:07.080
and today is our one-year anniversary of
 living in this Scamp trailer.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.800
We were living in a one-bedroom
 apartment about five years ago

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.640
when Baron brought up the idea to me.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.780
The obvious thing that I had on my side

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.900
was that houses are just stupid
expensive and this was a way that we

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.859
could pay off the house for an amount of
money that actually makes sense.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.280
We were draining away $700 with that
apartment and $900 for a house from a family friend.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.149
And that's just rent like
utilities and everything--

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.220
and that's just Kansas City, too.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.840
With Barron I started doing
some research on tiny houses

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.840
looking at YouTube and forums.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.320
I would just find the
highlights and then bring Elsa all the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.760
highlights of the cutest one or the
one that was like the most..

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.800
something that she would dig and then over and over again..

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.540
They're really freaking cool.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.160
Tiny houses are SWEET.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.300
Fall of 2015 we decided to 
take a trip to Portland.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.660
We'd been looking at some tiny house builders.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.860
We thought that we would get 
a tiny house built for us

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.520
so that we could save time.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.280
We wouldn't have to pay rent living in a space

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.840
as we were building our tiny house.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.480
We like the idea of a tiny house 
because we could build something custom.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.280
So we could get exactly what we wanted

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.299
laid out how we wanted. We could have
workspace, a nice bathroom,

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.240
all the things that we needed. --Or thought we needed.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.670
Ironically we wanted a space

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.920
where Elsa could set up cameras and have
like a good place to do tutorials and stuff

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.860
and it's kind of hilarious because
we have 3 cameras set up right now

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.400
and we're doing it right here.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.160
So, we toured tiny houses and after

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.200
we left Portland we loved them, like we
were all in. I thought it was a great idea

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.600
and then we got home and looked into
loans, like how we were gonna pay for it

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.350
because they were anywhere between
50 to 80 grand depending on how you did it

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.409
which was still a lot cheaper than
any of the houses we could've bought in

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.600
Kansas City, so we were still like, okay, 
we can own a thing--

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.320
Then we thought about it and we could do so many things with fifty to eighty thousand dollars.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.300
That's a lot of money and that's a lot
of commitment

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.580
We've both been self-employed for
several years, so getting a loan with our

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.440
variable incomes and self-employed tax
returns wasn't gonna be easy.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.360
It's also amatter of is it an RV loan?
Is it a house loan?

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.700
The other thing was we couldn't find
anywhere to park it legally.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.580
In Kansas City especially.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.200
There was nowhere that we could
 legally do it aside from an RV park.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.980
But then we would be paying rent 
to an RV park every month

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.380
and living in an RV park in a
tiny house which was not super sensical, no.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.540
Tiny homes also are very heavy, so you
effectively need a semi truck to pull them around

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.200
and they're not meant to be
towed all the time.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.660
So we needed a place to park this thing and to 
not move it unless we had to.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.500
And then all those combined

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.040
brought us to the idea of RVs.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.060
People mentioned it often like, why don't you just get an RV?

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.600
We stubbornly clung to the tiny house thing because it's cool.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.480
RVs are generally pretty heinous looking
 they look like something

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.640
out of that 70s show, like intentionally.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.660
And we just thought we needed more space, too.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.720
We thought that an RV wasn't
gonna cut it.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.920
It started making more sense

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.400
that RVs are made to be traveled in,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.580
RVs are significantly cheaper it was

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.280
It was easy to get a loan on them - yeah
they're legal.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.900
My grandparents have been living in their RVs

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.420
through the winters
for I think my entire life.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.020
They're snowbirds and they would go down to Mexico
 so we drove up to Iowa

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.240
and with them and toured a bunch of RVs.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.180
We went to some RV retailers 
to look at some used RVs

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.400
and we looked at toy haulers, for example, 
and utility trailers

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.480
Like an empty UHaul.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.760
Because because they were convertible we could do whatever we wanted to them.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.580
We also looked at truck bed campers with
the camper in the truck bed of a truck.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.620
and we looked at some other 
tow behind trailers.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.020
We really couldn't find anything much 
smaller than 20 feet though.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.380
Yeah, and we were looking for something smaller.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.600
Primarily so that we
wouldn't have to get a giant truck.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.440
Elsa's grandpa, Huck, insisted that we
have a truck over and over again,

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.820
"You gotta have a damn truck!"
He wouldn't let it go

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.760
Well because for most of these you do

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.760
and we would have, so that
was gonna be an added expense.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.640
An expense that was probably gonna cost
 more than the camper itself.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.660
While we were in Iowa, we were also on Craigslist trying to find

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.840
some other places to look for trailers

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.880
and up finding a teeny tiny little fiberglass trailer

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.320
in my grandma's neighborhood.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.940
It was the first Scamp that we had ever seen and we toured it but it was really small.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.580
So small, it had a bathroom so that cut 
down on its whole size.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.040
I thought that it could never be 
something livable, but it was really cool.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.040
It was an older guy that had it and he

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.460
said that he had travelled the west
coast up and down and back to Iowa

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.560
pulling the scamp with his Subaru which
was really appealing to me.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.600
That opened an entire new category of things we could live in

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.320
that maybe wouldn't require us 
buying an expensive truck.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.140
We started looking into fiberglass trailers and at

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.889
this point we thought that a bathroom
was a definite necessity so we were

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.760
looking at the 16-foot models of the
scamp primarily.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.580
And as we were thinking about it it was like, well if we didn't have a bathroom

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.780
we could go down to the next size in Scamps

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.480
to a 13 foot. 
Do we really need a bathroom?

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.320
And after a bunch of thought we kind of realized we didn't want to be pooping in our tiny space,

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.039
we didn't want to have to carry around all
this black water, drain it, clean it,

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.639
that would take up a lot of space and also
just be a huge pain in the butt,

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.289
and people shouldn't be in a bathroom more than 30 minutes a day, so why would we

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:38.480
dedicate 20% of our living quarters to a
place where we spend such little amounts of time?

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.260
There's toilets everywhere. Everywhere! 
In every public establishment there's a toilet

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.200
and several in everybody's homes.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.320
If we ever needed a toilet, or even now if we decide that we want one for whatever reason

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.700
We could do a composting toilet and just put it under where we have our shoes.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.920
So then we started broadening our search
 online to 13ft fiberglass trailers.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.680
We tried to snag like five of them-

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.260
If they're under ten thousand dollars they're gone or claimed in like, 2 days.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.370
They hold their value well, we really had no idea that

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.820
there's such a market for fiberglass
trailers.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.660
They're awesome- yeah they're really cool.-
We saw a guy in Minnesota selling his

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.260
for 4500 with some water damage. 
1988, so a little bit older.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:24.220
We borrowed our friend Jordan Mackey's truck and drove it all the way up an hour south of Canada.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.120
When we toured the Scamp, it had
more water damage than we had previously thought.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:35.060
So, we talked to the guy down to $3,700 and gave him
 the cash and hooked up the Scamp

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.540
And drove it back!

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.080
20 hours total and then finally decided to 
stop at Des Moines, Iowa,

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.740
Walmart parking lot and stay the
night

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.120
I cried.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.560
Reality was finally kicking in like,

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.500
oh my god we're gonna.. We're doin it! 
We did it!

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.860
We just did it so, we're doin it

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.240
I felt pretty good because every time 
I looked in the rearview mirror

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.660
and saw our house that was completely paid off 
behind us I was like, okay.. :D

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.540
Yeah... -Elsa not so much.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.300
We were planning on using my Pontiac Vibe,
 it's rated to tow about 2,000lbs.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.840
I was on the phone with my dad, talking to him about whether we could do it with the Vibe

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.660
and he was like,

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.480
couldn't you just do it with the Mini?

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.400
I guess, maybe.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.220
and we looked into it,

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.720
put a tow hitch on the back, took it on a
test drive and the Mini Cooper became

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.820
our tow vehicle for an entire year.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.460
A month before we moved into the Scamp full time,

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.960
I went with a friend to Vietnam 
and you stayed back and you worked on-

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.620
I worked on like all the water damage and just really made the Scamp livable.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.240
And the day I got back to the US,
 we moved out of our house and

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.440
into the Scamp.. and it was a pretty big
thing

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.460
At first it was very challenging,

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.360
it is a smaller space.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.120
Another difficult thing was getting around

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.410
societal validation, to like keep doing
our thing. It seemed like everybody that

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:04.860
we talked to was skeptical and would
just tell us that that's not gonna work.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.800
So to keep our head on straight and just keep 
pushing with our vision was

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.880
pretty difficult, especially initially.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.600
--Right now we're kind of like, what should we do? We have our whole house

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.180
basically on our backs we can,

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.240
we can go anywhere!

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.960
But now after your practice we

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:28.800
are living full-time in nature, we have
more time, we're creating more.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.080
We're making so many new friends and connecting with people that we wouldn't have been able to.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.740
And we have a cool place for our friends from Kansas City

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.540
to come out and hang out, too, which
is pretty awesome.

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:47.350
We are absolutely so much happier living
this way than I could have ever imagined.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:52.920
I would have never guessed that this was
going to be so incredibly perfect.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:57.420
And honestly, solutions have come more
easily than we previously thought.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:02.580
As you do it, or as we do it, we figure
out solutions to things more quickly

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.500
than I could have imagined, truly.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.320
So now we're here on a mountain 
with our new Subaru

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.640
and a year of scamp life under our belt.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.180
And so, our journey begins..

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.600
Again!

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.420
Thanks for watching and we'll see you in
our next video! Bye!
