CHRIS.

00:00:02.106 --> 00:00:02.672
&gt;&gt; Chris: KEVIN CORKE

00:00:02.673 --> 00:00:03.573
REPORTING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE,

00:00:03.574 --> 00:00:06.076
KEVIN, THANKS.

00:00:06.077 --> 00:00:08.311
JOINING ME NOW FROM NEW YORK,

00:00:08.312 --> 00:00:10.046
THE PRESIDENT'S LEAD LAWYER RUDY

00:00:10.047 --> 00:00:10.413
GIULIANI.

00:00:10.414 --> 00:00:12.449
MAYER, WELCOME BACK TO

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.049
"FOX NEWS SUNDAY" ."

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.152
&gt;&gt; Rudy: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:00:15.153 --> 00:00:16.119
THANK YOU, CHRIS.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.254
LET'S START WITH MICHAEL COHEN'S

00:00:17.255 --> 00:00:19.089
ALLEGATION THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.424
DIRECTED HIM TO COMMIT A

00:00:21.425 --> 00:00:23.260
CRIMINAL CAMPAIGN FINANCE

00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:23.894
VIOLATION.

00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:25.228
HERE FIRST IS THE PRESIDENT AND

00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:27.931
THEN MR. COHEN.

00:00:27.932 --> 00:00:29.466
&gt;&gt; I NEVER DIRECTED HIM TO DO

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:29.933
ANYTHING WRONG.

00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:32.035
WHATEVER HE DID HE DID ON HIS

00:00:32.036 --> 00:00:32.302
OWN.

00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:35.071
HE'S A LAWYER.

00:00:35.072 --> 00:00:36.473
A LAWYER WHO REPRESENTS A CLIENT

00:00:36.474 --> 00:00:37.941
IS SUPPOSED TO DO THE RIGHT

00:00:37.942 --> 00:00:39.009
THING.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.277
&gt;&gt; HE DIRECTED ME TO MAKE THE

00:00:40.278 --> 00:00:40.744
PAYMENTS.

00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:41.545
HE DIRECTED ME TO BECOME

00:00:41.546 --> 00:00:43.780
INVOLVED IN THESE MATTERS.

00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:45.649
&gt;&gt; Chris: QUESTION, DID

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.616
MR. TRUMP DIRECT MICHAEL COHEN

00:00:46.617 --> 00:00:48.819
TO PAY OFF THESE TWO WOMEN ARE

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.085
NOT?

00:00:49.086 --> 00:00:52.189
&gt;&gt; Rudy: THE TRUTH IS ACTUALLY

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.557
WHAT COHEN TESTIFIED TO UNDER

00:00:53.558 --> 00:00:55.325
OATH BEFORE, SAID WHAT HE

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:57.661
REPEATED NUMEROUS TIMES ON TAPE

00:00:57.662 --> 00:00:58.361
RECORDINGS THAT HE MADE, WHICH

00:00:58.362 --> 00:01:01.798
IS THAT THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:02.499
KNOW ABOUT THIS UNTIL SOMETIME

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.768
INTO IT.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.435
HE DID FIND OUT ABOUT IT AND

00:01:05.436 --> 00:01:07.571
EVENTUALLY REIMBURSE HIM.

00:01:07.572 --> 00:01:09.039
BUT THIS IS A HARD THING TO DO.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.473
LAWYERS DO THIS ALL THE TIME BUT

00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:12.876
EVEN IF IT WERE TRUE, IT'S NOT A

00:01:12.877 --> 00:01:14.411
CRIME.

00:01:14.412 --> 00:01:15.412
THE PAYMENT OF MONEY IN A

00:01:15.413 --> 00:01:17.214
SITUATION LIKE THIS HAS BEEN

00:01:17.215 --> 00:01:18.715
COVERED IN THE EDWARDS CASE.

00:01:18.716 --> 00:01:21.151
NOT ONLY THE ACQUITTAL AND HUNG

00:01:21.152 --> 00:01:22.853
JURY IN THE EDWARDS CASE BUT THE

00:01:22.854 --> 00:01:24.187
FACT THAT THE FAC LOOKED AT

00:01:24.188 --> 00:01:26.389
THOSE VIOLATIONS IN A THE WORK

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.790
VIOLATIONS.

00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:27.424
&gt;&gt; Chris: I PROMISE WE'RE

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:28.191
GOING TO GET TO THAT IN A MINUTE

00:01:28.192 --> 00:01:31.595
BUT LET'S GET TO THE SIMPLE FACT

00:01:31.596 --> 00:01:32.195
QUESTION OF WHETHER THE

00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:32.929
PRESIDENT DIRECTED COHEN TO MAKE

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.199
THESE PAYMENTS OR NOT.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.734
COHEN SAYS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS

00:01:37.735 --> 00:01:40.837
NOT TO BE BELIEVED, HERE HE IS.

00:01:40.838 --> 00:01:41.571
&gt;&gt; THE MAN DOESN'T TELL THE

00:01:41.572 --> 00:01:44.174
TRUTH AND IT'S SAD.

00:01:44.175 --> 00:01:45.008
THAT I SHOULD TAKE

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.143
RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS DIRTY

00:01:47.144 --> 00:01:48.345
DEEDS.

00:01:48.346 --> 00:01:50.513
&gt;&gt; Rudy: THAT IS SOMEWHERE.

00:01:50.514 --> 00:01:53.617
HE WAS THE LAWYER IN THAT

00:01:53.618 --> 00:01:53.984
SITUATION.

00:01:53.985 --> 00:01:55.352
&gt;&gt; Chris: DOES THE PRESIDENT

00:01:55.353 --> 00:01:56.820
TELL THE TRUTH OR NOT?

00:01:56.821 --> 00:01:58.121
&gt;&gt; Rudy: THE PRESIDENT IS

00:01:58.122 --> 00:01:59.489
TELLING THE TRUTH, YES.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.990
THIS MAN IS LYING.

00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:02.325
IT IS NOT A BIG SURPRISE TO YOU,

00:02:02.326 --> 00:02:03.526
THAT MICHAEL COHEN'S LINE?

00:02:03.527 --> 00:02:05.195
THE MAN GOT UP IN FRONT OF THE

00:02:05.196 --> 00:02:06.596
JUDGE AND SAID I WAS FIERCELY

00:02:06.597 --> 00:02:09.366
LOYAL TO DONALD TRUMP.

00:02:09.367 --> 00:02:10.634
NONSENSE HE WAS FIERCELY LOYAL

00:02:10.635 --> 00:02:11.768
TO HIM.

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.036
HE TAPED HIM, LIED TO HIM,

00:02:13.037 --> 00:02:15.071
REVEALED THE TAPE AND DID

00:02:15.072 --> 00:02:15.772
SOMETHING A LAWYER I'VE NEVER

00:02:15.773 --> 00:02:19.376
HEARD EVER DID, TAPE RECORD HIS

00:02:19.377 --> 00:02:20.110
OWN CLIENT.

00:02:20.111 --> 00:02:21.378
HE SAT THERE WITH CHRIS CUOMO,

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.115
TOLD HIM HE WASN'T BEING TAPED,

00:02:25.116 --> 00:02:25.849
AND HE LIED TO HIM AND TAPED HIM

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.885
FOR TWO HOURS.

00:02:28.886 --> 00:02:29.986
THE MAN IS A COMPLETE

00:02:29.987 --> 00:02:34.624
PATHOLOGICAL LIAR.

00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:38.161
NEVER ON THE WITNESS STAND.

00:02:38.162 --> 00:02:38.762
&gt;&gt; Chris: I UNDERSTAND.

00:02:38.763 --> 00:02:42.165
THE REAL QUESTION IS THE

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:42.933
CREDIBILITY OF THE PRESIDENT,

00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:45.135
NOT THE CREDIBILITY OF MICHAEL

00:02:45.136 --> 00:02:45.435
COHEN.

00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:48.271
LET ME JUST FINISH.

00:02:48.272 --> 00:02:49.372
THE PRESIDENT HAS CHANGED HIS

00:02:49.373 --> 00:02:50.507
STORY REPEATEDLY ABOUT WHETHER

00:02:50.508 --> 00:02:52.842
OR NOT HE KNEW ABOUT HUSH MONEY.

00:02:52.843 --> 00:02:54.911
HERE IS WHAT HE SET ON

00:02:54.912 --> 00:02:56.012
AIR FORCE ONE, THE PRESIDENT,

00:02:56.013 --> 00:02:56.846
SAT ON AIR FORCE ONE THIS APRIL,

00:02:56.847 --> 00:03:01.584
EIGHT MONTHS AGO.

00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:05.956
&gt;&gt; DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THE

00:03:05.957 --> 00:03:08.525
PAYMENT?

00:03:08.526 --> 00:03:22.806
WHY DID MICHAEL COHEN MAKE IT?

00:03:22.807 --> 00:03:23.473
&gt;&gt; Chris: THE PRESIDENT SAYS

00:03:23.474 --> 00:03:25.408
HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.244
ANY PAYMENTS BUT IN ONE OF THOSE

00:03:28.245 --> 00:03:30.347
TAPES WERE COHEN SURREPTITIOUSLY

00:03:30.348 --> 00:03:33.083
TAPED TO THE PRESIDENT BACK IN

00:03:33.084 --> 00:03:34.751
SEPTEMBER OF 2016, HERE ARE THE

00:03:34.752 --> 00:03:35.585
PRESIDENT AND COHEN DISCUSSING A

00:03:35.586 --> 00:03:37.954
POTENTIAL PAYMENT.

00:03:37.955 --> 00:03:39.856
LET'S LISTEN TO THE TAPE FIRST.

00:03:39.857 --> 00:03:40.790
&gt;&gt; Rudy: I REMEMBER IT WELL.

00:03:40.791 --> 00:03:42.592
&gt;&gt; I'M ALL OVER THAT.

00:03:42.593 --> 00:03:47.397
WHEN IT COMES TIME FOR THE

00:03:47.398 --> 00:03:52.068
FINANCING, PAYMENTS.

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.136
&gt;&gt; Chris: SO WHICH IS IT?

00:03:53.137 --> 00:03:54.471
TO THE PRESIDENT KNOW ABOUT THE

00:03:54.472 --> 00:03:56.373
HUSH MONEY PAYMENTS ARE NOT?

00:03:56.374 --> 00:04:00.677
&gt;&gt; Rudy: THE EVENT YOU ARE NOT

00:04:00.678 --> 00:04:01.578
TALKING ABOUT.

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:02.746
I GOT CRITICIZED FOR REVEALING

00:04:02.747 --> 00:04:04.314
WAS WHAT I FIRST CAME INTO THE

00:04:04.315 --> 00:04:04.614
CASE.

00:04:04.615 --> 00:04:05.315
NOBODY REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHY I

00:04:05.316 --> 00:04:06.950
WAS DOING IT.

00:04:06.951 --> 00:04:07.684
WHEN I FIRST CAME INTO THE CASE,

00:04:07.685 --> 00:04:10.653
WE WENT THROUGH THE WHOLE CASE.

00:04:10.654 --> 00:04:11.821
THE PRESIDENT SAID SOME NOTES,

00:04:11.822 --> 00:04:12.555
DOCUMENTS, THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND

00:04:12.556 --> 00:04:16.393
I WENT OUT AND SAID NO.

00:04:16.394 --> 00:04:17.727
AFTER THE PAYMENTS TOOK PLACE

00:04:17.728 --> 00:04:18.862
AND BEFORE THE REVELATIONS YOU

00:04:18.863 --> 00:04:21.498
ARE TALKING ABOUT ON

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:25.135
AIR FORCE ONE, THE PRESIDENT DID

00:04:25.136 --> 00:04:27.637
TALK TO COHEN OR PEOPLE IN

00:04:27.638 --> 00:04:28.605
BETWEEN AND THEY ARRANGED TO

00:04:28.606 --> 00:04:29.739
REIMBURSE COHEN.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.541
THIS WAS AFTER THE PAYMENT WAS

00:04:31.542 --> 00:04:34.811
MADE, AFTER IT WAS OVER, AFTER

00:04:34.812 --> 00:04:36.279
THE CAMPAIGN WAS OVER.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.547
&gt;&gt; Chris: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:04:37.548 --> 00:04:38.248
CONVERSATION IN SEPTEMBER OF

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:40.216
2016 DURING THE CAMPAIGN.

00:04:40.217 --> 00:04:42.252
THE PRESIDENT IS CLEARLY AWARE

00:04:42.253 --> 00:04:44.654
THAT DAVID PACKER, THE HEAD OF

00:04:44.655 --> 00:04:45.789
"NATIONAL ENQUIRER" HAD PAID OFF

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:46.456
KAREN McDOUGALL AND THEY ARE

00:04:46.457 --> 00:04:50.994
TALKING ABOUT REIMBURSING HIM

00:04:50.995 --> 00:04:51.628
FOR THAT PAYMENT.

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:52.328
&gt;&gt; Rudy: THERE'S A BIG

00:04:52.329 --> 00:04:54.364
DIFFERENCE HERE.

00:04:54.365 --> 00:04:55.131
THAT WAS A CONVERSATION HE WAS

00:04:55.132 --> 00:04:56.299
ASKED THE MIDDLE OF THE

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.666
CAMPAIGN.

00:04:56.667 --> 00:04:57.400
I WAS WITH HIM BACK THEN IN THE

00:04:57.401 --> 00:04:59.335
MIDDLE OF THE CAMPAIGN.

00:04:59.336 --> 00:05:04.074
HE'S WORKING 18 HOURS A DAY.

00:05:04.075 --> 00:05:05.542
I'M NOT ABLE TO REMEMBER A LOT

00:05:05.543 --> 00:05:09.145
OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN 2016.

00:05:09.146 --> 00:05:10.013
HE WAS ASKED AT ONE TIME.

00:05:10.014 --> 00:05:13.483
WHEN HE SAT DOWN WITH HIS LAWYER

00:05:13.484 --> 00:05:14.918
WE IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED IT.

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.986
NOBODY PUSHED US, NOBODY FOUND

00:05:16.987 --> 00:05:18.955
IT, WE FOUND IT AND WE CORRECTED

00:05:18.956 --> 00:05:19.222
IT.

00:05:19.223 --> 00:05:19.956
I GOT CRITICIZED LIKE CRAZY FOR

00:05:19.957 --> 00:05:23.893
DOING IT.

00:05:23.894 --> 00:05:27.063
&gt;&gt; Chris: ACCORDING BOTH TO

00:05:27.064 --> 00:05:30.300
COHEN AND TO DAVID PACKER,

00:05:30.301 --> 00:05:31.701
AGAIN, THE HEAD -- WAS THE HEAD

00:05:31.702 --> 00:05:32.368
OF THE "NATIONAL ENQUIRER."

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:33.303
THEY SAY THEY WERE IN A MEETING

00:05:33.304 --> 00:05:35.638
WITH DONALD TRUMP IN THE SUMMER

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.907
OF 2016 IN WHICH THEY DISCUSSED

00:05:37.908 --> 00:05:38.641
THE PAYMENT TO KAREN

00:05:38.642 --> 00:05:39.008
McDOUGALL.

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.277
&gt;&gt; Rudy: IT DOESN'T MATTER.

00:05:41.278 --> 00:05:42.479
WHETHER IT HAPPENED OR IT DIDN'T

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.749
HAPPEN, IT'S NOT ILLEGAL.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:47.417
&gt;&gt; Chris: YOUR MOVING SHELLS

00:05:47.418 --> 00:05:49.219
AROUND ON ME.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.121
EITHER HAPPENED OR DIDN'T

00:05:51.122 --> 00:05:51.454
HAPPEN.

00:05:51.455 --> 00:05:53.656
&gt;&gt; Rudy: THAT'S WHAT LAWYERS

00:05:53.657 --> 00:05:54.124
DO ALL THE TIME.

00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:58.328
YOU ARGUE IN THE ALTERNATIVE.

00:05:58.329 --> 00:05:59.562
I WANT THE TRUTH TOO IN THE

00:05:59.563 --> 00:06:03.233
TRUTH IS, TAPE-RECORDED

00:06:03.234 --> 00:06:03.967
CONVERSATION DID TAKE PLACE, IT

00:06:03.968 --> 00:06:05.502
EXONERATES THE PRESIDENT.

00:06:05.503 --> 00:06:08.270
THE PRESIDENT TELLS COHEN DO IT

00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:09.871
BY CHECK.

00:06:09.872 --> 00:06:11.172
I'M SORRY, I'VE PROSECUTED

00:06:11.173 --> 00:06:11.706
THOUSANDS OF CRIMES.

00:06:11.707 --> 00:06:15.310
NEVER PROSECUTED ONE WHERE THEY

00:06:15.311 --> 00:06:16.211
WANTED TO HIDE SOMETHING AND

00:06:16.212 --> 00:06:17.312
THEY DID IT BY CHECK.

00:06:17.313 --> 00:06:18.379
MAKE SURE THEY PAY THEM BACK,

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.348
THEY PAY THEM BACK.

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:21.850
IT EXONERATES HIM.

00:06:21.851 --> 00:06:23.384
I WOULD PLAY THAT CONVERSATION

00:06:23.385 --> 00:06:24.152
IN FRONT OF ANY JURY IN AMERICA

00:06:24.153 --> 00:06:26.521
AND I WOULD CROSS-EXAMINE COHEN

00:06:26.522 --> 00:06:30.592
IN FRONT.

00:06:30.593 --> 00:06:33.094
VERY IMPORTANT, COHEN DID NOT

00:06:33.095 --> 00:06:34.395
PLEAD GUILTY TO CONSPIRACY TO

00:06:34.396 --> 00:06:35.063
VIOLATE THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE

00:06:35.064 --> 00:06:35.363
LAWS.

00:06:35.364 --> 00:06:36.331
IF THEY WERE GOING TO USE THEM

00:06:36.332 --> 00:06:37.832
AS A WITNESS AGAINST ANYBODY YOU

00:06:37.833 --> 00:06:40.902
ALWAYS MAKE THEM PLAYED GUILTY

00:06:40.903 --> 00:06:41.636
TO A CONSPIRACY SO YOU CAN FILL

00:06:41.637 --> 00:06:43.238
THE CONSPIRACY.

00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:48.409
HE PLED GUILTY TO A CRIME OF

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.245
VIOLATING CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAW.

00:06:50.246 --> 00:06:52.213
&gt;&gt; Chris: THE STATEMENT AS

00:06:52.214 --> 00:06:53.081
REFERENCES TO INDIVIDUAL ONE

00:06:53.082 --> 00:06:55.183
WHICH IS DONALD TRUMP.

00:06:55.184 --> 00:06:57.385
HERE'S WHAT YOU TOLD

00:06:57.386 --> 00:06:58.052
"THE DAILY BEAST" THIS WEEK.

00:06:58.053 --> 00:06:59.988
I WANT TO PUT IT UP ON THE

00:06:59.989 --> 00:07:00.321
SCREEN.

00:07:00.322 --> 00:07:02.357
NOBODY GOT KILLED, NOBODY GOT

00:07:02.358 --> 00:07:03.157
ROBBED.

00:07:03.158 --> 00:07:05.126
THIS WAS NOT A BIG CRIME.

00:07:05.127 --> 00:07:08.162
MAYER, WHAT'S THE THRESHOLD

00:07:08.163 --> 00:07:10.832
BETWEEN A CRIME AND A BIG CRIME?

00:07:10.833 --> 00:07:12.267
&gt;&gt; Rudy: MY STATEMENT THERE

00:07:12.268 --> 00:07:14.068
WAS ABOUT THE PROSECUTORS VIEW,

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:16.237
NOT MINE.

00:07:16.238 --> 00:07:17.238
HE WROTE THAT, ACTUALLY

00:07:17.239 --> 00:07:19.240
CORRECTED THAT TO SAY THAT THAT

00:07:19.241 --> 00:07:21.242
WAS TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT.

00:07:21.243 --> 00:07:23.111
MY POINT WAS THERE WAS NO CRIME.

00:07:23.112 --> 00:07:25.313
EVEN IF YOU TAKE THE PROSECUTORS

00:07:25.314 --> 00:07:27.348
VIEWPOINT, THIS PROSECUTOR WAS

00:07:27.349 --> 00:07:29.417
APPOINTED, BOTH OF THEM, THEY

00:07:29.418 --> 00:07:31.786
WERE LOOKING AT COLLUSION, NO

00:07:31.787 --> 00:07:32.687
COLLUSION.

00:07:32.688 --> 00:07:33.121
OBSTRUCTION --

00:07:33.122 --> 00:07:35.924
&gt;&gt; Chris: NO, NO, NO, NO, SIR.

00:07:35.925 --> 00:07:37.892
THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH

00:07:37.893 --> 00:07:38.259
COLLUSION.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.462
OR OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.

00:07:41.463 --> 00:07:42.630
&gt;&gt; Rudy: IF THEY'RE PART OF

00:07:42.631 --> 00:07:44.032
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

00:07:44.033 --> 00:07:46.367
&gt;&gt; Chris: I'M SURE WHEN YOU

00:07:46.368 --> 00:07:49.537
ARE THE U.S. ATTORNEY OF THE

00:07:49.538 --> 00:07:50.438
DISTRICT YOU DIDN'T TAKE ORDERS

00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:53.241
FROM SOMEBODY IN WASHINGTON WHO

00:07:53.242 --> 00:07:55.510
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

00:07:55.511 --> 00:07:56.044
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

00:07:56.045 --> 00:08:00.848
YOU WERE YOUR OWN --

00:08:00.849 --> 00:08:02.350
&gt;&gt; Rudy: THE PERSON IN CHARGE

00:08:02.351 --> 00:08:03.117
OF THIS INVESTIGATION, CHRIS, IS

00:08:03.118 --> 00:08:06.421
ROB ROSENSTEIN, THE DEPUTY

00:08:06.422 --> 00:08:07.088
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE

00:08:07.089 --> 00:08:07.522
UNITED STATES.

00:08:07.523 --> 00:08:08.990
HE IS THE BOSS OF MUELLER AND

00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:10.525
THE BOSS OF THE SOUTHERN

00:08:10.526 --> 00:08:11.292
DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

00:08:11.293 --> 00:08:12.226
IS THE ONE THAT DETERMINED,

00:08:12.227 --> 00:08:14.662
LET'S MOVE IT OVER HERE.

00:08:14.663 --> 00:08:16.664
HE PUT IT THERE IN THAT DISTRICT

00:08:16.665 --> 00:08:17.398
OF NEW YORK AND KEEP SUPERVISION

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:18.333
OF IT.

00:08:18.334 --> 00:08:20.568
DON'T GIVE ME THAT.

00:08:20.569 --> 00:08:23.171
THEY ARE WORKING FOR THE SAME --

00:08:23.172 --> 00:08:25.073
ROD ROSENSTEIN IS GOING TO MAKE

00:08:25.074 --> 00:08:25.807
THE DECISION, NOT MUELLER ABOUT

00:08:25.808 --> 00:08:28.343
WHAT TO DO WITH THIS CASE.

00:08:28.344 --> 00:08:29.143
&gt;&gt; Chris: RIGHT.

00:08:29.144 --> 00:08:30.778
&gt;&gt; Rudy: THIS IS A WITCH HUNT.

00:08:30.779 --> 00:08:35.183
THEY ARE GOING BACK NOW TO 1982,

00:08:35.184 --> 00:08:35.483
1983.

00:08:35.484 --> 00:08:37.185
THEY ARE GOING THROUGH BUSINESS

00:08:37.186 --> 00:08:37.518
RECORDS.

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:38.486
MY GOODNESS, THEY WENT FROM

00:08:38.487 --> 00:08:42.323
COLLUSION TO OBSTRUCTION, NO

00:08:42.324 --> 00:08:43.758
EVIDENCE.

00:08:43.759 --> 00:08:44.359
NOW CAMPAIGN FINANCE, NO

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.027
VIOLATION OF THE LAW NO MATTER

00:08:46.028 --> 00:08:47.495
WHO'S RIGHT ABOUT WHAT THEY

00:08:47.496 --> 00:08:49.430
SAID, IT'S NO VIOLATION OF THE

00:08:49.431 --> 00:08:49.864
LAW.

00:08:49.865 --> 00:08:52.967
&gt;&gt; Chris: I WANT TO MOVE ON.

00:08:52.968 --> 00:08:55.236
I'VE GOT TO MOVE ON, SIR.

00:08:55.237 --> 00:08:57.105
&gt;&gt; Rudy: YOU WANT TO THE

00:08:57.106 --> 00:08:57.405
TRUTH.

00:08:57.406 --> 00:08:57.905
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

00:08:57.906 --> 00:09:00.308
&gt;&gt; Chris: ALL RIGHT.

00:09:00.309 --> 00:09:03.411
I WANT THE TRUTH IN A LIMITED

00:09:03.412 --> 00:09:03.945
AMOUNT OF TIME.

00:09:03.946 --> 00:09:05.313
PRESIDENT TRUMP TALK THIS WEEK

00:09:05.314 --> 00:09:06.247
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

00:09:06.248 --> 00:09:06.948
GENERAL FLYNN LIED TO THE FBI,

00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:10.385
HERE HE IS.

00:09:10.386 --> 00:09:11.119
&gt;&gt; THEY TOOK A GENERAL THAT THEY

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.187
SAID DIDN'T LIE AND THEY

00:09:13.188 --> 00:09:15.123
CONVINCED HIM HE DID LIE AND

00:09:15.124 --> 00:09:17.392
THEY MADE SOME KIND OF A DEAL.

00:09:17.393 --> 00:09:19.527
AND NOW THEY ARE RECOMMENDING NO

00:09:19.528 --> 00:09:19.827
TIME.

00:09:19.828 --> 00:09:21.362
YOU KNOW WHY?

00:09:21.363 --> 00:09:22.096
BECAUSE THEY ARE EMBARRASSED BUT

00:09:22.097 --> 00:09:24.332
THEY GOT CAUGHT.

00:09:24.333 --> 00:09:25.199
&gt;&gt; Chris: DOES THE PRESIDENT

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.701
BELIEVE MICHAEL FLYNN LIED OR

00:09:26.702 --> 00:09:29.170
NOT?

00:09:29.171 --> 00:09:30.772
&gt;&gt; Rudy: I DON'T KNOW IF

00:09:30.773 --> 00:09:31.305
MICHAEL FLYNN LIED.

00:09:31.306 --> 00:09:32.140
TWO CONTRADICTORY THINGS.

00:09:32.141 --> 00:09:32.874
YOU'VE GOT THE FBI SAYING AT THE

00:09:32.875 --> 00:09:36.144
TIME THAT HE WASN'T LYING AND

00:09:36.145 --> 00:09:37.111
THEN WE HAVE NO EXPLANATION AND

00:09:37.112 --> 00:09:40.181
THE GUY PLEADS GUILTY TO LYING.

00:09:40.182 --> 00:09:41.416
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN

00:09:41.417 --> 00:09:42.617
BETWEEN.

00:09:42.618 --> 00:09:48.289
I DO KNOW THEY TREATED FLYNN IN

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:48.790
A WAY --

00:09:48.791 --> 00:09:49.957
&gt;&gt; Chris: I'M ASKING A SIMPLE

00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:50.691
QUESTION.

00:09:50.692 --> 00:09:51.893
I WANT TO PUT UP A TWEET FROM

00:09:51.894 --> 00:09:53.227
THE PRESIDENT A YEAR AGO IN

00:09:53.228 --> 00:09:55.396
DECEMBER OF 2017 WHEN HE SAYS

00:09:55.397 --> 00:09:58.599
THIS, I HAD TO FIRE GENERAL

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.333
GENERAL FLYNN BECAUSE HE LIED TO

00:09:59.334 --> 00:10:01.202
THE VICE PRESIDENT AND THE FBI.

00:10:01.203 --> 00:10:03.905
HE HAS PLED GUILTY TO THOSE LIE

00:10:03.906 --> 00:10:04.205
LIES.

00:10:04.206 --> 00:10:06.307
THE PRESIDENT A YEAR AGO SEEMED

00:10:06.308 --> 00:10:07.308
TO KNOW THAT FLYNN HAS LIED.

00:10:07.309 --> 00:10:11.012
NOW HE'S NOT SO SURE.

00:10:11.013 --> 00:10:11.746
&gt;&gt; Rudy: THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T

00:10:11.747 --> 00:10:15.383
KNOW THAT HE LIED.

00:10:15.384 --> 00:10:17.618
HE KNOWS WHAT YOU KNEW AT THE

00:10:17.619 --> 00:10:17.919
TIME.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.554
THE MAN PLED GUILTY TO LYING.

00:10:19.555 --> 00:10:22.723
&gt;&gt; Chris: NO.

00:10:22.724 --> 00:10:24.625
HE KNOWS WHAT FLYNN SAID TO HIS

00:10:24.626 --> 00:10:25.093
VICE PRESIDENT.

00:10:25.094 --> 00:10:25.927
&gt;&gt; Rudy: THAT WAS A LIE.

00:10:25.928 --> 00:10:27.562
BUT THAT'S NOT A CRIME.

00:10:27.563 --> 00:10:28.229
&gt;&gt; Chris: I UNDERSTAND.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.164
I DIDN'T ASK IF IT WAS A CRIME,

00:10:30.165 --> 00:10:32.300
I ASK WHETHER IT WAS A LIE.

00:10:32.301 --> 00:10:33.301
&gt;&gt; Rudy: YOU'RE GOING ALL OVER

00:10:33.302 --> 00:10:34.102
THE PLACE AND YOU'RE REALLY

00:10:34.103 --> 00:10:36.370
CONFUSING PEOPLE.

00:10:36.371 --> 00:10:37.305
YOU ARE.

00:10:37.306 --> 00:10:37.705
IF YOU ARE.

00:10:37.706 --> 00:10:39.140
&gt;&gt; Chris: I DIDN'T ASK WHETHER

00:10:39.141 --> 00:10:40.475
IT WAS A CRIME, I ASKED IF IT

00:10:40.476 --> 00:10:42.343
WAS A LIE AND HE TOLD THE SAME

00:10:42.344 --> 00:10:43.511
LIE TO THE FBI INTO THE

00:10:43.512 --> 00:10:45.313
VICE PRESIDENT AND YOU'RE QUITE

00:10:45.314 --> 00:10:47.982
RIGHT, LYING TO THE PRESIDENT --

00:10:47.983 --> 00:10:52.353
LYING TO THE FBI IS A CRIME.

00:10:52.354 --> 00:10:53.354
&gt;&gt; Rudy: THE MORE IMPORTANT

00:10:53.355 --> 00:10:54.388
THING ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT

00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:56.958
KNEW OR DIDN'T KNOW, BECAUSE IT

00:10:56.959 --> 00:10:57.658
DOESN'T INVOLVE THEM PRESIDENT

00:10:57.659 --> 00:10:58.759
IN TERMS OF HIM BEING INVOLVED

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.662
IN ANY KIND OF SICK CONSPIRACY.

00:11:01.663 --> 00:11:03.631
IT'S REPORTED THAT ONE OF MY

00:11:03.632 --> 00:11:04.565
ASSISTANTS WHEN I WAS THE U.S.

00:11:04.566 --> 00:11:06.534
ATTORNEY LIED TO THE COURT.

00:11:06.535 --> 00:11:09.370
HOW DO I KNOW IF YOU DID OR HE

00:11:09.371 --> 00:11:09.704
DIDN'T?

00:11:09.705 --> 00:11:11.405
HE KNOWS WHAT HE READS.

00:11:11.406 --> 00:11:14.375
THE MAN PLED GUILTY TO LYING.

00:11:14.376 --> 00:11:15.243
I DIDN'T KNOW AT THE TIME.

00:11:15.244 --> 00:11:18.679
I DIDN'T KNOW AT THE TIME BUT

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.413
THE FBI HAD PREVIOUSLY CONCLUDED

00:11:19.414 --> 00:11:21.916
THAT HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.

00:11:21.917 --> 00:11:22.884
I DIDN'T KNOW HE HAD BEEN

00:11:22.885 --> 00:11:24.886
DEPRIVED OF A LAWYER.

00:11:24.887 --> 00:11:28.022
I'M NOT CONFUSING PEOPLE.

00:11:28.023 --> 00:11:30.258
&gt;&gt; Chris: THREE LAST QUICK

00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:30.691
QUESTIONS.

00:11:30.692 --> 00:11:36.297
THERE ARE REPORTS NOW THAT THE

00:11:36.298 --> 00:11:37.765
SPECIAL COUNSEL IS INTERESTED

00:11:37.766 --> 00:11:39.467
AGAIN IN INTERVIEWING THE

00:11:39.468 --> 00:11:39.834
PRESIDENT.

00:11:39.835 --> 00:11:40.635
HESS' OFFICE REACHED OUT TO YOU

00:11:40.636 --> 00:11:41.936
ABOUT SITTING DOWN FOR AN

00:11:41.937 --> 00:11:43.604
IN-PERSON INTERVIEW WITH THE

00:11:43.605 --> 00:11:44.305
PRESIDENT?

00:11:44.306 --> 00:11:47.008
&gt;&gt; Rudy: YES, THERE ARE

00:11:47.009 --> 00:11:47.708
SEVERAL UNPAID PARKING TICKETS

00:11:47.709 --> 00:11:49.544
BACK IN 1986-87 THAT HAVEN'T

00:11:49.545 --> 00:11:54.248
BEEN EXPLAINED.

00:11:54.249 --> 00:11:55.049
&gt;&gt; Chris: SERIOUSLY.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:55.583
&gt;&gt; Rudy: SERIOUSLY.

00:11:55.584 --> 00:11:57.084
UNPAID PARKING TICKETS.

00:11:57.085 --> 00:12:00.221
&gt;&gt; Chris: IS THE SPECIAL

00:12:00.222 --> 00:12:01.189
COUNSEL WANTING TO INTERVIEW THE

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.556
PRESIDENT?

00:12:01.557 --> 00:12:02.089
&gt;&gt; Rudy: GOOD LUCK.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:03.624
AFTER WHAT THEY DID TO FLYNN,

00:12:03.625 --> 00:12:05.760
THE WAY THEY TRAPPED HIM INTO

00:12:05.761 --> 00:12:08.829
PERJURY AND NO SENTENCE FOR HIM,

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.765
14 DAYS FOR PAPADOPOULOS, I DID

00:12:10.766 --> 00:12:11.599
BETTER ON TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.302
&gt;&gt; Chris: WHEN YOU SAY GOOD

00:12:14.303 --> 00:12:16.304
LUCK, NO WAY, NO INTERVIEW?

00:12:16.305 --> 00:12:17.805
&gt;&gt; Rudy: THEY ARE A JOKE.

00:12:17.806 --> 00:12:19.473
OVER MY DEAD BODY, BUT I COULD

00:12:19.474 --> 00:12:21.876
BE DEAD.

00:12:21.877 --> 00:12:22.610
&gt;&gt; Chris: DO THEY WANT TO

00:12:22.611 --> 00:12:25.580
SPEAK TO THE PRESIDENT?

00:12:25.581 --> 00:12:29.817
WHAT THEY DID TO GENERAL FLYNN

00:12:29.818 --> 00:12:30.851
SHOULD RESULT IN DISCIPLINE.

00:12:30.852 --> 00:12:32.253
THEY ARE THE ONES WERE VIOLATING

00:12:32.254 --> 00:12:33.254
THE LAW.
