00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.577
- You can touch it if
you want, I don't care.

00:00:03.577 --> 00:00:04.660
(laughing)

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.100
- Dude, why does that
feel so natural though?

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.600
(light music)

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.103
- Hi, I'm Ilah Dizon.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.070
- Like, honestly, I've considered
cosmetic surgery before,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.183
so I don't see a problem in it.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.460
- Actually, a tummy tuck.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.010
I gained 85 pounds during
pregnancy and I lost 70 of it,

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.140
so there's a lot of loose
skin and stretch marks.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.629
You can see that.

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:33.650
Hi.
- Hi.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.162
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm John.

00:00:35.162 --> 00:00:36.850
Nice to meet you.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.758
I didn't have penis reduction surgery.

00:00:38.758 --> 00:00:40.360
(laughing)

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.920
- I mean.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.100
Is this one of those shootings

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.300
where I ask people to
take their shirts off?

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.843
- Okay, dude.

00:00:50.196 --> 00:00:51.243
(whooping)

00:00:51.243 --> 00:00:54.377
- Yep, yep.
(clapping)

00:00:54.377 --> 00:00:55.210
Work it.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.280
I think you got a boob reduction.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.100
- So I got my moobs reduced?

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.659
- I guess, yeah.

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:01.492
- All right.

00:01:01.492 --> 00:01:02.990
Okay, I have not had my breasts reduced.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.823
- Okay, okay.

00:01:03.823 --> 00:01:05.594
- But now I'm gonna think about it.

00:01:05.594 --> 00:01:06.770
(laughing)

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.506
- Dude, I'm so sorry.
- No, you're good.

00:01:08.506 --> 00:01:10.270
- It looked like a different shape.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.050
- So I pretty much just
had work done on my face.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.610
- Okay.
- And it's all just been like

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.790
pretty much like Botox
and fillers and Kybella.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.307
I got rid of my double chin.
- Dude, I need Kybella.

00:01:22.307 --> 00:01:23.140
- No, you don't.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.826
- It'll happen.
- No, you don't.

00:01:24.826 --> 00:01:26.360
- But your face is gorgeous.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.380
Why?

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.390
- Well, I think just
preventative maintenance.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.330
- Oh, got it.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.572
- I can't control my moobs
but I can control my face.

00:01:35.572 --> 00:01:37.037
- No, you don't have moobs!

00:01:37.037 --> 00:01:37.870
- I'm teasing.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:38.703
- It was nice to meet you.

00:01:38.703 --> 00:01:40.286
- Nice to meet you.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.993
- Okay, girl.

00:01:42.993 --> 00:01:44.300
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.463
- You're gorgeous.
- Oh, shut up.

00:01:45.463 --> 00:01:48.010
- You look like a Barbie.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.460
Oh my god.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.263
You already know where I'm staring.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.870
You got a boob job.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:54.941
- I got a boob job.

00:01:54.941 --> 00:01:56.390
- Yeah, she got.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.730
- So, I had a vaginoplasty done.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.750
They made my outie an innie.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.840
- Exactly.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.340
- I go back in at the end of September,

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.060
they're gonna do a second procedure.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.930
The labioplasty's kinda like
a face lift for your vagina.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:10.763
- They do that?

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:12.680
- Yeah, a lot of women who have children,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.660
actually, get labioplasties too.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.140
- Yeah, I probably should look into that.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.550
- Because loose lips.
- I'm honestly scared

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.000
they'll see what it looks like.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.820
Oh my god, I'm afraid.
(laughing)

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.680
It's so nice to meet you.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.072
- It was good meeting you.

00:02:26.072 --> 00:02:26.905
- We're twinsies.

00:02:26.905 --> 00:02:27.843
- Oh, yeah.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.800
I mean, I see scars on knees.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.670
So I wouldn't consider
surgery on the knees

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.740
or the back as cosmetic.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.340
No, I don't think she's
had cosmetic surgery.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.380
I think she's had multiple surgeries.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.860
- How many surgeries
do you think I've had?

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.670
- That was a lot of scars, I would say--

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.380
- Yeah, honestly, how many?

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.700
- At least 10.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.790
- That's a good guess.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.200
- Okay, what, how many?
- Lot more.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.270
- A lot more?

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.750
- 21.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.230
(groans)

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.160
- Holy shit.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.210
Have any of them been for cosmetic?

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.393
- Yes.
- Which ones?

00:03:00.393 --> 00:03:03.430
- I've had an orthognathic jaw surgery.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.790
I guess you could say like
facial reconstruction.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.160
And then my boobs.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.280
- Oh, well, they're gorgeous.
- I got me some, thank you.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.310
- You're amazing.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.244
- Well, so are you.

00:03:11.244 --> 00:03:12.490
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.323
(clapping)

00:03:13.323 --> 00:03:14.223
- I'm sweating.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.490
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.472
- I'm Curtis.
- Nice to meet you, Curtis.

00:03:17.472 --> 00:03:18.305
- Nice to meet you.

00:03:18.305 --> 00:03:20.833
- Just gonna do the
walk around real quick.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.980
Your lips are really plump, too.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.090
Though it could be a filler.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.560
I feel like it's lip because
they're really plump.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.890
- So, I've had nothing
done, lips are real.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.140
I use lip plumper, but
it's just like a top coat.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.406
It's like a chapstick.

00:03:36.406 --> 00:03:37.810
- What the hell?

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.240
You can do that?
- Yeah.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.770
Do you want to try some?
- Can I try some?

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.570
- Do you want to try some right now?

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.860
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.370
- Oh!

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.620
- Just gonna click it up.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.340
- Oh my god.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.920
Is this supposed to sting?

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.120
- Oh yeah.
- Oh my god!

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.800
Why didn't you warn me?

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.060
- Just wait, give it five more seconds.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.100
- Dude, this is hurting.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.470
- Doesn't it make you
want to pucker, like?

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.960
- I'm salivating, do you see it?

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.685
- Yeah, don't lick it, yeah.

00:04:03.685 --> 00:04:04.518
(laughs)

00:04:04.518 --> 00:04:05.630
Dude, she's literally drooling.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.593
- I'm drooling.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.970
- You can wipe it off, it'll come off.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.340
(laughs)

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.740
- Are you supposed to drool?

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.160
- I've never drooled like
that, but you do you, boo.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.380
- Like, is it working?

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.770
- Yeah, they look good.

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:22.603
- Really?

00:04:22.603 --> 00:04:23.860
I'm gonna be talking funny
the rest of the time,

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.010
you shoulda saved that for last.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.377
- Hi, I'm Marney, nice to meet you.

00:04:27.377 --> 00:04:29.140
- Nice to meet you.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.870
- Okay, instantly just
because it's plain as day,

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.020
you have nice breasts.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.200
- Thank you.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.570
- Okay, I don't actually
see stretch marks.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.333
Have you ever had kids?

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:41.220
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.920
Huh, are you wearing a push-up bra?

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.210
- No.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.120
- Come on.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.390
No breasts are just
naturally that perky, right?

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.220
I feel like you've got a boob job.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.053
- Yes.

00:04:51.053 --> 00:04:56.040
- Okay, and, if I might add,
did you get a tummy tuck?

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.990
Because you had kids, I'm
guessing you had a tummy tuck.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.320
I mean, that's what I would do.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.245
- Yes.
- You had a tummy tuck, too?

00:05:02.245 --> 00:05:03.970
- Yes.
(claps)

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.467
Anything else, you think I have done?

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.513
- No, I feel like it was just.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.560
Really?

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.144
Really, was it?

00:05:15.144 --> 00:05:16.410
(overlapping chattering)

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.350
I thought that was a natural, just.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.483
- Well, there was one upon a time.

00:05:20.483 --> 00:05:22.112
(laughing)

00:05:22.112 --> 00:05:23.396
- Hey, okay.

00:05:23.396 --> 00:05:24.760
(clapping)
You look amazing.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.060
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Anna.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.893
- Anna?

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.880
What is your ethnicity?

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.350
- I'm Korean.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.610
Well, part Japanese.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.420
- Part Japanese, part Korean.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.460
- Why are you asking?

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.260
- Because I'm trying to look
at facial structure right now.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.350
And then your nose, you have a bridge,

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.470
which is surprising
because a lot of Asians,

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.303
like even in my family,
we don't have bridges.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.740
No, I'm gonna guess the nose.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:50.990
- I didn't get my nose done.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.840
- Damn it.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.543
So you're all natural, aren't you?

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.213
- I am all natural now.

00:05:58.555 --> 00:06:00.720
(giggles)

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.340
- What in the hell is
that supposed to mean?

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.160
Oh, wait, wait, did you
take out breast implants?

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.993
- Yes.

00:06:06.993 --> 00:06:09.030
- Why did you choose to do that?

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.953
- To get 'em done or get 'em taken out?

00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:13.620
- To get 'em removed, yeah.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.200
- Because I didn't feel
like I was myself anymore.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.950
- Do you like your body now
more than you did before

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.670
your breast implants?

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.510
- I think I appreciate myself more.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.640
- Do you think I should get any work done?

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.240
- No, I think you're beautiful.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.840
- Thank you.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.757
Oh my gosh, yeah, so nice to meet you.

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:32.490
- Nice to meet you, too.
- Thank you so much.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.114
Oh my gosh.
- Nice to meet you.

00:06:34.114 --> 00:06:36.030
- Davion.
- Nice to meet you.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.861
I feel like this is a curveball.

00:06:38.861 --> 00:06:39.944
Twerk, twerk.

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:44.160
(laughing)

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.380
Nah, it's not the booty,
it's not the booty.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.683
Do you feel comfortable
taking off your shirt?

00:06:53.078 --> 00:06:54.380
Ah!

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.920
I see the scars.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.140
Does that mean that you
transitioned your chest

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.270
from, let's say, my chest, your chest.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.449
- That's correct, yeah.

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:06.400
Most people don't get it, but yeah.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.490
- Did you take your
innie and make an outie?

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:10.530
- Not yet.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.363
- Not yet.

00:07:11.363 --> 00:07:13.070
How would you even do that?

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.180
- It's a long process.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.190
I mean, you can, most
people use their inner arm

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.740
to make their phallus, but
I'm gonna go to the U.K.,

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.620
'cause they've recently discovered

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.990
that they can use the inner part of.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.673
- It is a time to be alive.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.531
It was so nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

00:07:33.531 --> 00:07:34.644
(clapping)

00:07:34.644 --> 00:07:36.670
- I'm gonna give you the walk around here.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.163
Girl, you already know,
you already know, okay?

00:07:41.163 --> 00:07:43.173
All right, okay?

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.600
We like big butts and we
cannot lie, all right?

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.003
You're making my ass feel smaller.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.293
- You can touch it if
you want, I don't care.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.890
That feels so weird.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.900
- Dude, why does that
feel so natural, though?

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.300
Like, you could set a cup on it.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.920
I feel like they're implants.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.770
Were they?

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:05.603
- My ass?
- Yeah.

00:08:05.603 --> 00:08:06.759
- No, my ass is not implants.

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:08.308
- What the hell?!

00:08:08.308 --> 00:08:09.141
That's real?

00:08:09.141 --> 00:08:10.670
- Yeah, my ass is real.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.145
- I'm sorry, I feel like a pervert.

00:08:13.145 --> 00:08:14.045
Um--
- It's real.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.800
(clapping)
- It was nice to meet you.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.960
- That was exciting and painful.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.780
I know what ass feels like now.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:26.270
I'm very, all about body positivity.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.290
But I don't think me wanting

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.720
to get a tummy tuck changes that.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.133
So, no, I thought this was extremely fun.

00:08:34.053 --> 00:08:35.236
(clapping)

00:08:35.236 --> 00:08:36.486
- Good job.
- Group hug!
