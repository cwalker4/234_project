00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:14.483
(Music)

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.580
(Applause)

00:01:25.695 --> 00:01:28.540
How many of you at this exact moment

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.521
are thinking about your bills
you have to pay,

00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:35.755
are thinking about the homework
assignment you have to turn in,

00:01:36.685 --> 00:01:39.885
are thinking about what you look like
and what you're wearing?

00:01:39.895 --> 00:01:41.420
How's my hair by the way?

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.024
(Laughter)

00:01:43.024 --> 00:01:44.320
No. But seriously.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.248
At this exact moment

00:01:46.248 --> 00:01:49.588
you weren't thinking about
the words that are in your head,

00:01:49.588 --> 00:01:50.986
or the stories,

00:01:50.986 --> 00:01:53.536
or the negative thoughts of fear

00:01:54.056 --> 00:01:57.146
that are happening,
that haven't yet happened.

00:01:58.756 --> 00:02:01.673
What happened when
you heard this instrument?

00:02:01.673 --> 00:02:02.921
What did you feel?

00:02:03.701 --> 00:02:05.632
What senses were engaged?

00:02:07.722 --> 00:02:12.912
This particular instrument was created
in the year 2000 in Switzerland,

00:02:13.292 --> 00:02:15.255
originally imported from outer space,

00:02:15.255 --> 00:02:16.893
I don't know how they got it here.

00:02:16.893 --> 00:02:17.910
(Laughter)

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.120
But it's here,

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.240
and the original name for it
is called the Hang.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.728
It's a particular company
from Switzerland.

00:02:28.728 --> 00:02:31.535
And this one is not the original Hang,
it's another builder.

00:02:31.535 --> 00:02:33.836
There are builders all around the world.

00:02:33.836 --> 00:02:38.276
And the reason it's called Hang
is because Hang means hand.

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.188
And hand being that it's made by hand,

00:02:42.188 --> 00:02:44.249
that it's tuned by hand,

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:47.099
(Dinging)

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.961
and it's played by hand.

00:02:50.357 --> 00:02:56.068
So what I wanted to share with you
is that this instrument has a voice,

00:02:56.068 --> 00:02:58.013
just like we all have a voice.

00:02:59.564 --> 00:03:02.519
And in that relationship
between playing an instrument,

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.902
we also have an instrument within us,
and that's our mind.

00:03:06.547 --> 00:03:10.865
And our ability to acknowledge
and notice what we're thinking,

00:03:10.865 --> 00:03:12.523
and how we react to the thoughts

00:03:12.523 --> 00:03:15.733
that are happening and streaming
through us like Wi-Fi,

00:03:16.233 --> 00:03:17.216
it's constant.

00:03:18.094 --> 00:03:19.204
So I'm sitting here

00:03:19.204 --> 00:03:23.265
and thinking about my first time
that I first experienced the handpan,

00:03:23.265 --> 00:03:25.968
and it was while I was living
in the Netherlands.

00:03:25.968 --> 00:03:28.643
And I was walking down the street
and I heard this sound,

00:03:28.643 --> 00:03:31.495
and it just pulled me,
literally, like a rope,

00:03:32.405 --> 00:03:36.005
you know, being towed all the way up
from an anchor in the sea.

00:03:37.075 --> 00:03:39.736
I was drawn to this sound, this vibration.

00:03:40.491 --> 00:03:45.002
I sat there and, in awe, just watched,
watched this person playing.

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:50.947
And I thought about how much
I wanted to experience that for myself.

00:03:50.947 --> 00:03:54.143
What was drawing me into this sound?
Did you experience that at all?

00:03:54.685 --> 00:03:57.028
Did you feel connected to it?

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:59.594
So the idea was that happened to me too.

00:04:00.064 --> 00:04:02.898
And as I had searched and seeked
over the last few months,

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.725
I have found one for sale.

00:04:06.615 --> 00:04:11.779
They're not an easy instrument to acquire
and they're expensive as well.

00:04:12.256 --> 00:04:15.235
So for me, the first time
I had experienced one,

00:04:15.235 --> 00:04:19.541
I figured, I have to play this
immediately in a yoga class,

00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:22.301
I don't have time to practice.

00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:24.828
I don't have time to practice

00:04:24.828 --> 00:04:26.835
because if I sit there
and try to practice,

00:04:26.835 --> 00:04:31.795
it could be weeks, months, years later
before I actually play it in class.

00:04:31.795 --> 00:04:36.588
So I bought it within the first week.

00:04:37.237 --> 00:04:39.462
As soon as I was able
to teach another class,

00:04:39.462 --> 00:04:40.806
I took it into class.

00:04:41.225 --> 00:04:45.728
And you wouldn't believe the stories
that were going on in my head.

00:04:45.728 --> 00:04:47.476
People are going to think I suck.

00:04:47.476 --> 00:04:49.457
Everyone's going to know.

00:04:49.457 --> 00:04:52.271
And the thing is,
those were just stories, right?

00:04:52.926 --> 00:04:55.196
Because they haven't happened yet.

00:04:55.196 --> 00:04:58.737
But why do we seem to believe the stories
that haven't happened yet?

00:04:59.353 --> 00:05:01.767
Because they're not true, is that right?

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:06.429
What if your favorite song came on,
you're with a group of people,

00:05:06.429 --> 00:05:08.469
some are friends,
some are different people

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:10.274
just out and about maybe in public.

00:05:10.274 --> 00:05:12.052
Your favorite song, mind you.

00:05:12.577 --> 00:05:15.088
Don't be shy, your favorite song.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.155
The song comes on,

00:05:17.155 --> 00:05:20.375
and you normally scream this song
at the top of your lungs, at home.

00:05:21.245 --> 00:05:23.519
But yet, you're just going like this,

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:25.139
"God, this is my favorite song,

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.519
it's my jam."

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.930
But then suddenly, you stop
because the voices in the head say:

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.300
Don't do it. You're going
to look like an idiot.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.797
And here's another example,
what if you had ...

00:05:40.846 --> 00:05:44.476
Maybe you're sitting in a class,
or you're at the office or work,

00:05:44.476 --> 00:05:45.971
and you're asked a question.

00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:50.018
And there's a group of people,
and you know the answer to that question.

00:05:50.018 --> 00:05:52.195
But yet, you don't raise your hand.

00:05:52.195 --> 00:05:54.281
Because maybe that question,

00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:56.667
maybe the answer
is not what you thought it was.

00:05:56.667 --> 00:05:59.855
Or maybe you actually know the question
and you know the answer;

00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:02.590
and you don't want other people to know,

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.766
"What gosh, the same person
always answers the questions."

00:06:05.766 --> 00:06:06.837
Either way,

00:06:07.687 --> 00:06:09.417
we're in a conundrum.

00:06:10.017 --> 00:06:12.397
We're stuck with a battle in the mind.

00:06:13.297 --> 00:06:14.868
So what I'm sharing with you is:

00:06:14.868 --> 00:06:17.136
this took you
out of your mind, did it not?

00:06:17.676 --> 00:06:19.304
Where did it bring you?

00:06:20.233 --> 00:06:21.721
Here? Maybe here?

00:06:22.171 --> 00:06:24.402
Something that you've never
experienced before?

00:06:24.852 --> 00:06:28.726
How many people here have not seen
this instrument or heard it live?

00:06:30.155 --> 00:06:32.696
Ok, that is everyone but the kids
that we coached.

00:06:32.696 --> 00:06:35.416
(Laughter)

00:06:35.416 --> 00:06:37.192
So, think of it like this.

00:06:38.528 --> 00:06:39.868
In my experience,

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.827
if I were then to ask you:

00:06:43.157 --> 00:06:47.991
how many of you in the room
would like to share their experience,

00:06:48.511 --> 00:06:50.122
stand up on the stage,

00:06:52.492 --> 00:06:55.742
of what you felt from this instrument
and it being played?

00:06:55.742 --> 00:06:59.173
How about you on the top
with the long black hair?

00:06:59.506 --> 00:07:00.720
Oh no, no, wait, wait.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.250
How about you with the black shoes,
right around here?

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.209
No. How about you here with the glasses?

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.445
Wait a second.

00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:10.989
Did you just get nervous?

00:07:12.486 --> 00:07:14.484
I can't even see anything right now.

00:07:14.484 --> 00:07:16.744
(Laughter)

00:07:16.744 --> 00:07:18.984
So why did you feel like that?

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:23.385
My words flowed over to you,

00:07:23.385 --> 00:07:25.705
you heard them,
processed in the processor.

00:07:25.705 --> 00:07:27.481
Pentium, whatever it is now.

00:07:28.492 --> 00:07:33.522
And now, you started to feel
uncomfortable - maybe, maybe not.

00:07:34.613 --> 00:07:37.523
And in that, I started to control,

00:07:38.743 --> 00:07:43.023
a little bit manipulate,
shift your thought process

00:07:43.023 --> 00:07:45.802
because you weren't here, you were here.

00:07:45.802 --> 00:07:47.144
Is that right?

00:07:47.664 --> 00:07:54.672
So, if that is true and this instrument
that plays music can be tuned,

00:07:54.672 --> 00:07:59.844
I started to realize and shift my ideas
of how I would go through life.

00:08:00.984 --> 00:08:02.745
And this is my idea.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.328
I believe passionately

00:08:06.128 --> 00:08:08.483
that we can shift the negative voices

00:08:09.445 --> 00:08:13.776
and stories that are going on
in our minds into positive ones.

00:08:15.415 --> 00:08:16.984
How do you do that?

00:08:17.825 --> 00:08:20.185
Well, there's three main questions.

00:08:20.535 --> 00:08:23.777
The first question is: is it the truth?

00:08:25.946 --> 00:08:29.628
Is whatever I'm sharing with someone,
or what you're hearing from someone else

00:08:29.628 --> 00:08:32.958
that's giving you feedback
about your life, true?

00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.996
You know a 100% that it's true.

00:08:34.996 --> 00:08:36.198
First question.

00:08:36.198 --> 00:08:37.485
Second question:

00:08:38.826 --> 00:08:40.198
is it necessary?

00:08:41.107 --> 00:08:45.266
Is what I'm saying to myself in my head,
is it necessary in the exact moment,

00:08:45.266 --> 00:08:47.783
in what I'm doing
with my life, right then?

00:08:48.376 --> 00:08:50.086
And the third question is:

00:08:51.276 --> 00:08:53.592
does it improve upon the silence?

00:08:59.826 --> 00:09:01.401
This instrument is so powerful

00:09:01.401 --> 00:09:04.073
that it improved
upon the silence of the room.

00:09:04.645 --> 00:09:06.143
You could feel it,

00:09:06.143 --> 00:09:07.545
you could see it,

00:09:07.545 --> 00:09:10.750
and then once you see and feel,
you started to know.

00:09:12.011 --> 00:09:13.011
So here I am,

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:17.883
and I'm thinking about the first time
that I was going through my ideas

00:09:17.883 --> 00:09:19.474
in creating my lifestyle.

00:09:20.689 --> 00:09:24.099
I, being very similar
to the students at NIST,

00:09:24.099 --> 00:09:25.719
was educated

00:09:25.719 --> 00:09:30.177
and around a lot of very creative people
that influenced me in a positive way,

00:09:30.177 --> 00:09:35.698
which is just north of San Francisco,
and a city-county called Marin.

00:09:36.428 --> 00:09:37.880
And growing up there,

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.809
the people that I was around
helped shift my mind to believe

00:09:42.419 --> 00:09:44.765
before I even knew it was possible.

00:09:45.447 --> 00:09:48.522
So I was thinking of and creating
within the same age range

00:09:48.522 --> 00:09:52.426
as most of you, around 15,16,
when I first started practicing yoga.

00:09:52.816 --> 00:09:55.532
And at that time, I didn't really know
what was going on

00:09:55.532 --> 00:09:58.322
because I was really focused on sports.

00:10:00.532 --> 00:10:03.552
Yeah, other things, you know
what I'm talking about.

00:10:03.552 --> 00:10:05.961
So, what ended up happening was

00:10:05.961 --> 00:10:08.481
I started creating
this idea of this lifestyle

00:10:08.481 --> 00:10:12.167
where I could travel around the world,
learn as much as I can,

00:10:12.167 --> 00:10:15.141
teach what I was learning,
and pass it on.

00:10:16.122 --> 00:10:17.992
How was I going to do that?

00:10:18.862 --> 00:10:25.130
In the last 5 years, as I was traveling,
pretty much since 2002, consistently,

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:29.312
every year I've been back to Thailand
for the last 14-15 years.

00:10:29.312 --> 00:10:31.336
And the reason that I come back

00:10:31.336 --> 00:10:35.220
is to study, is to practice,
is to breathe,

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.510
is to learn about myself.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.596
I mean, it's rare
that you have a 21-year-old

00:10:41.596 --> 00:10:45.353
go off to a monastery
for ten days and be silent

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:47.683
when all their friends
are in college playing.

00:10:48.383 --> 00:10:52.362
So, there was something there
that kept pulling me back here.

00:10:52.362 --> 00:10:56.080
And at that time, I created
what's called Pranaforce yoga.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.867
And Pranaforce is our company.

00:11:00.028 --> 00:11:05.274
And the whole idea
or our vision mantra is: dream it real.

00:11:06.779 --> 00:11:08.918
Live your dreams, make it happen,

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:11.027
just do it, right now,

00:11:11.627 --> 00:11:14.127
as if it was already happening.

00:11:14.407 --> 00:11:16.006
So I had to really shift my mind,

00:11:16.006 --> 00:11:18.631
and as I shared the story
with other friends and family,

00:11:18.631 --> 00:11:20.128
you know what, I was so excited

00:11:20.128 --> 00:11:23.287
that I thought everyone
would also believe in me.

00:11:23.737 --> 00:11:25.324
But what I found out was,

00:11:26.074 --> 00:11:27.492
it wasn't that.

00:11:28.423 --> 00:11:30.405
Some really close friends,

00:11:32.462 --> 00:11:34.379
some really close family,

00:11:34.912 --> 00:11:38.812
did not see or believe in
what I was seeing and believing.

00:11:39.447 --> 00:11:41.070
So, this is what happened.

00:11:42.253 --> 00:11:44.113
They'd say, "Wow this is a great idea,

00:11:44.113 --> 00:11:47.229
but here's a long list of things
why that won't work."

00:11:48.442 --> 00:11:51.872
And I thought,
"Wow, oh my gosh, really?

00:11:52.609 --> 00:11:53.789
Is that true?

00:11:55.129 --> 00:11:56.453
Is that necessary?

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.699
Is that improving me help live my dreams?"

00:12:01.849 --> 00:12:03.743
So what I started to realize,

00:12:04.357 --> 00:12:07.453
is that a lot of people
are going to share with you ideas,

00:12:07.453 --> 00:12:11.975
I have no idea what your experience is
within work, education, anything.

00:12:12.469 --> 00:12:14.257
But let me tell you this,

00:12:14.257 --> 00:12:16.640
if you share something
with me personally,

00:12:17.491 --> 00:12:19.701
that is not where I wish to be,

00:12:19.701 --> 00:12:24.793
relationship-wise, business-wise,
finance-wise, spirit-wise,

00:12:24.793 --> 00:12:28.735
doesn't matter what it is,
I don't have to believe you.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:31.641
I can agree with you,

00:12:31.641 --> 00:12:34.686
I can nod my head and say,
"Yes, you know I totally understand."

00:12:34.686 --> 00:12:37.861
But I don't have to believe you
because once I start to believe you

00:12:37.861 --> 00:12:39.581
that can shift the whole chemistry 

00:12:39.581 --> 00:12:41.018
in my mind.

00:12:41.018 --> 00:12:42.678
Because the thing is this,

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.858
the subconscious mind
and the conscious mind

00:12:45.858 --> 00:12:49.504
don't know the difference
between negative and positive energy.

00:12:51.324 --> 00:12:52.858
It just knows it as energy.

00:12:53.797 --> 00:12:55.207
So the subconscious mind,

00:12:55.207 --> 00:13:00.110
if we're saying things to someone,
"You'll never be able to do that."

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.707
That person's subconscious mind - mine -

00:13:02.707 --> 00:13:08.796
will say, "Wait, I can't? Oh Gosh.
OK, put that away."

00:13:08.796 --> 00:13:12.972
But the conscious mind, educated,
smart, very cerebral will say,

00:13:13.632 --> 00:13:16.377
"Wait no, I'm smarter than that, wait."

00:13:17.077 --> 00:13:19.605
I can stop that as long as I'm aware.

00:13:20.267 --> 00:13:21.989
How do we become more aware?

00:13:21.989 --> 00:13:24.971
We have to question the thoughts
and the stories or the voices

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:27.003
that we have within our mind.

00:13:27.003 --> 00:13:29.233
If you do not, it's fine.

00:13:29.891 --> 00:13:33.800
You'll be probably
very successful, super happy,

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.177
maybe even being of service
on this planet right now.

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:42.186
But, if there is something
that you're passionate about,

00:13:44.607 --> 00:13:45.886
that you love,

00:13:47.373 --> 00:13:48.534
a dream,

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.146
live it!

00:13:51.813 --> 00:13:52.773
Van Gogh,

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.063
an incredible artist from the Netherlands,

00:13:56.063 --> 00:13:57.881
Vincent van Gogh, said,

00:13:57.881 --> 00:14:04.571
"If you have voices in your mind
that say that you cannot paint,

00:14:04.571 --> 00:14:06.416
by all means paint,

00:14:07.617 --> 00:14:09.630
and that voice will be silenced."

00:14:11.479 --> 00:14:12.779
The idea is this,

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:18.249
only we can conceptualize and understand
what's going on in our mind.

00:14:18.249 --> 00:14:20.548
So only we can really acknowledge it

00:14:20.548 --> 00:14:22.761
and start to notice
if it's a benefit to us.

00:14:23.691 --> 00:14:25.313
So I'm sitting here, standing,

00:14:25.313 --> 00:14:29.193
sharing with all these other people
that are also sharing about voices,

00:14:29.193 --> 00:14:33.362
the voices aren't just audible,
talked spoken voices,

00:14:33.362 --> 00:14:35.862
these are voices within the mind.

00:14:35.862 --> 00:14:38.580
The mind, maybe the hearts,
may be other people.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.523
So we have to see it's not
just what we speak,

00:14:41.523 --> 00:14:44.636
but it's how we speak it,
it's when we speak it,

00:14:45.085 --> 00:14:47.688
and all these things
that come in, cumulative,

00:14:47.688 --> 00:14:49.328
that really make a difference.

00:14:49.788 --> 00:14:51.300
So, at this point now,

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.350
as I've been sharing
and teaching and traveling

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:57.196
I've had more opportunity
to connect with people.

00:14:57.755 --> 00:15:01.804
But the biggest thing that I've found
is the connection with myself.

00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:05.513
If I'm not connecting with myself
in any given place,

00:15:05.513 --> 00:15:09.050
my mind will be off, my heart will be off
in other distant places.

00:15:09.727 --> 00:15:13.337
And there's a lot of distractions
around us all the time, as we know.

00:15:14.208 --> 00:15:17.434
So I want to share with you
one short, small session,

00:15:17.434 --> 00:15:20.237
so you get another feel
of this instrument.

00:15:21.243 --> 00:15:24.750
And as you go through
this experience this time,

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.270
I'd like to invite you to close your eyes.

00:15:29.418 --> 00:15:32.403
Now, what senses do we know that we have?

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:37.770
A sense of sight, smell, taste,
sound, and touch.

00:15:39.047 --> 00:15:40.797
Take away the eyes.

00:15:41.769 --> 00:15:43.420
Give yourself just a moment.

00:15:44.208 --> 00:15:48.013
You can leave them cracked open if you're
just a little bit weird, that's fine.

00:15:52.088 --> 00:15:55.778
As you close your eyes here,
give yourself a moment to breathe,

00:15:57.569 --> 00:15:59.287
and feel what you feel,

00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:03.219
with no wonder or interpretation
as to what's going on.

00:16:05.375 --> 00:16:09.633
If there's anything within that space
within you, that you feel drawn to,

00:16:09.633 --> 00:16:13.398
just notice the thoughts,
acknowledge them, right?

00:16:13.398 --> 00:16:17.989
Like clouds in the sky, you cannot hook on
a cloud and keep it forever.

00:16:17.989 --> 00:16:19.398
It has to pass.

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:25.770
(Playing the Hang)

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:20.273
One of the most influential teachers

00:17:21.913 --> 00:17:23.073
in my life

00:17:24.178 --> 00:17:26.758
is from India, his name is Sai Baba.

00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:30.691
And the questions, the three questions,

00:17:31.573 --> 00:17:34.046
that I had asked you to ask yourself

00:17:34.046 --> 00:17:39.726
when those negative emotions and thoughts
arise, or stories, was from this quote:

00:17:40.774 --> 00:17:42.950
"Is what we speak the truth?

00:17:43.968 --> 00:17:45.373
Is it necessary?

00:17:46.397 --> 00:17:48.619
Does it improve upon the silence?"

00:17:50.226 --> 00:17:51.472
Namaste.

00:17:51.472 --> 00:17:52.972
(Applause)
