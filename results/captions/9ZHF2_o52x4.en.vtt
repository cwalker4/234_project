00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.040
It's late spring of the year 1940.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:24.780
Following the rapid overwhelming of France and Low Countries (which gained Germany an unchallenged position in continental Europe)

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.900
Hitler now attempts to knock the last major power in Europe out of the war.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.660
Yet the ensuing battle for domination over British skies

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.980
proved the valour of the Royal Air Force pilots and capability of British industry,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.020
resulting in a first major defeat for the German war machine.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.040
Independent from these air operations above the English Channel and British soil,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:56.060
the German Kriegsmarine challenged the mighty power of the Royal Navy over its long-standing hegemony at sea.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.700
This daunting task was of vital importance to the Germans,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.860
as Great Britain (though a global power) being an island nation was heavily dependent on imported goods and raw materials.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.640
Thousands of commerce vessels crossed the Atlantic every month

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.560
helping to keep the British economy running and both directly and indirectly supporting its war effort.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.400
Of course the Germans were fully aware of this vulnerability

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:29.340
and since the war broke out in 1939 one of the main tasks of the considerably weaker, but rapidly expanding Kriegsmarine

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.860
was to undermine British sea commerce and thus hinder its military industry and economic potential.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.500
This spanning sea campaign, known today as the Battle of the Atlantic, lasted for nearly six years

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.020
and had a crucial impact on the war in Europe.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.820
It is to this backdrop that our story unfolds.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:59.420
It is the 21st March of 1941, two German battleships – the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau sail back to the port of Brest

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.540
following their moderately successful sixty day long raid on Allied trading lanes.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.300
This action served two purposes:

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:15.180
The tying down of a significant portion of the British Home Fleet with the presence of German capital ships loose on the Northern Atlantic.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.200
And also to serve as support for a small, yet deathly effective u-boat fleet

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.740
which at the time was highly successful performing its mission to hunt down Allied merchant convoys crossing the Atlantic.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.000
The German Naval Command under Grand Admiral Erich Raeder was pleased with the results of the sortie,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.080
which either captured  or destroyed 22 ships and immediately decided to carry out yet another commerce raid,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.680
but this time utilizing all four modern German battleships.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:56.200
Such force operating on the Atlantic could pose a formidable threat not only to allied commerce convoys but even for the British Royal Navy.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.980
But this plan, dubbed "Operation Rheinübung" faced certain difficulties from the onset.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.980
Both Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were out of action for at least several months due to engine and torpedo damage respectively,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.820
while the newest battleship – the Tirpitz was still undergoing crew training.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.880
This meant that the only fully operational capital ship at the time

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.300
was the pride of the German Navy and leading ship of her class – the Bismarck.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.120
Grand Admiral Raeder was determined to have his capital ships raiding the Atlantic convoys as soon as possible,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:41.020
because he wanted to avoid the expected cuts on the naval budget in light of the upcoming German invasion of the Soviet Union,

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.900
where the Kriegsmarine wouldn't play any significant role.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.120
He opposed the idea of opening the Eastern Front,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.920
believing that it was United Kingdom which posed the greater threat to German hegemony in Europe.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.460
Regardless, preparations for the Bismarck's sortie into the Atlantic began.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.080
The only other serviceable ship with enough endurance for such a mission was the Prinz Eugen,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.880
an Admiral Hipper class heavy cruiser, which was subsequently added to the Bismarck's task force.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:23.100
Raeder appointed trustworthy admiral Gunther Lütjens to take command of "Operation Rheinübung" who soon raised his flag on the Bismarck.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:31.180
Raeder wanted to begin the operation in late April, during a new moon period and with favourable low-visibility conditions.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:38.800
However, due to a couple of issues with the Prinz Eugen, both ships remained in port until the middle of May.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:45.240
Worth mentioning is that Lütjens tried to change Raeder's mind regarding the upcoming sortie

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:52.520
and he advised Raeder to wait until at least one of the three unavailable capital ships could join the Bismarck's mission.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.560
Lütjens, more than anyone else, was aware of the danger the sortie could spark

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:04.100
as he had commanded Scharnhorst and Gneisenau's successful Atlantic raid months earlier.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.660
Yet Raeder was unable to yield to Lütjens’ wishes

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:14.760
and he instead convinced Lütjens of the necessity of the presence of German capital ships on the Atlantic,

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.100
even if it meant just one battleship would be involved in this operation.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:28.800
Late in the evening of the 18th of May, Prinz Eugen departed Gotenhafen and five hours later was followed by the Bismarck.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.600
Both ships rendezvoused in the Western Baltic, and, with the assistance of three destroyers,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.740
they steamed through the Great Belt heading to the Norwegian Sea.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.360
Yet Lütjens’ operation didn’t remain unnoticed for too long.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:50.120
While passing through Kattegat, the German battle group was sighted by a Swedish seaplane cruiser.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:57.240
A day later, while refuelling in a fjord near Bergen, was sighted by a British reconnaissance Spitfire.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.900
Lütjens expected that the British could already know that the Bismarck was off port,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.880
but the German air reconnaissance reports that he received on the 22nd of May

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:14.060
stated that the Royal Navy ships were still anchored in Scapa Flow naval base in the Orkneys.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:21.580
This information possibly dispelled Lütjens doubts and he led both ships to the Denmark Strait,

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:28.560
hoping that worsening weather would help the German ships to break out into the Atlantic unseen.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:36.440
In the evening of the 23rd of May, they reached the ice limit and set course along Greenland’s coast.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:45.200
Though the Denmark strait was officially 200 nautical miles wide, in late spring it was still considerably obstructed by pack ice,

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.300
which basically halved its effective width.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:56.100
Soon, despite bad weather and low visibility, the German battle group encountered the HMS Suffolk,

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:01.140
a British heavy cruiser equipped with a new type of radar that was tracking them.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:08.160
She soon took cover in the fog, but it was clear for Lütjens that their operation was no longer a secret

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.420
and that the intelligence reports of a few days earlier were false.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:19.620
An hour later the Bismarck spotted another heavy cruiser to its port side –  the HMS Norfolk

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.820
– and Lütjens gave the command to open fire immediately.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.500
Five salvos were fired, but none of them scored a direct hit.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:38.120
Despite this, the Norfolk was unable to fight on equal terms with the much stronger warship, so she set a smokescreen and retreated into the fog.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:44.680
Still, thanks to the Suffolk’s radar, the British cruisers were able to trace the German group.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:52.940
Lütjens was informed that the Bismarck’s radar was malfunctioning due to the force of the blasts from her own powerful artillery.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.960
As a result, he ordered the Prinz Eugen to take the lead.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.000
At this point, he could have tried to turn back and retreat to the Norwegian Sea,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.680
but, being encouraged by the bad weather, he decided to continue the mission and steam south west,

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.840
hoping to shake off the British cruisers during the night.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:21.920
Lütjens anticipated that the Royal Navy’s capital ships were either too far away to intercept his task force or were still anchoring in Scapa Flow.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.240
It was a risky, but still viable, plan.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.080
Unfortunately, the bad news was still coming.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:37.680
Six hours later, at dawn, Prinz Eugen’s hydrophones detected the propeller noises of two ships on her port side.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:43.160
Lütjens expected another two British cruisers, but as these warships got closer,

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:49.200
he realised from the size of their superstructures that heavier units were about to challenge him.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:57.920
Vice-admiral Lancelot Holland was approaching the German battle group with a force consisting of two capital ships in the lead:

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.980
the mighty battlecruiser HMS Hood, the pride of the Royal Navy

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.160
and a brand new battleship, the HMS Prince of Wales.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:13.280
The reason behind Holland’s aggressive course lay in the characteristics of the Hood’s armour.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:19.100
Though her main belt armour was thick, the deck received relatively little protection,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:26.760
leaving the ship vulnerable in long-distance exchanges where the plunging fire could easily penetrate the armour of her deck.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.640
Being over 12 miles away, the British ships opened fire with their forward turrets.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.180
While the Prince of Wales correctly tracked the more dangerous threat of the Bismarck,

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:45.280
the Hood mistakenly aimed at the Prinz Eugen, which was leading the line and had quite a similar silhouette to the Bismarck’s.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:52.200
British initial salvoes missed and soon the Prince of Wales had to fight with malfunctioning armaments,

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.780
a somewhat expected teething pain.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:10:02.580
In the meantime, the Hood’s next salvoes were much closer, throwing splinters across the Prinz Eugen’s boards.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:11.160
But the German guns remained silent. Lütjens was reluctant to return fire, even though it seemed that engagement was unavoidable.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:18.960
He still had Raeder’s orders in mind, which urged him to avoid encounters with equal British units at all costs

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.920
as his primary mission was commerce raiding,

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.360
but it seemed that there’s no way out.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.500
His artillery officers made a number of requests to open fire,

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:35.740
but Lütjens first took the time to ensure that both of his ships’ armaments were aiming at the Hood

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.700
and then waited until the optimal moment to strike.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:49.240
Eventually, the Bismarck’s guns roared in a full broadside fire followed by the Prinz Eugen’s salvo shortly thereafter.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.480
The initial fire yielded immediate results,

00:10:52.660 --> 00:11:00.460
as the Prinz Eugen scored a direct hit on the Hood with a high explosive shell causing a substantial fire on boards.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:08.840
At this point, the British shells of the Prince of Wales finally reached the Bismarck, penetrating her bow and causing a fuel leak.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.020
The Germans still held the advantage, firing full broadsides

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:20.920
while the Prince of Wales used just half of her guns and the Hood still mistakenly concentrating her fire on the Prinz Eugen.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:30.280
Vice-admiral Holland ordered both of his ships to turn to port so all British guns could shoot at the Germans thus equalizing the encounter,

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.320
but virtually a minute later the unexpected happened.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:40.140
From a distance just short of 9 miles, the Bismarck’s fifth salvo reached its target

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:45.280
and one or more shells penetrated the Hood’s deck, seemingly without effect.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.500
British gunnery officers believed it was a dud,

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:54.300
but seconds later an enormous magazine explosion tore the mighty Hood in two.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:12:01.340
The explosive effect of the Bismarck’s momentous direct hit left German sailors staring in awe,

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.020
but admiral Lütjens remained calm and unmoved.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:13.180
Within next three minutes the blazing pride of the Royal Navy and for a long time the biggest warship of the world,

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.700
disappeared from the ocean’s surface.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:21.700
She sunk with her entire 1,400 men crew. Just three seamen survived.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.060
But the battle didn’t end.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.480
The Prince of Wales adjusted her course to avoid the sinking wreck of the Hood

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:36.000
and soon suffered concentrated fire from both of the German units which were both well positioned to switch targets.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:45.460
The distance between all opponents decreased, allowing even the Prinz Eugen to fire its secondary armament and prepare torpedo tubes.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:51.940
Both of Lütjens’ warships scored hits on the remaining British unit, causing medium damage.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:58.460
The Prince of Wales, clearly at a huge disadvantage, launched a smoke screen and began to retreat.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:06.300
A few more salvoes were fired by both sides as the distance between the enemies increased, but none reached their targets.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:12.020
The short, yet shattering Battle of the Denmark Strait thus came to an end.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:19.040
While the Prinz Eugen was essentially intact, not having been hit in the battle, the Bismarck was damaged.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:27.320
Her speed was slightly reduced due to the flooding of one of her boiler rooms and suffered a slight list to the bow and port side.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.720
What was more worrying was that one of the British shells had ruptured her bow,

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:37.940
causing flooding of one of the forecastle tanks and causing her to slowly leak precious fuel.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.860
Lütjens was considering his options.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:46.020
He was aware that the British would seek revenge for the loss of their symbolic battlecruiser,

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:55.180
but he didn’t know that the Royal Navy had employed the majority of its available warships to seek and destroy the German task force.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.120
The hunt for the Bismarck was about to begin.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.020
The hunt for the Bismarck has begun!

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:10.900
