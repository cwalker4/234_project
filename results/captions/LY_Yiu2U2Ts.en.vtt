00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.140
If you zoom in to Morocco, you'll see a
tiny wedge of land that stands out from

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.500
its surroundings. This little bit of land
is surrounded by one of the most

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.540
fortified borders on the planet.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.860
Right outside the border you'll find makeshift

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.580
forest camps, where people spend their
days and nights evading the police and

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.410
preparing to rush the border, usually in
large groups, with hopes of jumping over

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.700
and stepping foot on this land.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.640
This peculiar scene plays out because
this piece of land, while in the

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.840
continent of Africa, is actually a piece
of Europe.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.680
This small piece of land is called Melilla.
It's one of two Spanish enclaves in

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.820
Morocco, marking the only borders that
Europe shares with the continent of Africa.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.580
Spain conquered Melilla in the late
1400s as part of its rapid global expansion.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.140
This region of northern Africa
changed hands many times over the

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.140
following decades, but Spain kept hold of
Melilla.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.580
Even in 1956, when the colonial

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.180
period was winding down and great powers
were ceding their colonies, Morocco had just

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.060
declared independence, but even then
Spain held onto its enclave.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.600
Today, around 86,000 people live in Melilla
and when you're there you might as well

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.350
be in mainland Spain. The city is
designed with the distinctive Spanish

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.700
architectural style and residents speak
Spanish. They pay in Euros.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.680
You're only reminded that you're not in mainland
Europe when you walk to the peripheries

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.700
of this city, to find one of the most
fortified border walls on the planet.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.880
A seven mile barrier with layers of
protection

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.440
The first layer is a 20-foot metal fence,
followed by a second fence with a

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.950
flexible top, which makes it harder to
climb. Below this second fence you have

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.240
barbed wire netting, strong and dense
webs, then comes another taller fence

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.680
with a flexible top section and more
barbed wire. Then you're on the Moroccan

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.760
side where, you have a 6.5
foot ditch and then a double fence with

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.140
you guessed it, more barbed wire. There
are lookout posts and every inch of the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.900
border is monitored by video
surveillance.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.070
To understand why this

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.180
barrier exists, you have to cross over
into the Moroccan town of Nador and

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.550
then into the forest in the hills
surrounding the enclave.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.460
These migrants are mostly from
sub-Saharan Africa and they all have

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.620
different motives for leaving their
homelands.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.020
They gather in these camps and

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.820
plan for the day when they'll try to
cross into Melilla.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.440
In response to this intense security, the migrants have

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.940
developed a technique that relies on
overpowering the border guards with

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.320
strength of numbers.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.900
The groups range in
size, but are nearly always in the

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.490
hundreds. Most get caught right away on
the Moroccan side where they face border

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.390
agents who are not shy about using force.
Those who make it past the first few

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.780
layers, onto the Spanish section of the
barrier are also thrown back immediately

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.160
or detained, but because of their large
numbers a few will inevitably slip past

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.700
the guards. As soon as they put their
feet on the ground in Melilla, they are

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.480
technically in Europe and are guaranteed
certain protections under European Union law.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.350
But they still have to run a hundred
meters to an immigration center, where

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.460
they can be taken in and given
protection from immediate deportation.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.520
Arrivals to these enclaves came to a
head in 2014, when Spain decided it was

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.180
finally time to double down on its
effort to fortify this border. This was

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.810
mainly in response to the influx of
migrants attempting to get into Europe,

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.960
fleeing from conflicts in Africa and the
Middle East.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.960
"Biggest wave refugees in modern history"

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.340
"hundreds of thousands of refugees"

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.949
"fleeing brutal violence in the Middle
East"

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:50.920
"cross over European borders by the
hundreds of thousands"

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.100
"in overcrowded boats, many drowning along the way"

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.520
Spain's response to this migration

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.120
crisis was to focus on the borders of
its enclaves in Africa, redoubling the

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.050
efforts to keep migrants out of this
little slice of Europe. The year after

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.560
the 2014 migration crisis, attempts to
jump the fence dropped by 67%.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.860
Spain didn't make these numbers drop on their
own. One of the things you'll notice when

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.669
you look at this wall, is that Moroccan
military and police are also guarding

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.659
this border. The year of the migration
crisis, Morocco built these two extra

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:24.460
layers of barbed wire fencing.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.520
"But authorities say dense new anticlimb mesh

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.660
stopped the latest to make the attempt
in their tracks"

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.349
So why would Morocco

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:37.560
take the responsibility of building a
barrier and standing guard at Spain's border?

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.080
Turns out they have real
incentives to do so. Morocco has what's

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.680
called advanced status partnership with
Europe, which gives them economic and

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.550
political advantages in trade and
political affairs. The European Union

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.300
accounts for more than half of Morocco's
international trade and the EU also

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.529
provides Morocco with billions of Euros
in aid for security and development, so

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:59.620
the Moroccans in an effort to stay on
good terms with their northern neighbor,

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.080
take on the job of protecting Spain's
border. And they take their job very seriously.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.060
Migrants had always had their forest camps right here,
right outside the city on this hill.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:44.820
This was their camp for years and this
is the place where they used to regroup

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.020
and prepare a jump, until just a few
months ago when the Moroccan military

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.520
set up an outpost up here.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.120
Now the migrants can't return and they have gone

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:01.380
to find another refuge, which is on a
hill 12 kilometers from here. Moroccan authorities

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.020
have started routinely raiding the camps.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.500
But they don't deport them from
Morocco, they have other less

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.980
resource-intensive ways of keeping these
migrants from coordinating a large

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.730
enough group for a jump. The police were
here for three hours this morning, they

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:25.170
basically came in and stole a bunch of
stuff, they kind of disrupted these tents

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:31.410
and messed with these people's houses.
They harassed the women in violent ways.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.370
They basically came here just to flex
their muscles and say you know we're in

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.960
charge, make sure you remember that.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.160
About once a month the Moroccan authorities

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:44.520
round up the migrants and send them to
other parts of Morocco that are far away

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.760
from Melillah, preventing them from
gathering in a sufficient group to blitz the fence.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.860
The Moroccan authorities are not concerned with keeping these

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:05.000
migrants out of Morocco, they're trying
to keep them from getting to Europe.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:11.630
They do in many respects, a lot of Spain's and
Europe's dirty work, with respect to

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:15.980
blocking people whose interest is to
cross.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:19.820
Another thing you'll notice is

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:23.610
that everyone in these camps is from
sub-Saharan Africa, basically countries

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.420
below this line.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:29.010
All migrants face extreme difficulties in their journey to

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:32.790
Europe, but migrants from places like
Syria have a much easier time just

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.440
walking up to the border and asking for
asylum the proper way.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:42.870
It's not an exaggeration to say that hardly any
sub-Saharan African is able to do that.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:48.660
They do have to resort to very
dangerous methods, like scaling the

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.860
fences or hiding in vehicles or taking
to the sea.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.660
Spain did build a new

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:03.700
office to handle the influx of migrants,
but not migrants from sub-Saharan Africa.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.940
You might say well that's reasonable right? Everybody

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:32.390
knows there's a war in Syria, so of
course it makes sense to presume that

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:37.100
Syrians are fleeing the war and
they're refugees, they need protection.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:42.410
But the flip side of that, the
presumption that people from countries

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:47.390
where there isn't like a live war, that
you are reading about in the newspapers,

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:51.320
the presumption that people from those
countries are not in need of

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.120
international protection, is a very
dangerous presumption.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:03.020
The world is experiencing a record number of refugees
and displaced people. While some

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:07.459
countries have opened their doors to let
these people in, many are responding by

00:10:07.459 --> 00:10:12.050
building walls, but this won't stop them
from coming. No matter how dangerous the

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.360
journey, the people in these camps will
keep trying.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:31.779
That's the six episode of Borders, I hope
you've enjoyed this series. Today we also

00:10:31.779 --> 00:10:36.190
launched the on-site experience for all
six of the Borders stories, with graphs

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:40.300
and charts and visualizations to kind of
go a little bit further into some of

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:44.589
these stories. I'm gonna leave a link
here where you can go see that and thank

00:10:44.589 --> 00:10:46.500
you for being a part of this journey.
