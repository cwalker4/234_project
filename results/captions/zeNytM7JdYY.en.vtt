00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
History is full of decisions that if I
had gone a different way could have

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.030
given us quite a different outcome today
and space history certainly has its fair

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:19.529
share of those. As part of NASA's quest
for a replacement Space Shuttle it

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.100
embarked on a project that looked as if
it could bring a groundbreaking

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.390
combination of technologies that would
make the original Space Shuttle look

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.759
like a 1970s trim phone compared to an
iPhone X. But in a decision that was as

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.399
dogmatic as it was controversial the
project was cancelled when 95% of the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.950
components had been fabricated, tested,
delivered and even a new launch facility

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.430
had been built. The project was the x-33
and was revolutionary on many fronts, it

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.559
was designed to be fully reusable like a
plane, it would be much cleaner than the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.059
shuttle as it would only use hydrogen
and oxygen for both for the main engines as

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.339
well as the thrusters and wouldn't use
any solid rocket boosters. It could be

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.930
remotely controlled and take off
vertically and land on a normal runway

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.909
much like the space shuttle but unlike
the shuttle it was designed to be easy

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.430
to maintain and dramatically cut the
amount of time, resources and people

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.920
required to launch and then turn it
around for the next flight and thus cut

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.520
the cost of getting each kilogram of
payload into space from $20,000 to

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.590
$2,000. The roots of this design would
come from a previous x-plane project

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.939
called the national space plane or the X-30 which itself can be traced back to

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.930
the X-20 dinosaur in the early 1960s.
When Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.040
his administration was looking at the
Soviet nuclear threat and what they

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.310
could do to counter it. In 1983 Reagan
announced the Star Wars initiative but

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.950
what soon became clear was in order to
build a space shield hundreds of new

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.209
satellites would need to be placed into
orbit. The problem was fast becoming

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.290
clear to the US Air Force was of the
maintenance schedule of the Shuttle

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.879
would not be able to keep up with the
amount of hardware that will be needed

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.019
to be placed in orbit so they were
looking at additional ways to deploy

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:28.260
their hardware. From 1982 to 1985 a
secret DARPA project called 'Copper Canyon'

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.049
was set up to look into the
viability of a single-stage-to-orbit

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.879
reusable space plane that would use an
air-breathing engine, be able to take off

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:44.760
fly to space, deliver its payload and
then land back on a normal runway much

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.189
more like an airplane than a rocket based
to shuttle. In 1990 this eventually

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:55.829
became the x30 project however this was
cancelled just three years later in 1993

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:01.079
before a single prototype was ever built
because the technology required to make

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.720
it work was found to be many more years
away than expected. NASA however

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.489
continued its research into a
replacement for the shuttle and in 1994

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.540
it requested proposals from the
aerospace industry to come up with

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.310
designs for a single-stage-to-orbit
vehicle. There would also be a change as

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.870
to how NASA would operate the new system. Instead of owning and operating the new

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.340
spacecraft like a shuttle, NASA would
purchase flights from the company that

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.349
developed the winning system, this meant
that the commercial companies they

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.690
would be renting the craft rather than
just selling it to NASA. Three companies

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.569
replied McDonnell Douglas, Rockwell
aerospace and Lockheed Martin. Of the three

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.500
designs for Rockwell one was pretty
conservative and was basically an

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.799
updated remake of the Space Shuttle. The
McDonnell Douglas design the DC-X looked

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.389
like has come from the set of Buck
Rogers with a vertical takeoff, a lifting

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:05.220
body design and vertical landing with
four legs that dropped from the corner

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.569
of the vehicles base. It was a
strange-looking beast but it worked and

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:15.120
it had been flight tested it would also
go on to serve as the inspiration for

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.979
the Blue Origin New Shepard and several
of the key engineers that worked on the

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:26.150
DC X would go on to work for Blue Origin.
The most ambitious design was that from

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.009
Lockheed Martin, this pushed the envelope not
only in its design but also its chosen

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.720
propulsion and also construction.
Lockheed Martin won the contract which

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.979
was worth about $1 billion to
produce a 53% scale flight demonstrator

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.699
something but commentators of the time
said was an incredibly low price to

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.410
bring together an all-new vehicle,
however if it was successful it would

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.210
then be made into a full-scale
commercial version called the 'VentureStar'

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.370
The Lockheed design would use
aerospike engines first developed by

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:07.669
Rocketdyne in the 1970s but as yet still
not flight tested. It would not use any

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.530
boosters or external fuel tanks like the
shuttle so it would have to be very

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.750
light with the empty weight being no
more than 10% of the fully laden weight.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.800
This would mean on landing it would be
able to use a runway as short as 8000ft

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.330
much shorter than required
for the shuttle and increasing the

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.010
possible number of landing sites.
It would also have a lifting body, that

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.419
means that the body of the spacecraft
can generate his own lift without the

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.220
need for wings like the Space Shuttle.
Because of the greater surface area of

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.570
the body it would re-enter the
atmosphere more gently and generate less

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.789
heat allowing for the use of an all-new
thermal protection system made up of

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:56.110
metallic tiles. These were developed by
BF Goodrich and made from Inconel, a

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.830
heat-resistant nickel-chromium based of
superalloy which was first developed

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:06.440
for the SR-71 blackbird. These will be
screwed to the body structure using

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:13.250
mounting brackets, this change alone
would save an estimated 17,000 men hours

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.349
of checking and replacing the ceramic
tiles on each flight of a space shuttle.

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:23.300
But the most controversial element of
the design was that of the main fuel

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.520
tanks which would also be the structure
of the body, it was almost like a giant

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:34.250
flying fuel tank and this would be its
Achilles heel. The fuel tanks one for

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.719
the liquid oxygen in the front and the
two liquid hydrogen ones on either side

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:42.379
at the rear
would be made from a carbon composite

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:46.509
material which was meant to be lighter
and stronger than the aluminium tanks and

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:52.279
this is where things started to unravel.
The choice of composite instead of metal

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:56.569
was meant to be cheaper to make but
engineers and designers knew that it was

00:06:56.569 --> 00:07:00.829
going to be a big problem. They were
trying to make a new fuel tank to hold

00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:06.379
pressurized liquid hydrogen with hollow 
honeycomb walls. There was in fact so

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:09.919
much resistance from the engineers that
they forced the management to allow them

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:14.779
to build Aluminium Lithium tanks in the
same way as they did for the space

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:19.249
shuttle. When it came to the testing of
the first composite tank, it failed the

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:24.379
pressure test as the material De bonded.
air was getting into the honeycomb walls

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:30.139
and was liquefying, forcing the composite
to break apart. Engineers had anticipated

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:36.049
this and had a solution to fill the
honeycomb with closed cell foam but this

00:07:36.049 --> 00:07:41.119
would add an additional 500kg of
weight to the rear of a craft. Then

00:07:41.119 --> 00:07:45.739
another problem showed up the aerospike engines needed to have larger than

00:07:45.739 --> 00:07:50.209
expected exhaust ramps to allow them to
cool correctly. These ramps were made

00:07:50.209 --> 00:07:56.149
from a heat-resistant heavy copper alloy
called Narloy-Z, so now the engines would

00:07:56.149 --> 00:08:01.519
also be adding extra weight to the rear
of a craft. This extra weight at the rear

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:07.279
would make the lifting body unstable
without a major redesign something that

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:12.769
would cost a lot in both time and money.
The problems with the composite fuel

00:08:12.769 --> 00:08:16.609
tanks were in danger of stopping the
whole project so the engineer's asked to

00:08:16.609 --> 00:08:21.919
fit a standby aluminium fuel tanks. These
had passed the pressure testing and

00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:26.119
ironically turned out to be slightly
lighter than the composite ones so

00:08:26.119 --> 00:08:30.939
things were looking OK as this would
also help offset the engine weight issue.

00:08:30.939 --> 00:08:36.439
NASA had chosen for Lockheed designed
because it was A) a very low bid and B) it

00:08:36.439 --> 00:08:41.509
was to introduce a range of new and
untested technologies in one project.

00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:46.459
This was a high risk approach but if it
worked it would be a game-changer for

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:50.250
launch vehicles. However there was one more problem that

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:56.610
would prove to be the killer blow to the
entire project. In 2001 the NASA director

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.000
at the time Ivan Bekey was to appear in front of a

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.040
Subcommittee on space and Aeronautics at the US House of Representatives for a

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.900
funding round. In a speech that stunned
the workers on the project, he said that

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:17.160
the X-33 project must use the composite
fuel tanks as this was key to testing

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.000
the interaction of all the new
technologies in real-world flight tests.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.760
To use the aluminium tanks instead of
the composite ones which would be the

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.570
structure of a craft and where the new
thermal protection system will be

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:36.570
mounted to would make the whole point of real-world testing invalid he said. With

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:41.190
this the X-33 was effectively doomed
without extra funding for the

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:46.070
development of the composite fuel tanks
something both  NASA and Lockheed Martin

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:52.170
disagreed about who should pay.Now some might say why not take a more pragmatic

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:56.850
approach and build with aluminium tanks
to test it and then change over to the

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:01.170
composite when the technology had
advanced enough, the reply to this was

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:06.330
that because the VentureStar was to be
privately funded, if it were to go ahead

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:11.520
with the aluminium tanks it would be
confirming that the technology was

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:17.580
simply too difficult to do and maybe the
whole project was overreaching itself on

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:23.550
the technology front and that would make
funding almost impossible to find. With

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:27.480
this impasse on the side of the
management the project was canceled in

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:34.170
2001 and all the new technologies and
hopes of a brave new future for reusable

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:39.450
vehicles went with it.
In 2004 Northrop Grumman who have been

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.560
working with NASA announced that they
had solved the problem of the composite

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:48.300
fuel tanks after they had used a new
manufacturing technique and they had

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:53.790
successfully been tested over 40 times
over a nine-month period and they made

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:59.160
them 25% lighter than the aluminium ones.
There were several attempts by the US

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.590
Air Force take on the project and make the VentureStar

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:07.290
their own, they had plans to
have it fully usable by 2012 but each

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:11.610
time they tried it was denied at the
highest levels of government leading

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.960
some to say that it was a political
decision and that Dick Cheney was not

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:21.720
going to let a project set up by Al Gore
back on the books. No part of the X-33

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:26.820
technology would be used for the new
upcoming SLS system which was to use

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:32.160
traditional disposable rockets in much
the same way as Apollo had done 50 years

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.590
earlier. NASA has acknowledged that it
made fundamental mistakes and was simply

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:42.480
trying to do too much with too little
funding on a high-risk project, which

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.600
with a little greater forthought and
funding could have given us a

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:53.130
revolutionary new space shuttle and
probably changed the way we access space.

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:57.360
If you're interested in finding out more
about the aerospike engines, we have

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.230
a video about those and I'd also like to
thank our patrons for their ongoing

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:06.420
support and please check out some of our
other videos. So for now I'd like to say

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:12.320
thanks watching and please subscribe,
