00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:02.035
The President: Thank you
very much, everybody.

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:05.004
It's a great honor to have
the Crown Prince with us.

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:09.576
Saudi Arabia has been a
very great friend

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:13.279
and a big purchaser of equipment
and lots of other things.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.015
And one of the biggest 
investments in the United States

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:18.818
is their -- I guess
it's your big investment --

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:21.688
is buying stock in
companies and various

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:25.325
other things in the United
States and creating jobs.

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:28.128
We've become very good
friends over a fairly

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:29.262
short period of time.

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:32.031
I was in Saudi
Arabia in May.

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:35.301
And we are bringing back
hundreds of billions of dollars

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:36.636
into the
United States.

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:39.239
And we understand that,
and they understand that.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.242
Some of the things that --
have been approved

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:45.111
and are currently under
construction and will be

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:48.548
delivered to Saudi Arabia
very soon,

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:49.916
and that's for their protection.

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:55.054
But if you look, in terms
of dollars, $3 billion,

00:00:55.054 --> 00:01:02.595
$533 million, $525 million
-- that's peanuts for you.

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:03.730
(Laughter.)

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.898
You should
have increased it.

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:11.471
$880 million, $645
million, $6 billion --

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:17.477
that's for frigates; $889
million, $63 million --

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:20.647
and that's for
various artillery.

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:24.851
Some of the things that
we're now working on

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:30.723
and that have been ordered and
will shortly be started

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:32.025
in construction and
delivered:

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:37.030
the THAAD system -- $13 billion;
the C-130 airplanes,

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:46.139
the Hercules, great plane --
$3.8 billion;

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:49.108
the Bradley Vehicles -- 
that's the tanks --

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:57.851
$1.2 billion; and 
the P-8 Poseidons -- $1.4 billion.

00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:00.320
And what it does is it
really means many, many jobs.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.492
We're talking about over 
40,000 jobs in the United States.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:08.228
So, we make the best
equipment in the world.

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:09.729
There's nobody even close.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.833
And Saudi Arabia is buying
a lot of this equipment,

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:16.936
and a lot of people are at
work making the equipment,

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:19.506
not only for us -- because
we, as you know,

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:23.910
we're getting a $700 billion
military proposal.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.112
And that's even a
lot for you guys.

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:29.282
But we're getting a $700
billion military plan this year,

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:35.121
and 716 will be next
year -- $716 billion.

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:38.324
So, we really have a
great friendship,

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:39.692
a great relationship.

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:41.728
I would really have to say
the relationship was,

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:44.330
to put it mildly, very, very
strained

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.699
during the Obama administration.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.836
And the relationship, now,
is probably as good

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:53.673
as it's really ever been, and
I think will probably

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.108
only get better.

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:59.078
Tremendous investments
made in our country.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:03.416
And that means jobs for our 
workers, jobs for our people.

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:04.384
Also, defense.

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:07.053
We're talking about
defense, and we're working

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:09.088
very hard with
Saudi Arabia.

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:13.927
And they're also footing a big 
part of the bill for defense --

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:14.861
the whole Middle East.

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.063
And we know what's
happened in the Middle East.

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:18.898
And it has not been a
pretty picture

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:21.534
for the United States
or for anybody.

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:23.336
And a lot of things are changing,

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:24.837
and they're changing very rapidly.

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:28.174
As you know, ISIS is now 
-- we've recaptured almost

00:03:28.174 --> 00:03:30.910
100 percent of the
territory, as you probably

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.680
have heard before anybody.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.084
But we've captured close
to 100 percent of the territory

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:40.053
held by ISIS.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.855
We've moved very
rapidly, very quickly.

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:44.891
And that's, really, coming
to an end

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.660
in that part of the world 
-- it's coming to an end.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.163
And we'll be able to get
out of certain areas

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:53.266
that we've wanted to get out of
for a long period of time.

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:55.969
And other countries
can handle it.

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:58.137
At this point, they'll
be able to handle it.

00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:00.139
So, it's a great honor
to have you

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.241
and your representatives here.

00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:03.676
Crown Prince, thank
you very much.

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:05.211
Thank you for being here.

00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:06.346
Crown Prince bin Salman:
Thank you, Mr. President.

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:08.214
Actually, the relations
between Saudi Arabia

00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:10.016
and United States of America,
it's old relation.

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:11.684
We are the oldest ally
for the United States of America

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:12.385
in the
Middle East.

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:13.519
The President: Right.

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.188
Crown Prince bin Salman:
More than 80 years of alliance

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:16.489
and big
interest -- politically,

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.959
economically, and
security, in different area --

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.160
a lot of area.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.996
And the foundation for relation, 
it's really huge

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:24.230
and really deep.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.065
And a different issue --
we know that today,

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:29.369
the relation, it's the cause
of more than 4 million jobs

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:30.637
in the United of
States of America,

00:04:30.637 --> 00:04:31.938
directly and non-directly.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.873
Also, it's a cause for
a lot of jobs in Saudi Arabia

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:36.309
directly
and non-directly.

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:38.845
And, as you know, Mr.
President, from day one

00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:45.184
you've reached this office, 
we've planned to tackle

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:47.153
200 billion U.S. dollars 
for opportunities

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:47.954
in the next four years,

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.356
but it ends up with
400 billion U.S. dollar

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:51.357
for opportunities.

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:52.692
We've talked to you,
Mr. President,

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:54.060
about the military deals, the
implementation,

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.895
and it is more than 50 percent.

00:04:55.895 --> 00:04:57.363
And, also, the
implementation overall

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:59.632
in the 400 billion 
U.S. dollar of opportunity,

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:01.467
more than 55 percent.

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:02.669
The President: Right.

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:03.770
Crown Prince bin Salman:
We planned this for

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.071
next 10 years, but it happens
in one year,

00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:06.639
we implement 55 percent, though.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.108
So, this is signal that
there is a lot of things

00:05:09.108 --> 00:05:12.078
could be tackled in the
close future,

00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:13.346
and more opportunities.

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:15.782
And that why we are here
today, to be sure

00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:18.985
that we've tackled all the
opportunities and achieve it,

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:21.454
and also get rid of
all the threats

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:23.623
facing our both countries and
the whole world.

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:24.957
So, I am very glad
to be here today.

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:26.325
The President:
Well that's right.

00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:28.361
And you know, one thing that 
you have been really focused

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:30.396
on is the
terrorism threat

00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:32.031
and the funding of terrorism.

00:05:32.031 --> 00:05:36.169
And whether it's Saudi Arabia 
or other countries, as we know,

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.704
there
will be no funding.

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:40.506
It is -- we have a zero
tolerance for the funding

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:43.443
of terrorists, and we're
working very hard.

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:45.478
And I will say that Saudi
Arabia has been working

00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:49.115
very hard on that, as are
certain other countries

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:50.650
in the Middle East.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.885
When I was there in May,
I think it was one of

00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:55.521
the most incredible two-day
meetings that I've ever seen --

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:56.956
that anybody
has ever seen.

00:05:56.956 --> 00:05:59.258
It was an amazing
two-day period.

00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:01.594
We had 56 countries.

00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:04.897
We had -- everybody was there 
at the head of every country.

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:07.066
Virtually -- I guess, in
every case,

00:06:07.066 --> 00:06:08.968
it was the head of the country.

00:06:08.968 --> 00:06:11.971
And we talked about terrorism 
and the funding of terrorism.

00:06:11.971 --> 00:06:13.806
And it will
not be allowed.

00:06:13.806 --> 00:06:15.408
It will not be allowed.

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:17.110
That would be the one
thing that would end

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.512
the relationship
with any country.

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:22.749
So, I think there's a very
big focus on that --

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:26.052
the funding of terrorism
-- meaning, it's over.

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:30.056
And the other thing that I
really am very happy about

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:33.459
is that we talked about
400 billion dollars' worth

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:36.262
of investment, of which
we've already invested

00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:39.332
and seen invested $200 billion
to our companies,

00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:43.636
to various other places, and
people that make things.

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:46.973
So, a lot of places
throughout the United States

00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:48.941
are benefitting by
this massive investment

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:52.812
made by Saudi Arabia to buy 
product from the United States.

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:55.448
And again, we make the
best military product in

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:58.684
the world, whether it's missiles 
or planes or anything else.

00:06:58.684 --> 00:07:00.153
There's nobody that
even comes close.

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:02.255
So, I just want to
thank you and I want

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:03.756
to congratulate you
on everything.

00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:04.924
Thank you very much.

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:05.792
Crown Prince bin Salman:
Thank you, Mr. President.

00:07:07.426 --> 00:07:10.196
The President: Thank you
very much, everybody.

00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:13.866
The Press: Can you comment
on the bombings in Austin,

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:15.334
Mr. President?

00:07:15.334 --> 00:07:17.603
The President: The
bombings in Austin are terrible.

00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:21.240
The local, state, and
federal are working hand-in-hand

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.242
to get
to the bottom of it.

00:07:23.242 --> 00:07:26.612
This is obviously a very,
very sick individual,

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:29.182
or maybe individuals.

00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:32.819
These are sick people, and 
we will get to the bottom of it.

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:34.921
We will be very strong.

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:37.423
We have all sorts of
federal agencies

00:07:37.423 --> 00:07:38.191
over there right now.

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:39.592
We're searching.

00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:42.295
What's going on in
Austin -- a great place,

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:46.899
tremendous place -- is
absolutely disgraceful.

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:50.002
So we have a lot of
power over there.

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:52.805
We're looking; it's
not easy to find.

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:55.308
But these are sick people
and we have to find them

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:56.709
as soon as possible.

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:58.578
We have to find them,
really, immediately.

00:07:58.578 --> 00:08:01.280
I will say, working with Texas, 
working with

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.217
the local governments 
has been great.

00:08:04.217 --> 00:08:06.319
But we have to produce,
we have to find this

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.354
very sick person or people.

00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:09.255
Thank you all very much.

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:14.327
The Press: How was your
call with President Putin?

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:19.165
The President: I had a
call with President Putin

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:21.500
and congratulated him
on the victory --

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.769
his electoral victory.

00:08:23.769 --> 00:08:29.609
The call had to do, also,
with the fact that we will

00:08:29.609 --> 00:08:32.778
probably get together in
the not-too-distant future

00:08:32.778 --> 00:08:37.650
so that we can discuss arms, 
we can discuss the arms race.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.052
As you know, he made a
statement that being

00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:42.054
in an arms race is not
a great thing.

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:43.389
That was right after the
election --

00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:45.324
one of the first statements 
he made.

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:49.629
And we are spending $700 billion 
this year on our military,

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:51.764
and a lot of it
is that we are going

00:08:51.764 --> 00:08:54.033
to remain stronger than any
other nation

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:55.701
in the world by far.

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:57.937
We had a very good call,
and I suspect that we'll

00:08:57.937 --> 00:09:00.406
probably be meeting in the
not-too-distant future

00:09:00.406 --> 00:09:05.912
to discuss the arms race,
which is getting out of control,

00:09:05.912 --> 00:09:08.981
but we will never
allow anybody to have

00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:12.218
anything even close
to what we have.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:16.088
And also, to discuss
Ukraine and Syria

00:09:16.088 --> 00:09:18.157
and North Korea and
various other things.

00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:22.261
So, I think, probably,
we'll be seeing President Putin

00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:24.563
in the
not-too-distant future.

00:09:24.563 --> 00:09:26.032
The Press: How are you
going to counter Iran?

00:09:26.032 --> 00:09:27.500
This is a Saudi --

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.935
The President: Well, we're 
going to see what happens.

00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:30.603
The Iran deal
is coming up.

00:09:30.603 --> 00:09:33.472
It's probably another
month or so,

00:09:33.472 --> 00:09:35.041
and you're going to see what I do.

00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:38.678
But Iran has not been
treating that part of the world,

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:41.147
or the world
itself, appropriately.

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:44.383
A lot of bad things
are happening in Iran.

00:09:44.383 --> 00:09:47.219
The deal is coming up in
one month,

00:09:47.219 --> 00:09:48.821
and you will see what happens.

00:09:48.821 --> 00:09:50.156
Okay?

00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:51.290
The Press: Your Royal Highness, 
should the President pull out

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.825
of the Iran deal?

00:09:52.825 --> 00:09:55.394
Crown Prince bin Salman:
Well, we'll talk about that today.

00:09:55.394 --> 00:09:56.762
The President:
(Laughs.) Okay?

00:09:56.762 --> 00:09:57.596
Thank you very
much, everybody.
