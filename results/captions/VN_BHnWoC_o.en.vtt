[music playing]

00:00:04.603 --> 00:00:05.572
Hi.

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:06.705
I'm Pink, and I'm
about to do the hottest

00:00:06.805 --> 00:00:07.407
thing I've done all day--

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.440
[bell rings]

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.008
--and answer Ellen's
Burning Questions.

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:09.575
[bell ringing]

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:12.611
[music playing]

00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:13.446
[bell ringing]

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:14.847
The habit you will never break.

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:17.016
Telling everyone how I
really feel about them.

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:18.084
[bell ringing]

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:18.617
Have you ever worn a
disguise in public?

00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:19.886
Yes.

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:21.187
I once spent two hours
putting on a wig in New York.

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:23.289
And then I walked outside,
and the very first man I saw

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:24.724
said, "Nice wig, Pink."

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:26.025
I went back upstairs and took--

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:27.093
[bleep]

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:27.960
-- off, and I was
terribly embarrassed.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.261
[bell ringing]

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:30.730
What Olympic sport do you
think you would be best at?

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.132
Hot dog eating, as long
as they were veggie dogs.

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:34.367
[bell ringing]

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:35.902
If you weren't a performer,
what would you be doing?

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:38.204
I would either be
living or working

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:39.204
at a mental institution.

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:39.772
[laughter]

00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:40.906
[bell ringing]

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:42.475
If you had a perfume,
what would it be called?

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:45.711
Musk or The Everything Bagel.

00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:46.779
[bell ringing]

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.414
Your superhero power
of choice would be.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:50.983
To read people's minds,
because they're wussies,

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.985
and they never say what
they're really thinking.

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:54.019
[bell ringing]

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:55.488
The funniest fail
you've had on stage.

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:58.791
I once fell off a
stage into-- there

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:00.893
was a moat around the stage.

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:03.663
And a man had light-up
nipples, and I saw it,

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:05.064
and I got excited.

00:01:05.164 --> 00:01:06.766
And I walked towards him, and
I went straight into the water.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:07.467
[bell ringing]

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:09.769
Your guilty binge food.

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:10.737
Oh, God.

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:12.104
Everything.

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:20.513
Crumb donuts or anything with
cheese or carbs, like pasta.

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:21.247
I'm hungry.

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:22.281
[bell ringing]

00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:23.849
Now, Ellen, I have
a question for you.

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:26.919
What's your least favorite
question to be asked?

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:28.921
And then I'll have a
question for you next time.

00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:29.955
[bell ringing]

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:30.490
Bye.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.357
I love you.

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:35.028
