00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.916
Undisclosed millions

00:00:01.916 --> 00:00:04.290
flooded into the Clinton
Foundation

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.950
From people tied to a controversial uranium
deal.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.280
That gave a Russian backed company

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.610
Control of one-fifth of the US uranium production

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.330
This is the story of Uranium One.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.220
Welcome to America Uncovered,

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.730
I’m Chris Chappell.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:20.730
Russia collusion.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.999
In US politics, it’s the new black.

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:24.550
Everyone’s wearing it.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.550
Needless to say you’ve heard about

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.711
Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation

00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:30.199
into whether Trump colluded with Russia.

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.190
But the President has also accused his political
opponents

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.030
of some shady deals with Russia.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.260
What was Trump talking about?

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.450
A scandal involving a company known as Uranium
One.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.180
It’s now owned by a Russian backed company
called Rosatom.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.450
That purchase gave Russia control

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.610
of 20% of all the United States uranium production,

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.850
a national security concern.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.230
But the deal sailed through despite security
concerns,

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.090
at a time when Hillary Clinton was Secretary
of State.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.710
And also at that time, millions of dollars

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.480
flowed into the Clinton Foundation from people
tied to the deal.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.330
There’s been some new developments in the
story.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.330
 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.330
At the end of November,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.880
the FBI raided the home an FBI contractor
Dennis Cain.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.299
According to his lawyer,

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.740
16 FBI agents showed up at his house

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.799
and conducted a 6 hour raid.

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.200
Cain, according to his lawyer,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.149
is a recognized whistleblower

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.189
protected under the Intelligence Community
Whistleblower Protection Act.

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.299
Now, according to the Daily Caller News Foundation,

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.219
Cain handed over documents that show

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:36.240
“Federal officials failed to investigate
potential criminal activity

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.039
regarding former Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton,

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:40.420
the Clinton Foundation

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.310
and Rosatom, the Russian company that purchased
Uranium One.”

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.990
Not only that, but then FBI Director Robert
Mueller

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.259
failed to investigate the allegations of criminal
misconduct

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.150
involving Uranium One.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.509
Now, those claims are based on a document

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.659
that only the Daily Caller has seen,

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.520
so I haven’t been able to independently
verify it.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.289
But Senator Charles Grassley

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.719
has asked the Inspector General to make the
Cain documents public.

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.259
So this has been the spark

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.129
that re-ignited interest in the story of Uranium
One.

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.450
Get it, spark and re-ignited?

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.440
What’s that, Shelley?

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.760
OK, fine,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.200
Uranium involves nuclear fission,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.260
not sparks or fire.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.459
Anyway,

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.170
what is the real story on Uranium One?

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.069
Well, as the New York Times says,

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.900
the story of Uranium One,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.489
“underscores the special ethical challenges

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.030
presented by the Clinton Foundation,

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.490
headed by a former president who relied heavily

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.439
on foreign cash to accumulate $250 million

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:46.000
in assets even as his wife helped steer American
foreign policy

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.629
as secretary of state,

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.390
presiding over decisions with the potential

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.659
to benefit the foundation’s donors.”

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.110
Back in 2005,

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.040
Bill Clinton travelled to Kazakhstan on the
personal jet

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.819
of Canadian mining financier Frank Giustra.

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.010
He ran a small company called UrAsia Energy
Ltd.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.420
Now Kazakhstan, is known for only a few things.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.129
Most importantly it’s the homeland of Borat.

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.129
But also,

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.250
it has a huge amount of uranium deposits.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.230
The uranium used in nuclear power plants.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.500
And also bombs.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.500
And also,

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.959
Kazakhstan has been run by the same

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.230
“president” for the past 28 years.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.310
Which is always a sign that

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.630
the “president” is probably closer to
a brutal dictator.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.670
Despite that,

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.640
Bill Clinton “handed the Kazakh president

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.379
a propaganda coup when he expressed support

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.540
for [his] bid to head an international elections
monitoring group,

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.090
undercutting American foreign policy

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.129
and criticism of Kazakhstan’s poor human
rights record by,

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.439
among others, his wife, then a senator.”

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.830
Wow, they have a very interesting relationship.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.159
“Bill, I am sick and tired

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:57.590
of you leaving your socks in the living room,

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.749
and constantly undermining my foreign policy
objectives.”

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:02.760
Just a few days after Bill Clinton and

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.739
the Canadian mining guy Frank Giustra visited
Kazakhstan,

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.239
Giustra’s company,

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:09.900
UrAsia Energy, signed a deal

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.760
to buy a large stake in three uranium mines

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.430
run by the Kazakh state-run uranium agency
Kazatomprom.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.759
And a few months later,

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.880
it just so happened Giustra decided to donate

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.270
31.3 million dollars to the Clinton Foundation.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.900
“The value of UrAsia shares

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.660
increased seventyfold between 2005 and 2007.”

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.449
In February 2007,

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.710
the head of the Kazakh uranium company Kazatomprom

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.660
payed a personal visit to Bill Clinton’s
home in New York.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.949
The meeting was set up by Giustra.

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:47.979
Now, when the New York Times

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.070
asked Clinton and Giustra about the meeting,

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.230
they both denied it happened.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.419
Until The Times pressed.

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.500
Then it turned out they remembered the meeting

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.120
about the future of the nuclear energy industry.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.430
But who could forget a few months later when

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.680
Giustra donated $100 million dollars to Clinton
Foundation.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.930
Funny how those donations

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.590
time up with the Kazakh uranium industry.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.370
Anywho, 2007 is also when UrAsia

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.819
merged with a South African company Uranium
One,

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.020
to become a new company called,

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.020
Uranium One.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.310
Yeah, I guess that is the better name.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.210
Giustra sold his stake in Uranium One,

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.009
and was replaced by the new chairman,

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.340
a Canadian stockholder named Ian Telfer.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.500
What is it with these Canadians?

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.330
Anyway, as with any good Canadian,

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.330
Uranium One began trying to

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.010
get a piece of the much more delicious American
pie.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.289
Under Telfer, Uranium One set out to become

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:48.479
“a powerhouse in the United States uranium
sector

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.590
with the potential to become the domestic
supplier

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.759
of choice for U.S. utilities.”

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:56.379
Uranium One began buying up US assets.

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:58.850
Mills in Utah, uranium exploration properties

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.720
in four Western states,

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.509
the Energy Metals Corporation

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:04.710
and its uranium holdings in Wyoming,

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.370
Texas and Utah.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.449
Now that’s important.

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:11.270
That meant Uranium One controlled 20%

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.400
of the United States uranium production.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.699
“The United States gets one-fifth

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:18.540
of its electrical power from nuclear plants,

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.830
it produces only around 20 percent

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.479
of the uranium it needs,

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:26.800
and most plants have only 18 to 36 months
of reserve.”

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.790
But Uranium One was a Canadian company,

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.810
so how much harm could it do, right?

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.069
I mean, if there ever were a problem,

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:35.730
they’d apologize to us.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.230
But remember how Uranium One

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.139
had merged with UrAsia,

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:41.000
which had used Bill Clinton’s influence

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.599
to buy stakes in those Uranium mines in Kazakhstan?

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:46.539
And how those mines are run by the

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:49.009
Kazak state-owned company Kazatomprom?

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:51.690
Well, you know who else was trying

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.200
to get a hold of a lot of uranium?

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.200
Russia.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.690
In 2006, Russia approved

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.139
a $10 billion dollar plan to its grow uranium
production

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:02.590
by 600 percent.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.539
And a key player in that plan was

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:09.659
the Russian state-owned atomic energy corporation
Rosatom.

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:14.740
Boy, if only Rosatom could buy a company like
Uranium One.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.389
Not only would that give Russia a stake in
20%

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:19.370
of the United States’ uranium production,

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.370
it would also get them big shares in those

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.460
nice uranium mines in Kazakhstan.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.979
Well, turns out Uranium One

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:30.520
was about to run into some problems.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.629
In May 2009, the head of Kazatomprom

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:36.849
was arrested for illegally selling uranium
to foreign companies,

00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:40.110
including some owned by Uranium One.

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.580
And Uranium One stock prices fell by 40%.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.669
Wow, what a great opportunity for Russia’s
Rosatom!

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:50.830
They bought a 17% stake in Uranium One.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.500
How wonderfully timed and purely coincidental!

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.810
Unless it was part of a Russian power play

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.539
for control of Kazakh uranium assets.

00:07:59.539 --> 00:08:02.039
But why stop at 17%?

00:08:02.039 --> 00:08:04.319
In 2010, Rosatom upped it

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:08.439
to a 51% controlling stake in Uranium One.

00:08:08.439 --> 00:08:13.110
And by 2013, Rosatom had purchased full ownership.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.970
It was a great deal for Rosatom.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:18.349
It made them one of the world’s largest
uranium producers,

00:08:18.349 --> 00:08:20.689
and it brought Russia much closer to the goal

00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:24.289
of controlling much of the global uranium
supply chain.

00:08:24.289 --> 00:08:26.850
In fact, Rosatom’s chief executive

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:29.440
even told Putin in a staged interview,

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.010
“Few could have imagined in the past

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.070
that we would own 20 percent of U.S. reserves.”

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.399
Yeah, something about Russia, the US, and

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:40.849
nuclear energy doesn’t seem to mix.

00:08:40.849 --> 00:08:44.159
But even Jack Ryan is helpless to stop it.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.820
But wasn’t there some kind of resistance

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.610
to this Russian takeover of a company that
controlled

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.980
so much American uranium production?

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.360
Well, in fact, there was.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.070
There was lot of concern within the US government,

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.190
as well as with Uranium One shareholders.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.930
But, “The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
wrote...

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.190
that American uranium would be preserved for
domestic use,

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.310
regardless of who owned it.”

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.290
And the deal would need a careful review

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.650
by the Committee on Foreign Investment in
the United States,

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:14.650
or CFIUS.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.790
It’s made up of powerful members in the
US government,

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.540
including the attorney general,

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.230
the secretaries of the Treasury, Defense,

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:23.250
Homeland Security,

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.329
Commerce and Energy,

00:09:24.329 --> 00:09:25.940
and the Secretary of State

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.829
—who at the time of the deal,

00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:30.390
was Hillary Clinton.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.450
And they all said the deal was a.o.k.

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:34.519
Keep in mind, this was

00:09:34.519 --> 00:09:36.990
during President Obama’s strategic reset

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.790
of relations with Russia,

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:42.500
so he wanted to try and have a good relationship
with Putin.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.649
Ultimately, that did not work out.

00:09:44.649 --> 00:09:46.650
But, you might be concerned that with

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.240
Hillary Clinton’s position as Secretary
of State,

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.040
there would a risk that some of her decisions

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.580
might be influenced by donations to the Clinton
Foundation.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.940
Well, don’t worry.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.970
First, “Clinton has repeatedly denied

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.060
any involvement in the State Department’s

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.630
approval of the Uranium One sale.”

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.660
And when she became Secretary of State,

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.410
she had to sign a memorandum that said

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.950
the Clinton Foundation had to publicly disclose
all contributors.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.389
And yeah, it was a little strange

00:10:15.389 --> 00:10:19.040
that the public disclosure didn’t give exact
amounts,

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.779
it gave a ranges of contributions,

00:10:21.779 --> 00:10:26.389
but only one Uranium One official gave to
the Clinton Foundation.

00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:28.420
It was the chairman, Ian Telfer.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.889
And it was small, no more than 250,000,

00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:33.310
and that was in 2007,

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:37.100
before the Rosatom deal was even a twinkle
in Putin’s eye.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.100
So that’s that.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.180
There’s clearly no connection

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.779
between Hillary Clinton’s allowing

00:10:40.779 --> 00:10:42.550
the Uranium One deal to go through,

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.040
and donations to the Clinton Foundation.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.350
Except...

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:49.130
by reviewing Canadian tax records,

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.910
it turned out Telfer actually

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.500
donated millions of dollars to the Clinton
Foundation.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.870
But he did it through his family charity,

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:58.830
the Fernwood Foundation.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.180
In 2009, Uranium One asked for

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:05.130
US embassy to help keep its mines in Kazakhstan.

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.079
Fernwood Foundation donated a million dollars.

00:11:08.079 --> 00:11:10.410
In 2010, when the Russians were waiting

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:14.329
for CFIUS to approve it’s 51% state in Uranium
one,

00:11:14.329 --> 00:11:17.899
Fernwood foundation donated a quarter of a
million dollars.

00:11:17.899 --> 00:11:21.190
That was followed by 600,000 in 2011

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.860
and half a million in 2012.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.589
Now Uranium One Chairman Ian Telfer

00:11:26.589 --> 00:11:29.200
denies those donations were anything other
than

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.460
purely charitable donations.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:35.250
And Hillary Clinton also denies it affected
her decision making.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:38.900
And there is no proof that those donations
did.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.529
Just like there’s no proof that the half
million dollars

00:11:41.529 --> 00:11:44.570
Bill Clinton was paid to give a speech in
Moscow

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.240
by a government banked Russian investment
bank

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.361
had any influence over the Rosatom deal

00:11:49.361 --> 00:11:52.920
getting approved in that same month.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.920
Yeah, there’s no proof.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.730
It’s all just a little bit shady.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:57.730
And this is the problem when

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:01.530
government officials also have charitable
foundations.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.290
Why are these people really giving?

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.660
As a person with knowledge of the Clinton
Foundation’s

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.209
fund-raising operation told the New York Times,

00:12:09.209 --> 00:12:10.880
“Why do you think they are doing it

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.240
— because they love them?”

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.800
As the New York Times wrote in 2015,

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.660
“The ultimate authority to approve or reject

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.589
the Russian acquisition rested with the cabinet
officials

00:12:20.589 --> 00:12:22.269
on the foreign investment committee,

00:12:22.269 --> 00:12:24.580
including Mrs. Clinton—whose husband

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.680
was collecting millions in donations

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.150
from people associated with Uranium One.”

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.810
Now a lot of this information first came to
light

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.440
in the book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweizer.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.620
He’s the Breitbart News senior editor-at-large.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.190
So my first thought was,

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:42.220
maybe not the most trustworthy of sources.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.300
But, all these claims I mentioned

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:48.760
were also confirmed and built upon by the
New York Times.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.269
So if the Breitbart guy and the New York Times

00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:54.930
are coming up with the same story,

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:56.950
maybe it’s worth taking seriously.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.589
There’s more to this story,

00:12:58.589 --> 00:13:03.459
and we’ll get to that after this quick commercial
break.

00:13:03.459 --> 00:13:04.510
As early as 2009,

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.450
“the FBI had gathered substantial evidence

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.170
that Russian nuclear industry officials were
engaged

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:13.790
in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money
laundering

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.899
designed to grow Vladimir Putin’s atomic
energy business

00:13:16.899 --> 00:13:19.240
inside the United States.”

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.290
So it’s hard to imagine that no one involved
with CFIUS

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:25.399
knew about the FBI’s evidence on Russia.

00:13:25.399 --> 00:13:28.600
According to a legal expert interviewed by
Politifact,

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.290
The FBI “is well represented

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.850
as part of the Justice Department’s CFIUS
team...

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.300
It would be somewhat surprising to me

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.940
if a company was under scrutiny as a buyer
in CFIUS

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.779
and simultaneously under investigation for
criminal behavior

00:13:42.779 --> 00:13:46.339
by the FBI, but the criminal investigation

00:13:46.339 --> 00:13:50.860
was not known to the FBI’s representatives
on CFIUS.”

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.490
This investigation would have begun under

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.639
Robert Mueller, then director of the FBI.

00:13:55.639 --> 00:13:58.660
Now, we have no way to know if Hillary Clinton

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.470
knew about the FBI investigation.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:02.829
The investigation, by the way,

00:14:02.829 --> 00:14:07.990
was closed in 2015 by Mueller’s replacement,
James Comey.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.519
And Obama’s Attorney General Loretta Lynch

00:14:10.519 --> 00:14:14.660
put a gag order on one of the key FBI informants
involved.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:18.070
Of course, a possible high level scandal involving

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.580
Mueller, Comey, the Obama Administration

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.370
and the Clintons?

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:25.070
Trump was all over that,

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.769
and in 2017, he got his Attorney General

00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:30.540
Jeff Sessions to remove the gag order,

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:34.360
and the informant testified to three congressional
committees.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.440
This informant, William Campbell,

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.050
alleged Russia hired the American lobbying
firm

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:41.820
APCO Worldwide to give 3 million dollars

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.470
to the Clinton Foundation,

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.449
to help create a favorable environment for

00:14:45.449 --> 00:14:49.449
the Obama Administration to approve the Uranium
One deal.

00:14:49.449 --> 00:14:52.519
But Campbell was still unable to provide

00:14:52.519 --> 00:14:54.579
evidence of quid pro quo,

00:14:54.579 --> 00:14:56.949
where Hillary Clinton allegedly got the Uranium
One deal

00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:59.529
passed in exchange for money.

00:14:59.529 --> 00:15:01.259
And there is cause for some concern

00:15:01.259 --> 00:15:03.220
over Campbell’s credibility.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.411
The Justice Department under the Obama administration

00:15:05.411 --> 00:15:08.290
“began to have ‘serious credibility concerns’

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:11.560
based on ‘inconsistencies’ between his
testimony

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.540
and documents they obtained during the investigation.”

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.840
Campbell also may have had his memory affected

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.529
by medication he was taking for leukemia.

00:15:19.529 --> 00:15:23.300
So, is the real story of Russia collusion
one of

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.670
the Obama Administration and the Clintons?

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:28.440
Well, the only thing I can say for sure is,

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.410
I know President Trump hopes so.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.470
Will the recent FBI raid on whistleblower

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.779
Dennis Cain turn up anything new?

00:15:35.779 --> 00:15:37.600
The only thing that’s certain is

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.750
the Uranium One story has a long half life.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.329
So what do you think about the Uranium One
deal?

00:15:43.329 --> 00:15:45.720
Leave your comments below.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.829
When I was doing the research on this episode,

00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:50.589
I actually found a lot of cases where there
seemed to be

00:15:50.589 --> 00:15:53.649
other possible pay-for-play donations made

00:15:53.649 --> 00:15:55.670
to the Clinton Foundation.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:57.529
If you’d like to see an episode on that,

00:15:57.529 --> 00:15:59.190

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:11.029
in exchange for cash.

00:16:11.029 --> 00:16:12.660
