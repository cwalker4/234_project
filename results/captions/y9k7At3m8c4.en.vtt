00:00:01.301 --> 00:00:02.968
-President Trump's former
and current lawyers

00:00:02.968 --> 00:00:05.605
are causing problems for him
in the Russia investigation.

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:07.640
For more on this,
it's time for "A Closer Look."

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.743
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:13.479
Trump has spent
the last few weeks

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:15.715
openly threatening his former
lawyer, Michael Cohen,

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:17.717
by demanding that
law-enforcement officials

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:19.952
investigate Cohen's
father-in-law.

00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:21.821
Trump has been claiming
in interviews

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:24.190
that Cohen's father-in-law
did something illegal,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.425
although he doesn't seem
to know many details.

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:28.027
-In order to get
his sentence reduced,

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:29.528
he says, "I have an idea.

00:00:29.528 --> 00:00:32.865
I'll tell -- I'll give you some
information on the president."

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:34.333
Well, there is no information.

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:38.170
But he should give information,
maybe, on his father-in-law,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.174
because that's the one
that people want to look at.

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:42.575
Because where does that money --

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:44.177
That's the money in the family.

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:46.579
And I guess he didn't want
to talk about his father-in-law.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.347
He's trying to get
his sentence reduced.

00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:50.416
-What is his
father-in-law's name?

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:52.452
-I don't know.
But you'll find out.

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:54.187
-You don't know?

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:56.122
You just said
he committed a crime,

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:58.091
but you don't know his name?

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:00.459
Is he Zorro?

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:01.661
"We don't have a name,

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:05.465
but he did carve a 'Z'
into the White House.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:06.599
So...

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:08.268
[ Applause ]

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:13.139
We're, uh, keeping an eye out
for Zachs."

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:14.340
[ Laughter ]

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.642
Now, Cohen was supposed to
testify in public

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:18.711
to Congress next month
about his involvement

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:20.646
in plans to build a Trump Tower
in Moscow

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:21.815
during the 2016 campaign.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:23.549
But today he postponed
that testimony

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.051
due to Trump's threats.

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:26.585
Trump was asked about
Cohen's decision

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:28.120
at the White House
this afternoon.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.192
-He says he's been threatened
by you and Mr. Giuliani.

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:33.425
He and his family
have been threatened.

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:35.728
-No, I would say he's been
threatened by the truth.

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:37.797
He's only been threatened
by the truth.

00:01:37.797 --> 00:01:39.465
-Yeah, he's threatened
by the truth.

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:42.168
You know, truth like
his father-in-law's name!

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:43.702
[ Laughter ]

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:45.972
I don't know if he's threatened
by the truth,

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:47.506
but at least he knows the truth.

00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:49.676
If you were put under oath
in a courtroom

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:52.211
and a prosecutor asked you,
"What does the president do?"

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:53.245
you'd say...

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:55.047
-I don't know.
But you'll find out.

00:01:55.047 --> 00:01:56.949
[ Laughter ]
Yeah.

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:58.984
You might remember
that just a few days ago,

00:01:58.984 --> 00:02:01.220
a confusing saga unfolded
when BuzzFeed published

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.955
what seemed like
a blockbuster story

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:04.991
about that deal to build
the Trump Tower in Moscow.

00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:07.426
And then Special Counsel
Robert Mueller's office

00:02:07.426 --> 00:02:10.296
took the incredibly rare step
of issuing a public statement

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:11.831
claiming that the story
was inaccurate.

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:14.467
Well, BuzzFeed stood by
its initial report.

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.735
Trump slammed BuzzFeed
to the media broadly

00:02:16.735 --> 00:02:19.138
but claimed he was actually sad
about the fact

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:21.508
that BuzzFeed supposedly
got the story wrong.

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:27.714
-I think that the BuzzFeed piece
was a disgrace to our country.

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:30.282
It was a disgrace to journalism.

00:02:30.282 --> 00:02:32.552
And I think it's going to
take a long time

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:36.855
for the mainstream media
to recover its credibility.

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:38.858
It's lost
tremendous credibility.

00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:40.826
And believe me, that hurts me.

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:42.595
It hurts me to say it.

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:46.265
-No, you are not
in the least bit upset

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:47.733
about the media's credibility.

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:49.802
You wake up every day
and tweet "fake news,"

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:52.104
and your favorite hobby
is yelling at reporters.

00:02:52.104 --> 00:02:53.606
-You know what?
You've really had enough.

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:56.242
Hey, you've had enough.
Sit down. Sit down.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:58.778
Quiet, quiet,
quiet, quiet, quiet.

00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:00.746
Quiet.
Wait. Wait, wait.

00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:02.448
That's enough.
Put down the mic.

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:05.251
-He's like a wrestler
on steroids.

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:07.320
He's going to show up
to his next press conference

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.922
in a leotard and put Jim Acosta
in a choke hold.

00:03:09.922 --> 00:03:11.691
[ Laughter ]

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:13.259
Here's the thing about
the BuzzFeed story.

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:15.194
We're in this weird place
right now

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:17.563
where we keep waiting
for another smoking gun

00:03:17.563 --> 00:03:19.532
when what we already know
is incredibly damning.

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.233
The president was
secretly pursuing

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:22.535
a business deal in Russia

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:24.436
while his aides were
secretly meeting with Russians

00:03:24.436 --> 00:03:25.771
offering to help him win.

00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:28.507
His campaign chairman was
sharing internal polling data

00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:31.243
with a business associate
tied to Russian intelligence.

00:03:31.243 --> 00:03:33.413
And the entire time,
they were all lying about it.

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:35.815
What are we waiting for?
We have enough.

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:38.351
It's like we're all cops
in a surveillance van

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:40.452
watching a drug deal go down
saying,

00:03:40.452 --> 00:03:42.755
"Okay, they gave him the money.

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:45.725
And now they're giving them
the drugs.

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:49.462
And now they're all getting
in their cars and leaving.

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:52.598
And now we wait."

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:54.233
[ Laughter ]

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:56.469
The reason why --
[ Applause ]

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:02.375
The reason why it feels like
we're not getting traction

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:03.910
on the stuff we already know

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.945
is that our political system
is incapable of processing it

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:09.182
in the way a healthy
political system should.

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:11.584
Normally, if the president
lies repeatedly

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:14.219
about his entanglements
with a foreign adversary

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:17.323
or crimes committed by his
subordinates at his direction,

00:04:17.323 --> 00:04:19.492
that would prompt hearings,
investigations,

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:21.427
universal condemnation
by both sides.

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:23.729
Instead what we have
is one party that says,

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.699
"Hey, that's bad," and a another
party that says, "So what?

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.603
Every president in history has
paid hush money to a porn star."

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:33.705
[ Laughter ]

00:04:33.705 --> 00:04:36.976
And the BuzzFeed story
was actually a perfect dry run

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:41.280
for what will inevitably happen
if and when Mueller reveals

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.915
what really happened
between Trump and the Russians.

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:44.750
After the BuzzFeed story
was published

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.719
but before the special counsel
denied it,

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:48.421
Trump supporters
went on TV and radio

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:50.255
and offered up a series
of absurd reasons

00:04:50.255 --> 00:04:52.592
why it was not a big deal.

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:55.794
-President Trump
does not e-mail or text.

00:04:55.794 --> 00:04:58.130
He tweets, okay?
And he uses his phone.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.267
So there's gonna be no physical
evidence for any of this.

00:05:01.267 --> 00:05:03.135
-The first question has to be,

00:05:03.135 --> 00:05:07.806
since when has Democrats started
caring about obstruction?

00:05:07.806 --> 00:05:12.578
Because the biggest slam-dunk
case of obstruction of justice,

00:05:12.578 --> 00:05:16.815
if we have equal justice and
equal application of our laws,

00:05:16.815 --> 00:05:19.551
is Hillary Clinton's
subpoenaed e-mails.

00:05:19.551 --> 00:05:21.120
-This is an absurdity.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.990
I mean, can you imagine any
president of the United States

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.859
being dumb enough
to say to somebody,

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:29.227
"I'd like you to go over now
and lie to Congress"?

00:05:29.227 --> 00:05:31.931
-Not only is Trump dumb enough
to lie to the country,

00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:35.901
he's dumb enough to misspell
the word "country."

00:05:35.901 --> 00:05:38.637
And look, everybody --
everybody makes typos,

00:05:38.637 --> 00:05:40.440
but the president
should at least be able

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.107
to spell the thing
he's in charge of.

00:05:42.107 --> 00:05:45.077
Can you imagine if Steve Jobs
had made the same mistake

00:05:45.077 --> 00:05:46.612
when he launched Apple?

00:05:46.612 --> 00:05:48.114
[ Laughter ]

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:49.782
So the short answer
to all of this is,

00:05:49.782 --> 00:05:51.884
we don't know whether Trump
directed Michael Cohen

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:53.819
to lie to Congress about
the Trump Tower deal.

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:55.888
But we do know
that Trump himself

00:05:55.888 --> 00:05:57.990
has lied repeatedly
to everybody.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.526
And then this week, Trump's
current lawyer, Rudy Giuliani,

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:02.428
claimed it would have been
totally fine

00:06:02.428 --> 00:06:04.630
for the president to talk
to his former lawyer

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.366
about what he was going to say
in his testimony to Congress.

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:08.667
-As far as I know,

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:10.703
President Trump did not
have discussions with him,

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:12.571
certainly had no discussions
with him

00:06:12.571 --> 00:06:15.307
in which he told him
or counseled him to lie.

00:06:15.307 --> 00:06:17.009
If he had any discussions
with him,

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:18.945
they'd be about the version
of the events

00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:22.381
that Michael Cohen gave then,
which they all believe was true.

00:06:22.381 --> 00:06:24.616
-But you just acknowledged
that it's possible

00:06:24.616 --> 00:06:25.818
that President Trump

00:06:25.818 --> 00:06:27.819
talked to Michael Cohen
about his testimony.

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:29.288
-Which would be
perfectly normal!

00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:31.056
-No, it wouldn't!

00:06:31.056 --> 00:06:33.192
Nothing this president does
is normal.

00:06:33.192 --> 00:06:35.728
The guy couldn't figure out
how to close an umbrella,

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:38.030
and his first instinct
was to leave it outside.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.131
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:41.234
And, Rudy, I've got to say --

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.942
If you keep messing up
like this, Rudy,

00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:51.444
he might do the same to you.

00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:53.679
[ Laughter ]

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:55.314
Rudy's comments over the weekend

00:06:55.314 --> 00:06:57.550
raised more questions
than they answered.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.986
So in an attempt to clean up
the mess he made,

00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:01.687
he did an interview
with "The New Yorker,"

00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:05.490
and somehow it got much worse
and much weirder.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.227
Here's how "New Yorker"
staff writer Isaac Chotiner

00:07:08.227 --> 00:07:10.696
described the start
of his conversation with Rudy.

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:13.732
"On Monday afternoon, I called
Giuliani to try to understand

00:07:13.732 --> 00:07:16.268
what he was saying about
the Moscow negotiations.

00:07:16.268 --> 00:07:18.403
After telling me
that he only had a minute

00:07:18.403 --> 00:07:21.340
before getting into the shower,
he agreed to a conversation."

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:26.212
Why does he compulsively share
details no one wants to know?

00:07:26.212 --> 00:07:27.679
It's like he can't help himself.

00:07:27.679 --> 00:07:28.948
Every interview Rudy does

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:31.083
is like a call with
your grandfather in Florida.

00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:32.652
"How are you, Grandpa?"

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:35.654
"Well, I'm getting a shot
tomorrow in my back

00:07:35.654 --> 00:07:38.357
for sciatica, and the doctor
says I'm going to be sore

00:07:38.357 --> 00:07:42.161
for a couple of days,
so I got to use Aspercreme.

00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:44.663
But I got Preparation H
by accident,

00:07:44.663 --> 00:07:47.199
so I got to go back
to the pharmacy,

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:49.969
even though the lady there
was mean to me."

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:51.537
"All right, you know what?
That's great, Grandpa.

00:07:51.537 --> 00:07:52.604
I got to go."

00:07:52.604 --> 00:07:54.006
Giuliani then insisted

00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:57.076
he knew the BuzzFeed story
was false immediately,

00:07:57.076 --> 00:07:58.343
and in the process,

00:07:58.343 --> 00:08:01.480
he once again revealed something
he shouldn't have.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.881
Here's the exchange.

00:08:02.881 --> 00:08:05.084
"I can tell you from the moment
I read the story,

00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:06.618
I knew the story was false."

00:08:06.618 --> 00:08:07.820
"Because?"

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.889
"Because I have been through
all the tapes."

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:12.992
"Wait. What tapes
have you gone through?"

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:15.460
"I shouldn't have said tapes."

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.497
"So there were no tapes
you listened to, though?"

00:08:18.497 --> 00:08:19.665
"No tapes.

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:22.401
Well, I have listened to tapes.

00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:24.604
But none of them concern this."

00:08:24.604 --> 00:08:27.340
Jesus!

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:33.412
Rudy is like that guy
you play poker with

00:08:33.412 --> 00:08:35.180
who keeps turning his cards
around and going,

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.316
"Is this something?"

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:38.550
He just keeps rambling.

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:39.752
It doesn't matter
what you ask him.

00:08:39.752 --> 00:08:41.053
We've been waiting all this time

00:08:41.053 --> 00:08:42.654
for Mueller to tell us
what went down

00:08:42.654 --> 00:08:44.757
when all we needed to do
was point a camera at Rudy

00:08:44.757 --> 00:08:46.058
and ask him
what he had for dinner.

00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:48.260
"I went to a Spanish restaurant
and had tapas,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.862
but I thought the waiter said,
'Tapes.'

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:51.397
And then they said,
'No, it's tapas.'

00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:53.399
I said, 'It sounds like
you're saying "tapes."'

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:54.533
And they said, 'Tapes?'

00:08:54.533 --> 00:08:56.302
And I said, 'Yeah,
like the secret tapes

00:08:56.302 --> 00:08:57.703
of Trump colluding
with the Russians.'

00:08:57.703 --> 00:08:59.371
But they said, 'No, it's tapas,'

00:08:59.371 --> 00:09:02.407
and I said,
'Hey, you look familiar.'"

00:09:02.407 --> 00:09:04.410
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.580
The reason --
the very simple reason

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.650
their story keeps changing
is because they are lying.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:14.219
Rudy might be the worst at it,
but he's not alone.

00:09:14.219 --> 00:09:16.689
It's all out there for everyone
to see, including the president.

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:19.658
He must be watching all these
Rudy interviews and saying...

00:09:19.658 --> 00:09:21.293
-Quiet, quiet, quiet.

00:09:21.293 --> 00:09:22.895
-This has been "A Closer Look."

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:25.197
[ Cheers and applause ]
