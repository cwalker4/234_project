OF COURSE, IN THE RUN-UP TO THE
ELECTION, THE PRESIDENT HAS

00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:05.371 size:81% position:41%
STOKED FEAR OF IMMIGRANTS.

00:00:05.404 --> 00:00:08.708
BUT AT AN OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT
THIS AFTERNOON, HE STARTED BY

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:12.145 align:start position:0%
SAYING HE CARES ABOUT PEOPLE
FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:18.684 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; AMERICA IS A WELCOMING
COUNTRY, AND, UNDER MY

00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:19.952 align:start position:0%
LEADERSHIP, IT'S A WELCOMING
COUNTRY.

00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:21.154 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: GOOD PLAN, MR.
PRESIDENT!

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:23.756
WARM UP THE CROWD WITH A JOKE.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:24.690 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE WANTED

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:27.794 size:78% position:39%
IMMIGRATION LAWS CHANGED.

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:31.464 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WE DO A VERY GOOD JOB,
CONSIDERING THE LAWS ARE SO BAD.

00:00:31.497 --> 00:00:32.999 align:start position:0%
THEY'RE NOT ARCHAIC.

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:35.368 align:start position:0%
THEY'RE INCOMPETENT.

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:36.636 size:81% position:41%
IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE OLD.

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:39.105 align:start position:0%
THEY'RE JUST BAD.

00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:43.643 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: UNLIKE YOU, WHO IS
BOTH OLD AND BAD.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:49.615 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:52.919 align:start position:0%
TRUMP ALSO TIED IMMIGRATION TO
THE ECONOMY.

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:55.955 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; BUT THIS IS A PERILOUS
SITUATION, AND IT THREATENS TO

00:00:55.988 --> 00:00:58.191
BECOME EVEN MORE HAZARDOUS AS
OUR ECONOMY GETS BETTER AND

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
BETTER.

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:01.794
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: WAIT, ARE THINGS
HAZARDOUS, OR ARE THEY GETTING

00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:02.695 align:start position:0%
BETTER AND BETTER?

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:04.797 align:start position:0%
(AS TRUMP)
"YES, THINGS ARE GETTING SO BAD

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.768 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE THINGS ARE GOING SO
WELL.

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:10.670 align:start position:0%
AS I ALWAYS SAY, 'MAKE AMERICA
GREAT AGAIN, WHICH WILL BE

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:16.142 align:start position:0%
TERRIBLE!'"
( LAUGHTER )

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:17.844
AND HE REPEATED AN ALT-RIGHT
THEORY THAT EVERYONE ASKING FOR

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:22.115 align:start position:0%
ASYLUM IS JUST A CRIMINAL
READING A MEMORIZED STATEMENT.

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:24.117 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THEY NEVER HEARD OF THE
PHRASE BEFORE.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.085 align:start position:0%
THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN THE
PHRASE.

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:29.822 align:start position:0%
BUT THEY'RE GIVEN A LITTLE LEGAL
STATEMENT TO READ.

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:34.460 align:start position:0%
AND THEY READ IT.

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:36.596 align:start position:0%
AND NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO QUALIFY.

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:37.763 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: MY GOD, COULD YOU
BELIEVE SOMEONE TELLING A

00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:39.866 align:start position:0%
FEDERAL OFFICIAL A PHRASE THEY
DIDN'T BELIEVE IN?

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.368
&gt;&gt; PRESERVE, PROTECT AND DEFEND.

00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:46.272 align:start position:0%
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED
STATES.

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: THAT GUY SHOULD

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:48.374 align:start position:0%
DEFINITELY BE DEPORTED.

00:01:48.407 --> 00:01:50.776 align:start position:0%
YOU'VE GOT TO GET THAT GUY OUT
OF THIS COUNTRY.

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:53.880
I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT GUY WAS.

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:54.280 align:start position:0%
OUT!

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:56.549 align:start position:0%
OUT AMIGO!

00:01:56.582 --> 00:01:57.717
TRUMP SAYS THERE ARE ALREADY
LOTS OF UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE IN

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.352 align:start position:0%
THE COUNTRY.

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:04.223
&gt;&gt; MOST OF THESE PEOPLE, WE HAVE
NO IDEA HOW THEY GOT THERE, WHY

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:08.794
THEY GOT THERE, AND THE NUMBER
IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE A MUCH

00:02:08.827 --> 00:02:14.233 align:start position:0%
LARGER NUMBER AS WE LOOK AT ALL
OF THE DATA.

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:18.371 align:start position:0%
SO, IF YOU LOOK AT JUST A
MINIMAL NUMBER, IT'S THE SIZE OF

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:18.971 align:start position:0%
VERMONT.

00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:20.706 align:start position:0%

VERMONT AT ALL.

00:02:26.078 --> 00:02:28.247 align:start position:0%
THAT'S SCARY.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.118
WHAT STATE ARE THEY THE SIZE OF?

I DON'T KNOW.

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:36.155 align:start position:0%

POLICE, WHERE THEY BADLY HURT

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:11.958

THAT.

00:03:44.657 --> 00:03:48.928
WHEN THEY THROW ROCKS LIKE THEY
DID AT THE MEXICO MILITARY AND

00:03:48.961 --> 00:03:53.599 align:start position:0%

00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:02.688
THE PRESIDENT HEARS ABOUT HIS

00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:09.695
&gt;&gt; I THINK WE'VE HAD TREMENDOUS
SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF PRAYER,

00:07:09.728 --> 00:07:10.963
