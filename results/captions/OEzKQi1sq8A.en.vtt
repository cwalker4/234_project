YES.

00:04:31.003 --> 00:04:32.338 size:81% position:41%
IT'S TRUE, VERY IMPORTANT.

&gt;&gt; THE WITCH HUNT CONTINUES.

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:56.462 align:start position:0%
THE FACT IS THAT, I GUESS, WE
GOT 81 LETTERS.

00:04:56.495 --> 00:04:57.863 align:start position:0%
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION.

00:04:57.896 --> 00:05:00.066 align:start position:0%
IT WAS A HOAX.

&gt;&gt; Stephen: IT'S JUST SAD WHEN
HIS HEART'S NOT IN IT.

00:05:05.437 --> 00:05:07.840

00:05:40.372 --> 00:05:42.508 align:start position:0%
TRUMP TRIED HIS BEST TO STAY
POSITIVE.

00:05:42.541 --> 00:05:44.877
&gt;&gt; PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN
THEY LOOK AT IT, THEY JUST SAY,

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:45.845 size:81% position:41%
"PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT."

00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:47.747 align:start position:0%
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.685 align:start position:0%
NO ADMINISTRATION HAS
ACCOMPLISHED-- PROBABLY YOU

00:05:52.718 --> 00:05:56.455 size:88% position:44%
COULD SAY THIS WITH ABSOLUTE
CERTAINTY-- IN THE FIRST TWO

00:05:56.488 --> 00:05:58.324 align:start position:0%
YEARS ANYWHERE NEAR WHAT WE'VE
ACCOMPLISHED.

00:05:58.357 --> 00:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: REALLY?

00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:06.198 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )</i>
THERE'S A REPORT OUT ON DAY 149

00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:07.833 align:start position:0%
OF GEORGE WASHINGTON'S
PRESIDENCY.

00:06:07.866 --> 00:06:10.503
THEY PASSED THE BILL OF RIGHTS.

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:16.108
AND IT'S TAKEN YOU ALMOST TWO
YEARS TO VIOLATE ALL OF THEM.

00:06:16.141 --> 00:06:25.351 align:start position:0%
<i> ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</i>
OF COURSE, YESTERDAY, HE SAID HE

00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:28.354
WAS GOING TO COOPERATE WITH ALL
OF THE DOCUMENT REQUESTS FROM

00:06:28.387 --> 00:06:29.555 align:start position:0%
CONGRESS.

00:06:29.588 --> 00:06:32.158
BUT TODAY, HE CHANGED HIS MIND
AND IN DOING SO, HE CITED HIS

00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:34.360 size:81% position:41%
FAVORITE FORMER PRESIDENT.

00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:40.166 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; PRESIDENT OBAMA, FROM WHAT
THEY TELL ME, WAS UNDER A

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.967 align:start position:0%
SIMILAR KIND OF THING, DIDN'T
GIVE ONE LETTER.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.868 size:75% position:38%
THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

00:06:42.901 --> 00:06:44.270 align:start position:0%
THEY DIDN'T GIVE ONE LETTER OF
THE REQUEST.

00:06:44.303 --> 00:06:45.037 size:75% position:38%
MANY REQUESTS WERE MADE.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.006 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HE'S RIGHT.

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:48.140 align:start position:0%
HE'S RIGHT.

00:06:48.174 --> 00:06:51.377 align:start position:0%
