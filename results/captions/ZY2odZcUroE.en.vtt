00:00:01.657 --> 00:00:01.989
SHANNON?

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:02.890
&gt;&gt; Shannon: KRISTIN FISHER,

00:00:02.891 --> 00:00:03.858
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:05.493
TWO BIG STORIES OUT OF D.C.

00:00:05.494 --> 00:00:09.130
TONIGHT, LET'S BREAK THEM DOWN.

00:00:09.131 --> 00:00:09.730
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN

00:00:09.731 --> 00:00:10.464
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ FACING

00:00:10.465 --> 00:00:11.198
ALLEGATIONS THAT COULD LAND HER

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:12.400
IN SERIOUS LEGAL TROUBLE.

00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:13.334
FOX NEWS CAUGHT UP WITH HER

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:14.335
TODAY AND ASK     ASKED THE CONR

00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:14.368
TODAY AND ASK     ASKED THE CONS

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:14.402
TODAY AND ASK     ASKED THE CONM

00:00:14.403 --> 00:00:14.635
TODAY AND ASK     ASKED THE CONN

00:00:14.636 --> 00:00:17.038
ABOUT A COMPLAINT FILED BY A

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:17.705
CONSERVATIVE WATCHDOG THAT

00:00:17.706 --> 00:00:19.774
CLAIMS SHE AND HER CHIEF OF

00:00:19.775 --> 00:00:21.876
STAFF VIOLATED CAMPAIGN FINANCE

00:00:21.877 --> 00:00:23.311
LAW.

00:00:23.312 --> 00:00:26.514
&gt;&gt; DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THE

00:00:26.515 --> 00:00:27.648
FEC VIOLATIONS FILED AGAINST

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:28.049
YOUR OFFICE?

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.484
&gt;&gt; THERE IS NO VIOLATION.

00:00:30.485 --> 00:00:33.454
&gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK THAT IS A SIGN

00:00:33.455 --> 00:00:34.088
OF YOU TAKING DARK MONEY?

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:36.290
&gt;&gt; OH, NO, NO.

00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:38.726
&gt;&gt; LET'S BRING IN THE FORMER

00:00:38.727 --> 00:00:39.393
CHIEF COUNSEL FOR THE HOUSE

00:00:39.394 --> 00:00:40.861
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, JULIAN

00:00:40.862 --> 00:00:41.195
EPSTEIN.

00:00:41.196 --> 00:00:42.396
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPOND IT FOR

00:00:42.397 --> 00:00:43.064
THE CALLER.

00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:46.667
AND FROM THE HERITAGE

00:00:46.668 --> 00:00:48.102
FOUNDATION, FORMER MEMBER OF THE

00:00:48.103 --> 00:00:49.070
FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION

00:00:49.071 --> 00:00:49.403
HIMSELF.

00:00:49.404 --> 00:00:50.705
HANS, I WILL START WITH YOU,

00:00:50.706 --> 00:00:52.106
YOU'VE SEEN THE FILINGS, WHAT

00:00:52.107 --> 00:00:53.874
YOU MAKE OF THE CASE SO FAR?

00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:55.576
&gt;&gt; THEY ARE POTENTIALLY VERY

00:00:55.577 --> 00:00:56.911
SERIOUS VIOLATIONS HERE.

00:00:56.912 --> 00:00:59.313
SHE HAD HER CHIEF OF STAFF OR IN

00:00:59.314 --> 00:01:01.282
LEGAL CONTROL OF A POLITICAL

00:01:01.283 --> 00:01:01.983
ACTION COMMITTEE, SO THERE IS

00:01:01.984 --> 00:01:05.252
POTENTIAL FOR NOT ONLY ILLEGAL

00:01:05.253 --> 00:01:08.489
CONTRIBUTIONS THAT BENEFITED HER

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.257
CAMPAIGN, ILLEGAL COORDINATION,

00:01:10.258 --> 00:01:11.325
AND ALSO REPORTING VIOLATIONS,

00:01:11.326 --> 00:01:12.093
THERE IS CERTAINLY ENOUGH THERE

00:01:12.094 --> 00:01:15.463
FOR THE FEC TO OPEN UP AN

00:01:15.464 --> 00:01:17.531
INVESTIGATION, AND IF IT LOOKS

00:01:17.532 --> 00:01:19.133
LIKE THIS WAS AN INTENTIONAL AND

00:01:19.134 --> 00:01:20.735
KNOWING VIOLATION, THERE WOULD

00:01:20.736 --> 00:01:21.502
BE POTENTIAL FOR THE JUSTICE

00:01:21.503 --> 00:01:23.137
DEPARTMENT TO OPEN UP A CRIMINAL

00:01:23.138 --> 00:01:23.671
VIOLATION.

00:01:23.672 --> 00:01:24.705
&gt;&gt; Shannon: A SEPARATE FROM

00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:26.273
THE FEC BASED ON WHAT THEY

00:01:26.274 --> 00:01:29.377
FOUND?

00:01:29.378 --> 00:01:30.111
"THE WASHINGTON TIMES" HAS THIS

00:01:30.112 --> 00:01:30.845
IN THEIR ARTICLE TODAY, SAYING

00:01:30.846 --> 00:01:32.847
IT APPEARS SHE IS INVOLVED IN A

00:01:32.848 --> 00:01:33.481
SELF-DEALING ARRANGEMENT,

00:01:33.482 --> 00:01:35.916
PARTICULARLY TROUBLESOME FOR

00:01:35.917 --> 00:01:37.018
MS. OCASIO-CORTEZ BECAUSE

00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:38.552
THE NEW YORK DEMOCRAT PRESENTS

00:01:38.553 --> 00:01:39.186
HERSELF AS A WORKING CLASS

00:01:39.187 --> 00:01:41.589
CHAMPION AGAINST A CORRUPTING

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.759
SPECIAL INTEREST.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.092
JULIAN?

00:01:45.093 --> 00:01:46.861
&gt;&gt; LOOK, THE DETAILS OF THIS ARE

00:01:46.862 --> 00:01:49.130
VERY, VERY SKETCHY AT THIS

00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:49.897
POINT.

00:01:49.898 --> 00:01:51.499
90% OF THE FACTS THAT WE DON'T

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.267
KNOW AND 10% THAT HAVE BEEN

00:01:53.268 --> 00:01:53.901
ALLEGED.

00:01:53.902 --> 00:01:55.436
IF THEY DO ARISE TO SOMETHING

00:01:55.437 --> 00:01:56.637
THAT IS CREDIBLE, I THINK IT

00:01:56.638 --> 00:01:57.905
SHOULD BE HANDLED THE WAY

00:01:57.906 --> 00:01:58.572
EVERYTHING ELSE SHOULD BE

00:01:58.573 --> 00:02:00.608
HANDLED WHEN THERE IS A

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:01.242
SUGGESTION OF A SCANDAL OR

00:02:01.243 --> 00:02:03.644
SOMETHING IMPROPER.

00:02:03.645 --> 00:02:05.913
THERE SHOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE

00:02:05.914 --> 00:02:06.347
INVESTIGATION.

00:02:06.348 --> 00:02:07.314
AND I DON'T THINK, WHETHER IT IS

00:02:07.315 --> 00:02:09.650
TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE,

00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:10.651
WHETHER AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS,

00:02:10.652 --> 00:02:14.221
I THINK THE IDEA OF TRYING TO

00:02:14.222 --> 00:02:15.222
ARGUE AGAINST AN INVESTIGATION

00:02:15.223 --> 00:02:18.492
WHEN THERE IS CREDIBLE -- IF

00:02:18.493 --> 00:02:19.493
THERE ARE CREDIBLE ACCUSATIONS,

00:02:19.494 --> 00:02:21.595
IS JUST A LOSE-LOSE ARGUMENT.

00:02:21.596 --> 00:02:22.329
&gt;&gt; Shannon: HOW MUCH OF THIS

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.266
DO YOU THINK IS INEXPERIENCE

00:02:25.267 --> 00:02:26.500
VERSUS THAT SHE AND HER CHIEF OF

00:02:26.501 --> 00:02:27.435
STAFF BEING IN CAHOOTS AND

00:02:27.436 --> 00:02:28.569
TRYING TO SCAM THE SYSTEM,

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.304
KNOWING EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE

00:02:30.305 --> 00:02:31.072
LOOKING AT THEM?

00:02:31.073 --> 00:02:32.540
&gt;&gt; I SPOKE TO A REPUBLICAN CLOSE

00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:33.240
TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND TALKED

00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:35.543
ABOUT HOW THEY POINTED OUT THAT

00:02:35.544 --> 00:02:36.510
INEXPERIENCE COULD POINT TO BOTH

00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:39.447
THIS AND THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE

00:02:39.448 --> 00:02:41.549
VIOLATION, ALLEGED

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.150
CAMPAIGN FINANCE ALLEGATION THAT

00:02:43.151 --> 00:02:44.719
THE CONGRESSWOMAN WAS GRILLING

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.587
MICHAEL COHEN ABOUT, WITH REGARD

00:02:46.588 --> 00:02:47.655
TO THE PRESIDENT.

00:02:47.656 --> 00:02:48.956
IN BOTH CASES, IT IS CLEAR THAT

00:02:48.957 --> 00:02:51.792
THESE THINGS COULD BOTH BE A

00:02:51.793 --> 00:02:53.094
MATTER OF INEXPERIENCE, IT COULD

00:02:53.095 --> 00:02:56.097
BE A MATTER OF INEPTITUDE, BUT

00:02:56.098 --> 00:02:57.932
BECAUSE OF OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM,

00:02:57.933 --> 00:02:58.933
BOTH HAVE BECOME HIGH-PROFILE

00:02:58.934 --> 00:03:00.301
CASES AND SHE IS ALSO IN HOT

00:03:00.302 --> 00:03:01.635
WATER FOR SOMETHING SIMILAR COME

00:03:01.636 --> 00:03:01.969
HERSELF.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.773
&gt;&gt; ONE THING WE AGREE ON

00:03:05.774 --> 00:03:08.275
PROBABLY IS WHAT IS AND IS NOT A

00:03:08.276 --> 00:03:08.976
CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION IS

00:03:08.977 --> 00:03:11.245
NOTORIOUSLY VAGUE.

00:03:11.246 --> 00:03:13.214
POORLY DEFINED, SOMETIMES

00:03:13.215 --> 00:03:18.018
DEFINED BY THE FEC VIOLATIONS,

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.955
POSSIBLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL FOR

00:03:20.956 --> 00:03:22.056
VAGUENESS.

00:03:22.057 --> 00:03:22.890
MICHAEL: PROBABLY WOULD NEVER

00:03:22.891 --> 00:03:26.093
HAVE BEEN CONVICTED BY A

00:03:26.094 --> 00:03:27.394
JURY BECAUSE THE LAW IS THAT

00:03:27.395 --> 00:03:30.464
AMBIGUOUS ON THE HUSH MONEY.

00:03:30.465 --> 00:03:31.198
&gt;&gt; Shannon: THERE ARE CASES

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:33.134
THAT SHOW THAT IS A MASS AND

00:03:33.135 --> 00:03:34.034
SOMETHING WE NEED MORE.

00:03:34.035 --> 00:03:36.470
&gt;&gt; WE ARE LONG OVERDUE FOR A

00:03:36.471 --> 00:03:37.938
CLARIFICATION OF WHAT IS AND IS

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:39.273
NOT A CAMPING VIOLATION.

00:03:39.274 --> 00:03:40.274
&gt;&gt; Shannon: I'M SURE THE

00:03:40.275 --> 00:03:41.709
CONGRESSWOMAN DOESN'T WANT TO BE

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.443
SUBJECT OF THAT CASE BEAR THE

00:03:42.444 --> 00:03:43.778
PRESIDENT PUSHING BACK AS HE

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:47.915
SAYS THIS IS A DISGRACE, AN

00:03:47.916 --> 00:03:50.017
EXPEDITION GOING AFTER HIM, HIS

00:03:50.018 --> 00:03:51.519
BUSINESSES, HIS FAN KNOW MY FAML

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.552
BUSINESSES, HIS FAN KNOW MY FAM,

00:03:51.553 --> 00:03:51.585
BUSINESSES, HIS FAN KNOW MY FAMC

00:03:51.586 --> 00:03:51.619
BUSINESSES, HIS FAN KNOW MY FAMN

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.652
BUSINESSES, HIS FAN KNOW MY FAMR

00:03:51.653 --> 00:03:51.685
BUSINESSES, HIS FAN KNOW MY FAMS

00:03:51.686 --> 00:03:51.719
BUSINESSES, HIS FAN KNOW MY FAMM

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.752
BUSINESSES, HIS FAN KNOW MY FAMN

00:03:51.753 --> 00:03:51.786
BUSINESSES, HIS FAN KNOW MY FAMT

00:03:51.787 --> 00:03:51.819
BUSINESSES, HIS FAN KNOW MY FAME

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.852
BUSINESSES, HIS FAN KNOW MY FAMT

00:03:51.853 --> 00:03:51.886
BUSINESSES, HIS FAN KNOW MY FAMN

00:03:51.887 --> 00:03:53.287
BUSINESSES, HIS FAN KNOW MY FAMG

00:03:53.288 --> 00:03:55.289
THIS, IT DOESN'T MEAN IT IS A

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.457
FISHING EXPEDITION, IT MEANS

00:03:56.458 --> 00:03:57.525
THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF POTENTIAL

00:03:57.526 --> 00:03:59.794
FISH TO CATCH.

00:03:59.795 --> 00:04:01.228
HANS, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:02.463
CALLING THIS THE PREIMPEACHMENT

00:04:02.464 --> 00:04:02.763
PHASE.

00:04:02.764 --> 00:04:04.298
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT?

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.768
&gt;&gt; CONGRESS DOES HAVE A LOT OF

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:08.903
AUTHORITY TO OVERSIGHT, DO

00:04:08.904 --> 00:04:10.437
INVESTIGATIONS, BUT THAT IS

00:04:10.438 --> 00:04:11.572
USUALLY RELATED TO HOW THE

00:04:11.573 --> 00:04:12.273
EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS OPERATING

00:04:12.274 --> 00:04:14.642
UNDER THE MONEY APPROPRIATED FOR

00:04:14.643 --> 00:04:14.909
IT.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.112
AND ALSO, IF NEW LEGISLATION IS

00:04:18.113 --> 00:04:18.512
NEEDED.

00:04:18.513 --> 00:04:19.713
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THAT HERE,

00:04:19.714 --> 00:04:23.517
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY SPECIFIC

00:04:23.518 --> 00:04:24.552
EVIDENCE OF ACTUAL VIOLATIONS OF

00:04:24.553 --> 00:04:26.453
THE LAW, WHICH IS USUALLY A

00:04:26.454 --> 00:04:27.454
BASIS BEFORE YOU START

00:04:27.455 --> 00:04:27.888
INVESTIGATION.

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.990
I HAVE TO SAY, ADAM SCHIFF SEEMS

00:04:29.991 --> 00:04:34.061
TO BE COPYING JOSEPH McCARTHY

00:04:34.062 --> 00:04:35.129
AND WANTING TO OPEN UP

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.330
INVESTIGATIONS WHERE THEY DON'T

00:04:36.331 --> 00:04:37.598
ACTUALLY HAVE ANY EVIDENCE OF

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:38.065
ANY WRONGDOING.

00:04:38.066 --> 00:04:39.500
&gt;&gt; Shannon: WELL, HE SAYS THEY

00:04:39.501 --> 00:04:40.668
DO WHEN HE HAS A GUT FEELING

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:41.902
ABOUT IT THERE THEY KEEP SAYING

00:04:41.903 --> 00:04:44.305
WE NEED MORE FACTS, BUT MAKING

00:04:44.306 --> 00:04:45.272
ALLEGATIONS IN THE MEANTIME.

00:04:45.273 --> 00:04:47.441
STEVEN COLLINS SAID IT IS BASIC

00:04:47.442 --> 00:04:48.142
POLITICS FOR DEMOCRATS NOT TO

00:04:48.143 --> 00:04:50.477
CALL THEIR INVESTIGATIONS AND

00:04:50.478 --> 00:04:51.512
IMPEACHMENT DRIVE RIGHT NOW.

00:04:51.513 --> 00:04:53.514
TO DO SO WOULD HAND THE G.O.P. A

00:04:53.515 --> 00:04:55.916
GIFT AS A CLAIM THAT IT IS

00:04:55.917 --> 00:04:58.252
ALREADY IN.

00:04:58.253 --> 00:04:59.119
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE SEVERAL CONGRESSMEN

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.522
WHO HAVE COME OUT AND SAID THEY

00:05:01.523 --> 00:05:02.857
BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT HAS

00:05:02.858 --> 00:05:03.457
OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE, THE

00:05:03.458 --> 00:05:04.225
PRESTATEMENTS PRIOR TO THE ISSUE

00:05:04.226 --> 00:05:05.893
OF THIS.

00:05:05.894 --> 00:05:07.628
IT'S INTERESTING, WHAT KRISTIN

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:09.063
WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER WITH

00:05:09.064 --> 00:05:10.931
THE PRESIDENT'S STRATEGY TO

00:05:10.932 --> 00:05:11.899
THIS, HE IS CITING

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.100
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE

00:05:13.101 --> 00:05:13.801
PRIVILEGE, THAT IS SOMETHING

00:05:13.802 --> 00:05:15.069
THAT DID NOT WORK OUT FOR

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.103
PRESIDENT OBAMA WHEN HE CITED

00:05:16.104 --> 00:05:16.871
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE WHEN IT CAME

00:05:16.872 --> 00:05:18.672
TO THE FAST AND FURIOUS CASE.

00:05:18.673 --> 00:05:20.674
IT IS SETTING DOWN FOR A BIG

00:05:20.675 --> 00:05:21.609
SHOWDOWN WITH THE WHITE HOUSE.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.043
&gt;&gt; Shannon: THEY TWEETED THIS

00:05:23.044 --> 00:05:25.312
TODAY ABOUT ALL THESE REQUESTS,

00:05:25.313 --> 00:05:27.848
SPECIAL COUNSEL MUELLER HAS HAD

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:28.849
RESOURCES THAT GO FAR BEYOND

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.451
WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO THE

00:05:30.452 --> 00:05:31.085
CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE.

00:05:31.086 --> 00:05:32.653
IF MUELLER FINDS NO COLLUSION,

00:05:32.654 --> 00:05:38.125
IS IT LIKELY SHIFF AND HIS

00:05:38.126 --> 00:05:39.660
BOILER WILL BE ABLE TO, JULIAN?

00:05:39.661 --> 00:05:42.429
&gt;&gt; THERE'S A LOT TO UNPACK HERE,

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.633
BUT THE QUESTION ON

00:05:45.634 --> 00:05:46.333
OCASIO-CORTEZ ON THE CAMPAIGN

00:05:46.334 --> 00:05:47.601
VIOLENCE VIOLATION, IT SEEMS

00:05:47.602 --> 00:05:48.202
UNTENABLE TO ARGUE THERE

00:05:48.203 --> 00:05:50.237
SHOULDN'T BE INVESTIGATIONS.

00:05:50.238 --> 00:05:51.705
YOU HAVE 37 INDICTMENTS OR

00:05:51.706 --> 00:05:55.309
GUILTY PLEAS AT THIS POINT, OVER

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.210
100 DOCUMENTED CONTACTS DURING

00:05:56.211 --> 00:05:58.112
THE TRUMP TRANSITION WITH THE

00:05:58.113 --> 00:05:58.479
RUSSIANS.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.146
&gt;&gt; Shannon: DON'T THINK THE

00:05:59.147 --> 00:06:00.814
SPECIAL COUNSEL WILL BE ABLE TO

00:06:00.815 --> 00:06:01.615
HANDLE THIS?

00:06:01.616 --> 00:06:03.250
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE DIFFERENT PER VIEWS

00:06:03.251 --> 00:06:03.684
AND FUNCTIONS.

00:06:03.685 --> 00:06:06.387
AS HANS JUST SAID, SOMETIMES A

00:06:06.388 --> 00:06:07.087
DEMOCRATIC INVESTIGATION WILL

00:06:07.088 --> 00:06:08.555
LOOK TO HAVE LEGISLATIVE REFORM,

00:06:08.556 --> 00:06:10.658
AND THERE ARE HALF-DOZEN THAT I

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:12.059
CAN THINK THAT COULD POTENTIALLY

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.626
COME OUT OF THIS.

00:06:12.627 --> 00:06:15.296
37 INDICTMENTS OR GUILTY PLEAS,

00:06:15.297 --> 00:06:17.097
100 CONTACTS.

00:06:17.098 --> 00:06:18.499
&gt;&gt; Shannon: WHY DID THEY NEED

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.267
TO GO BACK AND TO ALL OF THE

00:06:20.268 --> 00:06:21.268
SAME REQUEST FOR DOCUMENTS AND

00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:22.436
THE SAME PEOPLE IN THE SAME

00:06:22.437 --> 00:06:24.338
INFORMATION?

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:25.739
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THIS CONGRESS LOOKS

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.474
AT IT THREE DIFFERENT LENS THAN

00:06:27.475 --> 00:06:28.008
A SPECIAL COUNSEL.

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:30.411
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL IS

00:06:30.412 --> 00:06:31.211
LOOKING -- NOT NECESSARILY.

00:06:31.212 --> 00:06:33.714
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL IS LOOKING

00:06:33.715 --> 00:06:35.516
AT WHETHER TO PROSECUTE OR NOT

00:06:35.517 --> 00:06:36.951
PROSECUTE, PERIOD, AND A CASE.

00:06:36.952 --> 00:06:39.153
IT COULD MAKE A DEMOCRAT MIKE

00:06:39.154 --> 00:06:41.455
RECOMMENDATION ON IMPEACHMENT.

00:06:41.456 --> 00:06:43.424
CONGRESS COULD BE LOOKING AT

00:06:43.425 --> 00:06:44.725
IMPEACHMENT, IT MIGHT BE MADE,

00:06:44.726 --> 00:06:46.193
WE HAVE TO SEE WITH THE FACTS

00:06:46.194 --> 00:06:47.461
SHOW, CONGRESS COULD LOOK AT A

00:06:47.462 --> 00:06:48.162
WHOLE HOST OF OTHER REFORMS,

00:06:48.163 --> 00:06:51.799
LOOKING AT ENFORCEMENT ON THE

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.800
EMOLUMENTS CLAUSE, A STATUTORY

00:06:52.801 --> 00:06:55.669
BASIS FOR PROSECUTION OF A

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:56.637
PRESIDENT WHEN HE LEAVES OFFICE.

00:06:56.638 --> 00:06:59.139
YOU ARE TALKING WITH THE 100

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.474
CONTACTS THAT HAD WITH THE

00:07:00.475 --> 00:07:01.976
RUSSIANS IN THE CAMPAIGN AND

00:07:01.977 --> 00:07:03.177
TRANSITION, SHARING OF

00:07:03.178 --> 00:07:05.579
INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION, THE

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.182
TRUMP TEAM MEETING WITH RUSSIAN

00:07:08.183 --> 00:07:08.549
OFFICIALS.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:09.616
HE &gt;&gt; Shannon: ALL THINGS THE

00:07:09.617 --> 00:07:10.951
SPECIAL COUNSEL IS LOOKING AT.

00:07:10.952 --> 00:07:13.887
&gt;&gt; BUT THERE IS A REASON FOR

00:07:13.888 --> 00:07:16.056
CONGRESS TO HAVE A SEPARATE

00:07:16.057 --> 00:07:16.523
PROCESS.

00:07:16.524 --> 00:07:18.659
ONE IS BECAUSE IT MAY BE LOOKING

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:19.460
AT LEGISLATIVE REFORM.

00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:21.729
AT TWO'S IF YOU'RE TO DO

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.063
SOMETHING, ULTIMATELY A DECISION

00:07:23.064 --> 00:07:24.598
OF PROSECUTION OF THE PRESENT OR

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:25.899
SOMEBODY ELSE, IMPEACHMENT,

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.734
SOMETHING ELSE, IF YOU MAKE A

00:07:26.735 --> 00:07:29.503
PUBLIC CASE ON THIS.

00:07:29.504 --> 00:07:31.605
THE FEDERALIST PAPERS 65 WERE

00:07:31.606 --> 00:07:34.308
VERY INSTRUCTIVE ON THE SUBJECT

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:35.042
OF IMPEACHMENT FROM A POLITICAL

00:07:35.043 --> 00:07:37.011
QUESTION FOR ME TO MAKE A

00:07:37.012 --> 00:07:38.245
POLITICAL CASE TO THE BODY

00:07:38.246 --> 00:07:38.912
POLITIC ANY PUBLIC PAIRED

00:07:38.913 --> 00:07:40.447
&gt;&gt; Shannon: A NUMBER OF

00:07:40.448 --> 00:07:42.049
DEMOCRATS INCLUDING THE

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.451
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SAYING
