00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:16.619
One evening in the spring of 1905 Albert Einstein then a mere patent clerk in Bern after trudging through his days work

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.139
Decided to board a tram car on his way home

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.120
Einstein would often wrap up his work as soon as possible to contemplate the truths of the universe in his free time

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:34.988
It was one of these thought experiments he devised on that tram car that revolutionized modern physics forever

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:43.869
While receding away from the Zytglogge clock tower Einstein imagined, what would happen if the tram car were receding at the speed of light

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.540
He realized that if he were to travel at

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.819
186,000 miles per second the clocks hands would appear to completely freeze

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.899
At the same time Einstein knew that back at the clock tower the hands would tick along at their normal pace

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.159
For Einstein time had slowed down. This thought blew his mind.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:14.460
Einstein concluded that the faster you move through space the slower you move through time. How is this possible?

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.950
Einstein's work was heavily influenced by two of the most iconic physicists of all time

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:27.939
First there were the laws of motion discovered by his idol Isaac Newton and second were the laws of electromagnetism

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.490
laid down by James Clerk Maxwell

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.420
Newton's laws insisted that velocities are never absolute

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.390
But always relative, so that their magnitudes must be appended by the phrase "with respect to"

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.810
For instance a train travels at 40 km/h with respect to someone at rest

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:56.119
However, it only travels 20 km/h with respect to a train traveling 20 km/h in the same direction

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.159
Or it travels 60 km/h with respect to another train traveling in the opposite direction at 20 km/h

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.059
This is also true for the velocities of Earth, the Sun and the entire Milky Way galaxy

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.099
On the other hand Maxwell found that the speed of an electromagnetic wave such as light is fixed at an exorbitant

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.319
299,792,458 m/s regardless of who observes it

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.190
however

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.679
Maxwell's notion seems incompatible with Newton's notion of relative velocities

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.420
If Newton's laws are truly universal. Why should the speed of life be an exception?

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.780
This presented Einstein with a daunting dilemma

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.670
This conflict between the ideas of Newton and Maxwell can be demonstrated with another of Einstein's brilliant thought experiments

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.869
Einstein imagined himself on a train platform witnessing two lightning bolts strike on either side of him

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.309
Now because Einstein stands precisely in the middle of the two strikes

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.299
He receives the resulting beams of light from both sides at the same time

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:15.070
However things get more complicated when someone on a passing train views this event while whizzing past Einstein at the speed of light

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.380
If the speed of light conforms to the rules of relativity, then the person on the train wouldn't witness the lightning strike simultaneously

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.140
Logically the light closer to the man on the train would reach him first

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:37.500
A measurement of the speed of light made by both men would differ in magnitude, this would contradict an apparently fundamental truth of the universe

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:46.500
Einstein had to make a difficult choice. Either Newton's laws were incomplete or the speed of light was not a universal constant

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.110
Einstein realized that the two notions could coexist with a small tweak in Newton's laws

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.470
To get rid of the discrepancy in the measurements Einstein suggested the time itself for the man on the train

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.319
Must slow down to compensate for the decrease in speed such that the magnitude remains a constant

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.640
Einstein called this absurdity "Time Dilation" and his newfound theory "Special Relativity"

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.419
Newton believed the time moved unflinchingly in a single direction forward

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.049
Einstein however had just realized the time stretches and contracts varying with velocity

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.920
Due to its malleability time like space

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.739
Deserved its own dimension in fact Einstein claimed that the two were one and the same

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.140
together they formed a four-dimensional fabric or continuum called space-time

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.830
upon which the mundane events of the universe would unfold

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.299
Einstein Suggested that massive objects like the Sun didn't pull bodies like earth with a mysterious

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.889
Inexplicable tug, but rather curved the fabric of space-time around them

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.549
Forcing earth to fall down into this steep valley

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.830
A highly simplified analogy is the dip in a trampoline made by a falling bowling ball

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.099
If a marble were placed on that trampoline the marble would immediately roll towards the bowling ball in the center

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.240
This is also true for Earth's gravity

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:21.930
We are pinned to the ground because space so distorted by the Earth's mass pushes us down from above

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.490
however the slump in the fabric around Earth is not uniform and

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.859
Earth's gravity grows more intense as we move towards its center where the curvature is at a maximum

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:41.028
Therefore like the marble on the trampoline an object that falls towards the earth accelerates as it races towards the center of the planet

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.449
It falls faster when just above the surface than it does say when it is slightly above the atmosphere

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:54.259
But hey according to special relativity the faster you move through space the slower you move through time

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:59.449
This means that time runs slower on Earth's surface than it does above the atmosphere

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.039
Now

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.558
Because different planets have different masses and thus different gravitational strengths

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:13.129
They also accelerate objects at different rates as we have learned this means a variable passage of time

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:19.758
This is what happens in the movie interstellar when the protagonists land on a planet in the proximity of a black hole

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.809
The gravity on the planet is so severe that one hour on the surface is equivalent to seven years on earth

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.330
To understand how motion affects time let's consider the simplest timekeeping mechanism

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.909
A second passes each time the photon is reflected

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:45.570
Let's imagine two people one in a spaceship slightly above Earth's atmosphere and the second on top of a small hill

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.940
Just above the Earth's surface

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.179
Both are watching a man fall from space towards the ground

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.390
Let's say that the falling man is carrying the photon clock explained a moment ago

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.230
What do each of the two men observe as the man falls past them?

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:07.670
What they observe is eerily similar to what a stationary person would observe when watching a ball bounce in a moving train.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:14.209
As the man falls from space, the light in his clock would appear to move in triangles to the two observers

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.750
This would mean that the light travels a longer distance

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.869
consequently stretching the duration of a second

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:26.390
It is obvious that the length of triangles the light traces and therefore the duration of a second is

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.999
proportional to the velocity of the falling man

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:34.189
When we recall that objects closer to the center of the planet fall faster

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.999
We can determine the time would appear to pass slower to the man on the hill

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.999
Than it does to the man in the spaceship above. Of course the difference is infinitesimal

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:50.690
The difference between the time measured by clocks at the tops of mountains and at the surface of Earth is a matter of nanoseconds

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:58.280
time dilation affects every clock whether it relies on basic electromagnetism or a complex combination of

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:04.339
Electromagnetism and Newton's laws of motion. In fact even biological processes are slowed down

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.809
Yes, that's right your head is slightly older than your feet
