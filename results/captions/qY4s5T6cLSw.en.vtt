00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.060
If you've never had the opportunity

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.340
to own a home,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.380
this is a once in a lifetime

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.440
dream come true opportunity.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.820
Detroit is building the country's first

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.900
tiny home community to help low income

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.400
residents become homeowners.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.120
It was started by Reverend Faith Fowler,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.400
who turned a personal loss into a gift

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.400
for her community.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.040
- When my mom died,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.200
if I inherited some things,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.240
and it was really the
first time in my life

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.680
I understood that if you're poor

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.240
when your parents die,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.400
they can't leave you anything.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.020
So I started looking
for a way that we could

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.240
provide the safety net
for really poor people,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.840
who had an income but not enough to ever

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.900
climb the economic ladder
that most of us do.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.380
And tiny homes just fit the bill.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.380
Many people are fixated on the fact that

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.480
they're so darn cute.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.140
But for me it's that economic mobility

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.000
that we're able to offer folks,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.500
and give them a chance to
have the American dream.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.940
- [Voiceover] Detroit
has one of the highest

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.460
poverty rates in the country.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.200
About 36%.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.600
Here, homelessness is a major problem.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.740
- In the city of Detroit,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.420
there's anywhere from 15,000 to 20,000

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.180
homeless men, women, and children.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.860
Detroit's 139,000 square miles.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.280
It's a huge city.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.900
We had 80,000 abandoned buildings.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.040
Because of the auto industry,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.100
people could get living wage
jobs with decent benefits,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.100
and have enough to buy a nice house.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.520
But many of those jobs are now gone.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.280
So this is Detroit too.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.080
- [Voiceover] This is the Boston Edison

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.200
Historic District.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.180
Many of its mansions were
once home to auto magnates

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.680
during the city's hey
day in the early 1900's.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.920
- You can see a very great contrast to the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.680
neighborhood we just drove through.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.860
And so we have this gap,

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.480
tremendous gap.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.480
I call Detroit the land of opportunity.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.360
We have plenty of land
and if we look at it

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.280
as an opportunity, then tremendous things

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.160
can be done in terms of housing.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.260
- [Voiceover] Faith runs the non-profit,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.280
Cass Community Social Services.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.800
The agency is the force
behind building this

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.740
tiny community.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.540
When completed, it will be 25 tiny homes,

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.240
each uniquely designed.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.960
- Seven houses are finished and occupied.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.640
Five houses are under construction.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.460
The first seven have just been wonderful.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.100
I feel like we hit the lottery.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.920
- [Voiceover] Many of the
materials are donated.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.620
And the construction involves
an army of volunteers.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.080
- [Faith] Some are schools,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.040
some are churches,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.540
some are corporate people,

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.080
and some are carpenters and electricians.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.820
It's been very humbling.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.040
- [Voiceover] Each home is
between 250 and 400 square feet,

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.380
and costs $1 per square foot.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.660
So a housing payment
comes out to be $250 to

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.820
$400 a month.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.900
How is this financially possible?

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.240
- We needed to eliminate the mortgage,

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.120
because our people
can't afford a mortgage.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.420
So we raised the money
for the homes up front.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.580
When they pay rent,
they're actually not paying

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.080
for rent to own.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.600
They're just paying rent
so that we establish

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.480
a financial history for them.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.280
We use that money to pay their taxes,

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.120
their water,

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.980
their insurance,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.320
and their security system.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.880
So if they pay that for seven years,

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.980
then we give them the house, the land,

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.840
the deed, and the bills.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.120
- [Voiceover] The mission
here is more than just

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.040
building shelter.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.340
It's about helping people
rebuild their lives.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.140
Keith McElveen was one
of the first residents

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.000
in the community.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.840
Born and raised in Detroit,

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.920
he's making the most of his second chance.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.440
- It was kinda hard growing up here.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.080
I grew up in the state system.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.980
It wasn't peaches and cream.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.900
- [Voiceover] After losing his job as an

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.600
assistant manager at a blood bank,

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.360
Keith couldn't find work.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.040
- I wound up selling drugs.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.140
And wound up going to prison.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.900
Seven years.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.920
It was kinda rough.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.640
But I endure.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.580
- When he came out, his mother, father,

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.240
sister and brother were all dead.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.060
So to go home, where do you go?

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.540
- Once I had got out,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.500
I was just trying to survive.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.900
And I didn't want to be homeless.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.000
I came to Cass looking for a job.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.500
- [Voiceover] Keith now
works security at Cass.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.980
But even when he's off the clock,

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.320
he's looking after the other residents

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.180
in the community.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.580
- I'm part of this community.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.000
I'm invested in a mission.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.020
- [Voiceover] The tiny homes community

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.460
is directly tied to Cass' social services,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.040
which provide programs for food,

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.880
healthcare,

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:45.780
and employment.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.020
The objective is to help
people improve their lives.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.220
And to help build a support network,

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.160
residents of the tiny community commit to

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.420
eight hours of volunteer
service every month.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.880
Like Gladys, who works
at the organization's

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.720
food pantry.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.820
- I love taking care of people.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.040
To me it's a community enrichment

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.660
because they help us, we help them.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.260
- [Voiceover] Participating
in Cass' services

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.200
helps build skills and community.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.800
- They then become the
role models for people

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.800
just coming in off the streets.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.400
What a wonderful thing.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.800
- [Voiceover] Since its launch,

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.160
the program has gained
wide-spread interest.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.200
Over 1,000 people have
inquired about applying

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.260
for tiny homes.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.980
And other places are seeing if the program

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.060
can be replicated.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.540
- [Faith] We're consulting
with other organizations

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.700
who are trying to do something
similar in their area.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.280
It is not the only solution.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.300
Not everybody wants to
live in a tiny home,

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.940
but it is certainly a great
option for people who are,

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.740
to help them up the ladder
of economic opportunity.
