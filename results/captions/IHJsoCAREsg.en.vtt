00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.900
While I was in Japan I got my hands on a Japanese
history textbook.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.700
But this isn't an ordinary Japanese textbook.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.160
It's a very political one, and if you look
inside you'll see a version of history that

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.880
is very different from the one the world knows.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.779
An example is the Nanking Massacre, the 1938
event in which Japanese troops murdered tens

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.869
of thousands of Chinese civilians.

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.110
To the world this this massacre is considered
one of the most infamous war crimes commited

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.940
by the Japanese during their takeover of Asia,
but in this textbook it basically gets no attention

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.730
It's referred to as the "Nanking Incident"
and the only attention it gets in this book

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.140
is basically disputing the facts.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.910
There's no mention of the hundreds of thousands
of Korean women who were forcibly brought

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.240
over to serve in brothels on the front lines
of the Japanese wars.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.540
They're these comfort women that are a huge
part of Japanese history,

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.560
but they don't show up in this book.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.320
When I was in Tokyo for a Borders story, I
actually visited the people who publish and

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.640
write this book.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.390
It's this group of old Japanese men who are
part of this lobbying society that basically

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.220
try to push a different historical narrative
into Japanese schools,

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.000
and they've been quite successful.

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:23.150
This textbook publishing society is one of
many expressions of a rising Nationalism in Japan

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.920
This is Makoto Sakurai.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.950
He's the public face for the Japan First Party.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.189
This group launched just a month after another
rightwing faction across the Pacific Ocean

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.969
took power of the White House, proclaiming
a like-minded message.

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:47.159
"America First! America First!"

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.799
Within the first five minutes of Sakurai,
and even through a translator, I could tell

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.260
that this guy would get along great with Donald
Trump.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.819
Sakurai's Japan First Party hasn't won any
elections yet, but other Nationalists in Japan

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.500
have, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
in 2012.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.820
He has surrounded himself with advisers and
ministers from some of these fringe groups,

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.180
who are now influencing policy.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.430
Up until now these guys, and yes most of them
are guys, have been known for driving around

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.080
in their decked out vans preaching the restoration
of Japan's pre-World War II greatness.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.610
Their agenda is similar to nationalist movements
in other countries: they want to restore strong

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.629
military, they call for the deportation of
Koreans and limitation to the little immigration

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.440
that Japan even has.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.060
I chased after these guys and filmed them
for an afternoon, watching them spar with

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.140
the Tokyo police.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.340
This yearning for a return to some ill-defined
golden age is the basis of many far right

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.440
Nationalist movements around  the globe

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.900
The main historical fixation of these Nationalists
is the 1860's, when Japan underwent a massive

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.530
transformation, giving the Emperor lots of
power which he used to rapidly educate the

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.709
people, grow the economy, and develop a massive
military.

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.420
Japan became an economic and military powerhouse
in just a few years and over the following

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.130
decades, they did what powerful countries
did back then: they started expanding, committing

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.410
horrific atrocities like mass genocide in
the process.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.220
By the mid-1900s, this aggressive expansion
brought Japan into a natural alignment with

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.750
Hitler's Germany, who was doing the same thing
in Europe.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.880
And then, at the height of the Japanese empire...

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.660
The bomb was exploded above the city and in
the towering mushroom, Japan could read its doom

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.530
The U.S. and Allied powers won the war.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.270
They came in, dismantled Japan's military,
and wrote them a new constitution that ensured

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.440
they'd never get so powerful again.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.919
To the Nationalists, this was the moment that
everything was lost.

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.210
Japan was brought to its knees, stripped of
the pride and national values thousands of

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.140
years in the making, emasculated by these
western powers who were now occupying their country

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.960
In Tokyo there's this huge controversial shrine
called Yasukuni.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.160
It's where all the people who died in the
wars under the emperor are memorialized, including

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.340
all those who died in World War II.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.210
After Japan lost the war, a huge trial was
held.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.940
Thousands were convicted of war crimes and
thrown into jail and even some were hanged.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.300
And what's tricky about this very beautiful
shrine that I'm walking through, is that over

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.210
a thousand of those war criminals are enshrined
here, and are prayed to every day.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.470
But a lot of Japanese people have a different
narrative about what happened after the war.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.699
According to this narrative, the tribunals
after World War II were not an impartial exercise

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:55.580
in justice, but rather an emotional backlash
against the atrocities that had just occurred

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.600
during the war.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.860
So, the fact that they're here in Yasukuni
doesn't bug a lot of these people.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.340
In fact, they revere them and they worship
them for their sacrifice to the emperor.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:11.030
All of the symbolism and the memorials point
to a glorification of the imperial period,

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.600
not necessarily an apology for it.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.600
The shrine is at the symbolic heart of the
Nationalist narrative, censoring any mention

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.510
of atrocities and glorifying the imperial
age as worthy of restoration.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.950
Upon leaving the shrine, I come across a rightwing
group that was visiting the shrine to pay

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.980
tribute to the spirits.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.380
So it's tempting to draw parallels with what's
happening in Japan with Nationalism and what

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:53.300
we see happening in the U.S. and Europe, with
figures like Donald Trump.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.610
But while that parallel works for a little
bit, it breaks down really quickly, and the

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.400
differentiating factor that is the most important
for understanding the difference is a word

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.980
that we've heard a lot lately.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.140
"Populism"

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:12.180
Many of these movements in the U.S. and in
Europe have been led by outsiders, populists

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.449
who want to dismantle the establishment.

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:17.800
in Japan that's not the case; people like
Shinzo Abe are

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.980
through and through establishment politicians.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.940
There isn't a disruptive figure who's coming
in from the outside and winning elections.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.449
While the rise of rightwing nationalism is
similar between Japan and the United States

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:34.090
and the West, it's still fundamentally quite
different and it appears that the rise of

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.860
a Japanese Donald Trump is still a ways off.
