00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:05.900
Welcome to the DietDoctor podcast
with Dr. Bret Scher.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.980
Today is my pleasure to be joined
by Dr. Robert Lustig.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.140
Dr. Lustig is a pediatric endocrinologist
recently retired from clinical practice at UCSF

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.699
but still very active in research

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.980
and now even having gone to get
a Masters of law from the Hastings College

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.019
so that he can get more involved
into the public policy side of things.

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.100
Because his whole life
he's been fighting childhood obesity

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.659
and he's been studying the CNS regulation
of energy balance.

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:39.460
But he knows it's more than science
that is affecting this

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.979
because this is blown up
in front of his eyes.

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:46.899
He has seen this epidemic of obesity and
diabetes take place as he's been practicing.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.060
And he's realized that it's going to take
more than science;

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.979
it's going to take public policy to halt this
and reverse it.

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:56.500
And that's what makes it
such an interesting discussion,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.100
he has such a great depth of knowledge
of the history of public policies,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.099
of analogous scenarios of public policy
and how we can use that information

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:10.340
to try and help us stem this this epidemic
that we're in the middle of

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.180
and what can we define
as the possible causes:

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.700
fructose, glucose, sucrose, sugar,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.540
all these terms get thrown around
as if they were one thing.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.939
We'll we talk a little bit about that
to identify the specifics of it

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.379
and also just the processed food
and how that plays into it as well,

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:31.500
the so-called healthy natural fruit juices.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.980
So I really enjoyed this discussion
with Robert

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.939
because he has such a great grasp
on both the science and the public policy

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.099
and how to help us draw a roadmap
on how to get out of this and reverse it.

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:47.780
So I really hope you'll enjoy this discussion

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.459
and in the end he'll list the different ways
to get in touch with him.

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.700
He's involved in for-profits and nonprofits,
he's written a number of books,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.540
so definitely stay tuned to the end so you
can learn all the things he's involved in

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.579
and if you want to hear more

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.219
because there's a lot more that
he has to say and has produced

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.500
that is very worthwhile
to read and listen to.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.092
So enjoy this interview
with Dr. Robert Lustig.

00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:18.618
Dr. Lustig thank you so much for joining me
on the DietDoctor podcast today.

00:02:18.714 --> 00:02:20.251
My pleasure,
but it's Rob to you.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.419
Rob, you got it, thank you.

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:27.340
Now in your career you have seen
this epidemic rise in front of your face

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.580
as a pediatric endocrinologist.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.699
I mean it's one thing,
I've said this before,

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:34.180
it's one thing for me to see diabetes
in adults

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.500
and the consequences that happen
in their 50s, 60s and 70s.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.259
But to see it in a pediatric population
with type 2 diabetes

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:44.379
and now nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.740
I mean this must be heartbreaking to see
in kids and you've seen it just exploding.

00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:53.259
Yeah, I mean I went into pediatrics
to stay away from chronic disease

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:55.699
and now that's all I do.

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:59.180
I went into pediatric endocrinology
to take care of short kids

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.340
and they got fat on me.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.620
They grew horizontally
rather than vertically.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.180
And that happened on my watch.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.860
And, you know, they're coming in

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.659
and for every patient I take care of,
10 more show up on the doorstep.

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.860
Something is wrong.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.180
And of course everybody knows
that something's wrong,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.500
but everyone seems to have
a different answer for what's wrong

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.497
and we can't tie it together.

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:28.539
And that's what has really halted
any progress.

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:33.060
All these different voices, different theories,
without a unifying approach

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.505
has just really made it
so we can't make any progress.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.500
Plus unfortunately some
of the stakeholders in this discussion

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.900
have money associated with it.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.699
So there are dark forces actually
trying to maintain the status quo.

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:49.820
Tell me some more about that.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.139
We can go on for hours

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.539
but the fact of the matter is that
the food industry has a vested interest

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:59.533
and have pulled out all the stops
in the same way that tobacco did.

00:03:59.534 --> 00:04:05.180
Marion Nestle just released this week
a book called &lt;i&gt;Unsavory Truth.&lt;/i&gt;

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.539
My colleagues, Aseem Malhotra
and Grant Schofield and I

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:12.819
published an article earlier this year
that the science against sugar alone

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.899
is not enough to win the battle
against obesity and type 2 diabetes.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:21.180
Opposition from vested interests
must be taken first.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.139
So we know who's on the other side.

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.620
And the problem is that the other side
has a very large mouthpiece

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.697
and a whole bunch of money.

00:04:30.793 --> 00:04:35.740
Right, a lot more money than scientists
and universities and physicians,

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.654
certainly as individuals and even trying
to group together can't come close.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.139
So we're doing our best.

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.579
The good news is we've got the science
and the science is very potent,

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:51.060
but, you know,
not everyone's a scientist.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.540
Sometimes not even scientists
are scientists.

00:04:53.609 --> 00:04:59.221
Your own record is basically saying that
fructose is probably the number one concern.

00:04:59.443 --> 00:05:04.396
I'm not going to say that,
I won't say it's the number one concern.

00:05:04.397 --> 00:05:08.060
Trans fats used to be
the number one concern.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.139
But we figured that out, it took 25 years
to figure it out and finally get rid of it.

00:05:13.359 --> 00:05:15.996
Which shows how slow
the needle moves on these.

00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:19.026
Well because there were dark forces
there as well.

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:28.939
Now I think that sugar is not the cause
of obesity, diabetes, fatty liver disease etc.

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:33.980
but it's the most malleable,
is the one that is the low hanging fruit,

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:40.579
it is the one that's added to other foods
specifically for the food industry's purposes,

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:47.540
therefore it is the easiest one
to attack and target upfront.

00:05:47.756 --> 00:05:50.740
Now do you think it's most important
to target sugar

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.710
or to differentiate it between fructose,
glucose, sucrose and sort of break it down?

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:59.420
To be honest with you,
they're the same thing.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.899
Once you understand what these different
chemicals do in the body

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:09.339
that is glucose and fructose,
they are not the same,

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:16.699
the food industry will tell you
11 ways from Sunday, a sugar is a sugar.

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:23.540
It is absolutely completely fallacious
and it's disingenuous to boot.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.339
They are not handled the same,
glucose and fructose.

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:33.180
As it turns out sucrose, high fructose
corn syrup, agave, maple syrup, honey,

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.459
are all basically equivalent,
they're all half glucose, half fructose.

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:43.180
Now glucose is the energy of life, every cell
on the planet burns glucose for energy.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.860
Glucose is so important that if you
don't consume it, your body makes it.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.420
And we know that because the Inuit
who ate whale blubber,

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:56.500
who didn't ever see a piece of bread
or grow a strand of wheat

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.019
still had a serum  glucose level.

00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:03.100
Vilhjalmur Stefansson and his assistant,
the famous Arctic explorer,

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.339
checked himself into Bellevue in 1928

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:11.180
and they ate nothing but meat for one year
on their clinical research Center.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.060
They still had a serum glucose level

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.339
and they were a hell of a lot healthier
than everybody else.

00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:16.587
Yeah.

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:20.939
So the notion that you need sugar to live

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:24.740
or that you even need glucose to live
is disingenuous.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.084
You need a blood glucose to live,
that is true,

00:07:27.085 --> 00:07:30.019
you don't need dietary glucose to live.

00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:33.420
Because it's so important
that your liver will make it.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.860
It will make it out of amino acids
or fatty acids as needed.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:44.019
So glucose is essential...
it is just not essential to eat.

00:07:44.019 --> 00:07:46.620
Fructose on the other hand...

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:52.459
there is no biochemical reaction
in any eukaryotic organism that requires it.

00:07:52.459 --> 00:07:57.180
It's completely vestigial
and when consumed in excess,

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.180
because of its unique metabolism

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:04.520
does three things that glucose does not do.

00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:08.300
One, it drives liver fat accumulation

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:12.060
faster than virtually any other item
on the planet.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:16.779
Number two, it engages in the Maillard
or the agent reaction.

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:20.620
Now glucose does it too,
but fructose does it seven times faster

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:26.860
and it turns out there is a metabolite
of fructose that does it 250 times faster

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.100
and we're working on that.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:34.700
And number three, fructose rather than glucose
stimulates the reward center of the brain

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.500
and therefore we have the data that shows

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.019
that the fructose molecule of sugar
is what it makes it addictive.

00:08:41.204 --> 00:08:45.100
So is it addictive?
Does it meet classification of addiction

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.059
and therefore should it be regulated
as an addictive component?

00:08:48.238 --> 00:08:53.179
So, first of all, addictive substances are
not regulated all by themselves,

00:08:53.179 --> 00:08:56.899
otherwise Starbucks would be
out of business.

00:08:56.899 --> 00:09:00.740
And if you take my Starbucks away from me
I will kill you, okay?

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.179
That's my addiction.

00:09:03.179 --> 00:09:07.172
I'm not proud of it, but at least
it's socially acceptable this week.

00:09:07.284 --> 00:09:08.697
How many have you had this morning?

00:09:08.795 --> 00:09:12.899
Three and I need my fourth.

00:09:12.899 --> 00:09:16.059
So the fact that is addictive
is not the reason for regulation.

00:09:16.059 --> 00:09:19.379
However when something is both toxic
and addictive

00:09:19.379 --> 00:09:23.059
and ubiquitous
and has detrimental effects on society

00:09:23.059 --> 00:09:26.659
then it meets the public health criteria
for regulation.

00:09:26.659 --> 00:09:29.460
In fact sugar does meet those criteria.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.500
So how is sugar addictive?

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:37.059
In 2012 sugar was not addictive.

00:09:37.059 --> 00:09:41.179
In 2013 sugar was addictive.

00:09:41.361 --> 00:09:43.379
What's the difference?
So what changed?

00:09:43.379 --> 00:09:47.139
Sugar changed?
No, the definition changed.

00:09:47.139 --> 00:09:51.419
The American Psychiatric Association,
they are the umpire,

00:09:51.419 --> 00:09:55.100
they call the balls and strikes
on things like addiction.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:01.740
And they had to add gambling
as an addiction.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:09.620
It became very clear that behavioral addictions
went through the same CNS process,

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.539
caused the same problems

00:10:12.539 --> 00:10:16.820
and had to be dealt with in the same ways
as chemical addictions.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:22.580
Now up till 2013 the DSM-4 said
you needed two things for addiction.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.500
You needed tolerance and withdrawal.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:32.139
Tolerance is the effect of these substances
on down regulation of dopamine receptors.

00:10:32.359 --> 00:10:33.989
That's why you need more and more
over time--

00:10:34.059 --> 00:10:38.820
More and more to get less and less,
that's this phenomenon called tolerance.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.419
Now the second criterion

00:10:42.419 --> 00:10:48.019
that the APA said
you had to have for addiction was withdrawal.

00:10:48.019 --> 00:10:53.539
Now turns out withdrawal, which is true
for all the chemical addictive substances,

00:10:53.539 --> 00:10:59.220
those are all effects that occur systemically
on the body, not on the brain.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:06.139
Caffeine withdrawal has effects on the heart,
on the vasculature, on sweat glands, etc.

00:11:06.139 --> 00:11:11.299
Opioids have effects on the G.I. tract,
have effects on the heart etc.

00:11:11.299 --> 00:11:17.460
They all have these effects that you can feel
and they cause withdrawal.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:21.179
Now gambling is not a chemical,

00:11:21.179 --> 00:11:26.980
gambling does not affect the body,
but it sure does affect the brain.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:32.779
And in order to be able to provide clinical
services under an addiction paradigm,

00:11:32.779 --> 00:11:36.779
the American Psychiatric Association
had to change the definition.

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:42.299
So when they broke out the DSM-5 in 2013,

00:11:42.299 --> 00:11:44.820
and they do this every 20 years,

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:48.220
now the definition could be
tolerance and withdrawal

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.726
or tolerance and dependence.

00:11:51.727 --> 00:11:55.379
There is nine criteria for dependence,
we don't have time for each one...

00:11:55.379 --> 00:11:58.059
You can look them up, they're online.

00:11:58.059 --> 00:12:01.899
And gambling meets all of them,
gaming disorder meets all of them,

00:12:01.899 --> 00:12:05.569
social media meets all of them,
shopping meets all of them,

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.940
pornography meets all of them and
guess what? Sugar meets all of them too.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:14.980
So we have substance addictions and
we also have behavioral addictions.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:21.379
And sugar happens to be a substance that
induces both tolerance and dependence.

00:12:21.379 --> 00:12:24.779
Anyone who says,
"Oh, I have a horrible sweet tooth"...

00:12:24.779 --> 00:12:26.577
They're sugar addict.

00:12:26.716 --> 00:12:31.299
But is knowing that enough to change
public policy or to change people?

00:12:31.299 --> 00:12:34.659
Certainly not enough to change
people's activities on their own

00:12:34.659 --> 00:12:36.580
and change their decisions.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.940
So what else has to be in place for us

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.100
to be able to say, "This is a public health
crisis that we need intervene upon?"

00:12:42.276 --> 00:12:45.059
We have two templates to look at.

00:12:45.059 --> 00:12:47.340
Tobacco and alcohol.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.740
So for years smoking was a liberty interest.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.580
You had a liberty interest to smoke.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:57.379
Boreali v. Axelrod, a famous New York State
Supreme Court case

00:12:57.379 --> 00:13:01.100
said you have a liberty interest to smoke
and you know what?

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.379
The New York state legislature
understanding what the problem was

00:13:04.379 --> 00:13:08.860
and understanding that
the tobacco industry was disingenuous

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:14.940
started passing laws that said you can't
smoke in bars, you can't smoke in atria,

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.379
you can't smoke in restaurants,
you can't smoke in schools,

00:13:18.379 --> 00:13:21.216
you can't smoke in hospitals

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:27.460
and now you can't even smoke in your car
if there's a kid in it.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:31.379
And the thing is
when it first started coming out

00:13:31.379 --> 00:13:33.379
people were yelling,
"Nanny state, nanny state".

00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:35.179
They're not doing that anymore.

00:13:35.359 --> 00:13:38.784
Part of that though is because of,
"I'm smoking here, I'm going to affect you".

00:13:38.899 --> 00:13:39.957
Exactly.

00:13:40.059 --> 00:13:42.579
I'm drinking my Coca-Cola here,
that's not going to affect you.

00:13:42.659 --> 00:13:44.779
-Oh, yes it is.
-How?

00:13:45.115 --> 00:13:46.740
Monetarily.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.940
Because if I have to go
to the emergency room

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:54.220
I won't be able to get in
because there will be gurneys filled

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:59.379
with people with sugar beverage
associated heart disease

00:13:59.379 --> 00:14:03.980
waiting for their coronary bypasses
or their TPA.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.580
And there won't be any money
in the system

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.460
for me to be able to access
that health care in the first place.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:14.899
Medicare will be broke by the year 2026,
Social Security will be broke by 2034

00:14:14.899 --> 00:14:17.700
because of this.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:22.019
So while it is not an assault on your person

00:14:22.019 --> 00:14:25.980
like tobacco is or like alcohol is
in terms of car accidents,

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:30.779
it is an assault on your person
in terms of your economy.

00:14:30.779 --> 00:14:34.460
Now you could argue
that's not the same

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.580
but the fact of the matter is
we still have to deal with it the same.

00:14:38.799 --> 00:14:41.620
Right, our society is not good
at seeing that next step.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.820
We're very good at seeing
the immediate--

00:14:44.001 --> 00:14:47.500
And the reason is
because we're all addicted.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:52.100
Addiction is about now
and happiness is about the future.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:57.340
It's about basically making life better
for later.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:02.179
We are into reward,
we are not into happiness,

00:15:02.179 --> 00:15:07.659
we are into instant gratification,
we are not into delayed gratification.

00:15:07.659 --> 00:15:11.139
Now, we doctors, know everything about
delayed gratification,

00:15:11.139 --> 00:15:14.299
because we went through med school,
residency, fellowship, etc.

00:15:14.299 --> 00:15:18.860
and we delayed, you know,
being able to see any money

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:24.820
or, you know, even patient care on our own
for 10, 15 sometimes even 20 years.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.899
We know everything there is to know
about delayed gratification.

00:15:27.899 --> 00:15:30.500
The fact of the matter is
the American public does not.

00:15:30.676 --> 00:15:33.659
And a lot of that has to do with industry

00:15:33.659 --> 00:15:37.580
and what has been put in front of us
in terms of choices we can make.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:42.419
And we are in an on-demand society,
we are in an instant gratification society

00:15:42.419 --> 00:15:44.940
and that's not something
that's going to be easy to fix.

00:15:45.193 --> 00:15:48.500
We are a dopamine society...
that is what it is.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.940
It is dopamine, call it what it is.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.580
So this is why I wrote this book,
&lt;i&gt;The Hacking of the American Mind&lt;/i&gt;;

00:15:55.580 --> 00:16:01.597
is to differentiate these two phenomena,
one called pleasure, one called happiness.

00:16:01.598 --> 00:16:06.940
Washington DC, Las Vegas,
Madison Avenue, Wall Street, Silicon Valley

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.779
have confused and conflated
these two terms on purpose.

00:16:11.779 --> 00:16:15.700
Because then they can "sell" you happiness.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.500
They can sell you pleasure,
no argument there,

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.860
they can sell your reward,
they can sell you immediate gratification,

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.539
I have no problem saying that.

00:16:24.539 --> 00:16:26.860
The question is,
"Are they selling you happiness"?

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:30.659
And the fact of the matter is
they're actually taking away your happiness.

00:16:30.659 --> 00:16:34.299
So what is the difference between these
two terms, pleasure and happiness?

00:16:34.299 --> 00:16:38.460
Number one, pleasure is short-lived,
happiness is long.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.740
Two, pleasure is visceral,
you feel it in your body,

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:46.059
like all of those substances
having those systemic effects.

00:16:46.059 --> 00:16:50.100
Happiness is ethereal,
you feel it above the neck.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.146
Pleasure is taking,
happiness is giving.

00:16:53.147 --> 00:16:55.340
Pleasure is experienced alone,

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.899
happiness is usually experienced
in social groups.

00:16:57.899 --> 00:16:59.940
Pleasure can be achieved
with substances,

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.779
happiness cannot be achieved
with substances.

00:17:02.779 --> 00:17:06.259
The extremes of pleasure
whether they'd be substances or behaviors...

00:17:06.259 --> 00:17:14.051
So substances like cocaine, alcohol,
nicotine, opioids, heroin, sugar

00:17:14.052 --> 00:17:19.819
or behaviors - shopping, gambling,
Internet, social media, porn.

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:23.099
In the extreme all lead to addiction.

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:26.700
There's an "-aholic"
next to every one of those.

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:31.019
Shopaholic, sexaholic, alcoholic, chocoholic
you know, down the list.

00:17:31.201 --> 00:17:33.081
There's no "happyaholic".

00:17:33.161 --> 00:17:34.859
There's no "happyaholic".

00:17:34.859 --> 00:17:38.099
You can't be overdosed
on too much happiness, don't exist.

00:17:38.099 --> 00:17:43.539
And then finally number seven,
pleasure's dopamine happiness is serotonin.

00:17:43.539 --> 00:17:48.140
Now why do we care?
What does it matter? Here's why.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:52.299
Dopamine is an excitatory
neurotransmitter.

00:17:52.299 --> 00:17:55.906
Every time dopamine is released,
it crosses the synapse,

00:17:55.907 --> 00:18:01.819
binds to its receptors on the next neuron,
the neuron fires, it excites the next neuron.

00:18:01.819 --> 00:18:05.339
Now neurons like to be excited,
that's why they have receptors.

00:18:05.339 --> 00:18:07.940
But they like to be tickled,
not bludgeoned.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:11.819
Chronic overstimulation of any neuron
anywhere in the body

00:18:11.819 --> 00:18:14.500
will lead to neuronal cell death.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.815
And we know this because kids who have
chronic long-term seizure disorders

00:18:17.816 --> 00:18:19.703
and status epilepticus

00:18:19.704 --> 00:18:22.460
have to be rushed to the ICU
and we have to stop their seizures.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:25.539
Because the longer the seizures go on,
the more brain damage occurs.

00:18:25.539 --> 00:18:27.779
So we notice.

00:18:27.779 --> 00:18:33.660
That second neuron that's receiving
the dopamine signal,

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:37.539
it doesn't want to die,
it wants to protect itself.

00:18:37.539 --> 00:18:40.299
So it has a failsafe, it has a plan B.

00:18:40.299 --> 00:18:44.539
What it does is it down regulates
the number of receptors

00:18:44.539 --> 00:18:49.500
so that there is less chance, statistically,
through the law of mass action

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:54.561
that any given molecule of dopamine
will find a receptor.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.863
It makes sense.

00:18:55.981 --> 00:18:59.019
Thereby reducing the game.

00:18:59.019 --> 00:19:01.500
So what does this mean in human terms?

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.940
You get a hit, you get a rush,
receptors go down.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:09.099
Next time you need a bigger hit
to get the same rush, receptors go down,

00:19:09.099 --> 00:19:10.980
then a bigger hit, bigger hit.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.420
Until finally you need a huge hit
to get nothing.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.380
That's called tolerance.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.740
And then when the neurons
actually do start to die,

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.689
that's called addiction.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:23.019
And guess what? When those neurons die,
they ain't coming back.

00:19:23.019 --> 00:19:25.619
Which is why addiction is so hard to treat.

00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:27.500
And now when we talk about sugar,

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.900
you mentioned that fructose specifically
has this addictive property

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.465
more so than glucose itself.

00:19:34.561 --> 00:19:38.140
So fructose when you do
the fMRI studies

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:41.366
and one of those studies was done
by your previous guest, David Ludwig,

00:19:41.367 --> 00:19:43.500
and Cara Ebbeling,

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.900
specifically stimulates the reward center,
the nucleus accumbens,

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.980
that part of the limbic system,
and it turns out that glucose does not.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.859
Now glucose is a little sweet.

00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:57.539
Glucose has a sweetness index of 74

00:19:57.539 --> 00:20:02.500
compared to sucrose of 100
or fructose of 173.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:08.059
Glucose activates the cortex,
the basal ganglia, certain other parts,

00:20:08.059 --> 00:20:10.339
but not the limbic system.

00:20:10.339 --> 00:20:13.099
Fructose stimulates the limbic system

00:20:13.099 --> 00:20:16.900
so they act at two completely
different places in the brain.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:21.859
And anything, anything that acts
at the nucleus accumbens

00:20:21.859 --> 00:20:24.579
leads to dopamine release

00:20:24.579 --> 00:20:30.499
and anything that does has,
in its extreme, addiction.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:35.500
Pick your substance, pick your behavior.
Fructose does it too.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:41.380
And we have the empiric data
to show that this occurs in humans.

00:20:41.681 --> 00:20:46.059
Now, is there a threshold level though
because fruit has fructose in it?

00:20:46.059 --> 00:20:49.859
You know if you eat an apple
you're not stimulating the reward system.

00:20:49.859 --> 00:20:53.334
So, that comes into absorption,
it comes into fiber,

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:55.539
but also  even if you're getting
straight fructose,

00:20:55.539 --> 00:20:59.644
is there still some threshold level
below which you're okay?

00:20:59.799 --> 00:21:03.140
Almost assuredly yes, and probably
depends on who you are,

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.579
probably depends
on your hepatic metabolism,

00:21:05.579 --> 00:21:09.059
probably depends on various phenomena
that are going on,

00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:12.299
probably depends on how insulin resistant
you are as well.

00:21:12.299 --> 00:21:14.660
For instance, let me give you an example;

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:21.180
Latinos have a very specific
two sets of polymorphisms, not 1, 2

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:26.900
in their liver fat transcription machinery,
in their liver.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:32.779
First one is called PNPLA3
Patatin-like Phospholipase Protein domain A3,

00:21:32.779 --> 00:21:35.859
and the other one is called SLC16A11,

00:21:35.859 --> 00:21:40.940
both of these are involved in how the liver
turns sugar into fat.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:45.180
And, if you have the bad genotype
for each of these

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:49.579
and Latinos for whatever reason
seemed to have

00:21:49.579 --> 00:21:57.059
the more frequency of those problem
alleles in the Latino population.

00:21:57.059 --> 00:22:01.980
If you have those, a little sugar
makes a lot of liver fat,

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:07.420
and if that's the case then the more
sugar you eat, the sicker you get,

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.772
the quicker you get if you understand.

00:22:09.844 --> 00:22:10.723
Sure.

00:22:10.801 --> 00:22:17.019
Another thing that we know there is 
an allele in the brain, called type 1A allele.

00:22:17.019 --> 00:22:20.059
And if you have this allelic variation

00:22:20.059 --> 00:22:24.420
you make 30% fewer dopamine receptors
to start.

00:22:24.604 --> 00:22:25.765
Oh interesting.

00:22:25.859 --> 00:22:30.059
In which case that means you need
more substrate more dopamine

00:22:30.059 --> 00:22:33.579
in order to occupy fewer receptors
at baseline.

00:22:33.579 --> 00:22:36.099
Which means you got to eat
a whole a lot more sugar

00:22:36.099 --> 00:22:39.940
to get any sort of pleasure out of it.

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.299
And those people have been shown
to increase their rate of weight gain

00:22:43.299 --> 00:22:47.660
and increase their insulin resistance
faster than even the general population.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:53.339
So without doubt there are probably
predisposing factors

00:22:53.339 --> 00:22:56.259
that some of them being genetic,
some being epigenetic,

00:22:56.259 --> 00:22:58.660
some being very specifically
environmental.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:03.259
Also depends on how much sugar and how
much bad food is around you.

00:23:03.259 --> 00:23:07.220
You know you have food desserts
in lower SCS neighborhoods,

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.460
and clearly they are the most susceptible

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:14.220
and they're also the ones
driving health care through the roof.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.500
So, you know we've got a problem.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.779
You've got to deal with the environment.

00:23:19.779 --> 00:23:24.420
So this isn't just genetic,
although genetics play a role,

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:27.420
and we can't fix genetics anyway.

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:31.059
So you know let's fix what we can.
Let's fix the environment.

00:23:31.236 --> 00:23:34.619
Yes, there's clearly the volume
that people are ingesting,

00:23:34.619 --> 00:23:38.763
it wouldn't matter what your genetics are,
still causing significant disease.

00:23:38.841 --> 00:23:42.900
The data from the American Heart Association,
and I signed on to this statement,

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.299
said that the adult women
should be consuming

00:23:46.299 --> 00:23:50.019
no more than 60 spoons of added sugar
per day, that's 25 grams,

00:23:50.019 --> 00:23:54.019
and adult men 9 teaspoons,
that's 37 and a half grams.

00:23:54.020 --> 00:24:00.579
The median for the United States today
is 94 grams.

00:24:00.579 --> 00:24:06.983
So even if we cut our consumption
by two thirds we would still be over our limit.

00:24:07.059 --> 00:24:10.499
Wow, and for reference
how much is in one can of coke?

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.684
39.

00:24:11.779 --> 00:24:13.488
39, so that's....

00:24:13.579 --> 00:24:15.308
-You're over.
-You're over.

00:24:15.396 --> 00:24:17.819
One can of coke you're over.
You're done.

00:24:17.913 --> 00:24:21.539
Yes, and also the size of the cans of coke
have changed dramatically.

00:24:21.539 --> 00:24:25.420
So that goes into the volume
and the threshold effect as well?

00:24:25.553 --> 00:24:27.740
Well so now we have
the 20 ounce bottle.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.140
Actually because of this problem

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:34.859
in an attempt to try to, you know, have
a marketing ploy

00:24:34.859 --> 00:24:38.059
Coke as you know has come out
with its 8 ounce can.

00:24:38.059 --> 00:24:40.180
You know have a little coke.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:45.339
You know, they actually use Antman
to pedal little coke.

00:24:45.339 --> 00:24:50.940
You know, look... anything that reduces
consumption is good.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:54.339
The question is how do you do that
on mass?

00:24:54.339 --> 00:24:56.740
How do you that for everyone?

00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:00.980
Ultimately the only way
is to decrease availability.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:04.380
This is the iron law of public health.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:09.900
You decrease availability which decreases
consumption, which decreases health harms.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:14.779
The Iron Law of public health,
true for tobacco, true for alcohol,

00:25:14.779 --> 00:25:16.500
decrease availability.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.660
Now you don't want to ban it.
You know, banning doesn't work.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.777
We tried that with alcohol and you saw
what happened.

00:25:21.778 --> 00:25:24.859
That was called the 18th amendment
and the 21st amendment.

00:25:24.859 --> 00:25:26.500
We're not doing that again.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.819
What you have to do
is you have to make it hurt.

00:25:29.819 --> 00:25:34.579
You make it available you make it hurt.
You make it harder to get effectively.

00:25:34.579 --> 00:25:37.259
So that's this notion of soda taxes.

00:25:37.259 --> 00:25:39.700
I'll be very honest with you.

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:43.299
I am for reduction and consumption
however it can be done.

00:25:43.299 --> 00:25:50.740
I think there's a way better, easier,
much more effective way

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:57.059
of dealing with this issue 
of effective availability.

00:25:57.059 --> 00:25:59.539
Get rid of the subsidies.

00:25:59.756 --> 00:26:05.579
So going back to Nixon era
and with his secretary Butz

00:26:05.579 --> 00:26:10.980
and how they sort of started this whole
process to try and increase productivity

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.420
and decrease cost,
which maybe at that time made sense,

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:18.539
but now in a whole different environment
we're stuck with the same subsidies

00:26:18.539 --> 00:26:22.140
with a completely different connotation
of what it means for our society.

00:26:22.399 --> 00:26:24.539
-It didn't even make sense for Nixon.
-It didn't.

00:26:24.619 --> 00:26:26.859
It made sense for Roosevelt.

00:26:26.859 --> 00:26:32.140
So for Franklin, it made sense because
we had 2 things going on at the same time.

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:36.180
We had the Depression
and the Dust Bowl in 1933.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:41.220
So we had a destitute population
in the American southwest.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.779
They were dying of famine.

00:26:43.779 --> 00:26:47.900
And the problem was all the food and all
the food companies were in the Northeast.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:53.380
So if you just dump the food in a railroad
car and sent it to the southwest,

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.531
by the time it got there,
it would be rancid.

00:26:55.532 --> 00:26:57.539
So they had to process it.

00:26:57.539 --> 00:27:02.099
They had to basically take the wheat,
and process it, get rid of the fiber,

00:27:02.099 --> 00:27:05.779
put in a 5 pound bags
and then bake it up locally.

00:27:05.779 --> 00:27:09.574
And subsidize it

00:27:09.574 --> 00:27:15.899
to make it worth the while
of the American food industry to do so.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:20.700
And in 1933 that made sense, and even
made sense through World War 2

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.299
but after that it stopped making sense,

00:27:23.299 --> 00:27:26.460
but people realized,
"Hey I can make money with this".

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:30.259
So we doubled down,
and then Nixon came along

00:27:30.259 --> 00:27:33.900
and he had to deal with political unrest,
a lot of it.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:40.140
And he knew that fluctuating food prices
caused political unrest.

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:47.420
And so he told his agriculture secretarial
Rusty Butz, to make food cheap.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:53.483
Whatever it took, to make food cheap,
and so Butz said 3 things,

00:27:53.484 --> 00:27:57.782
row to row, furrow to furrow,
get big or get out.

00:27:57.782 --> 00:27:59.618
That's what he said.

00:27:59.619 --> 00:28:04.180
Up to that point we had paid the farmers
not to grow certain crops

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:08.619
to artificially inflate prices,
to benefit the farmer.

00:28:08.619 --> 00:28:12.140
That went by the boards.
That was the end of that.

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:15.619
What he now said was "We're going
to make it up in volume,

00:28:15.619 --> 00:28:21.539
and we're going to subsidize those foods
in order to make them cheap".

00:28:21.539 --> 00:28:25.700
And we did, but that also led
to monoculture.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:31.500
So all the corn is now in Iowa
and all the cattle are now in Kansas,

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.339
and so because there's no manure in Iowa

00:28:34.339 --> 00:28:38.099
you got to spray them with petroleum
products which poisoned the water,

00:28:38.099 --> 00:28:45.940
and because there's no grain
or grass in Kansas,

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:49.140
they're all on feedlots,
you have to give them antibiotics

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:53.180
which is changing our microbiome
to make things even worse.

00:28:53.180 --> 00:29:00.619
In other words we dissembled
a food paradigm that actually worked.

00:29:00.619 --> 00:29:04.819
For one that was cheaper
but way more dangerous,

00:29:04.819 --> 00:29:10.038
and we have to un-dissemble that
and the only way to do that is with policy.

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:14.859
Right and so many livelihoods
depend on these subsidies now,

00:29:14.859 --> 00:29:17.900
and so much of our economy
depends on these subsidies

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:21.019
and it seems it's too big of a problem
to tackle

00:29:21.019 --> 00:29:24.059
but if we think that way
then this will just keep perpetuating.

00:29:24.059 --> 00:29:28.140
So we have to find a way to make
the right foods less expensive,

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:31.380
instead of the wrong food
so to speak less expensive

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.619
and to get rid
of this mono cropping culture

00:29:34.619 --> 00:29:37.980
to get back to grasslands
and rotational grazing,

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.700
because we're destroying our environment
at the same time.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:45.539
And I guess that's part of what's spurred you
to go get your masters in law,

00:29:45.539 --> 00:29:49.259
and start getting into the policy side of
things and the advocacy side of things.

00:29:49.599 --> 00:29:51.539
Right, I had 2 questions.

00:29:51.539 --> 00:29:56.339
I went to UC Hastings College of Law
for a masters in law.

00:29:56.339 --> 00:30:00.259
I wasn't trying to get a JD,
and I don't want to be a lawyer

00:30:00.259 --> 00:30:02.660
but I want to be able to talk to them.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.500
So I had to learn their vocabulary.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:08.099
And I had
2 questions when I entered in 2012.

00:30:08.099 --> 00:30:12.019
When does a personal health issue
become a public health crisis,

00:30:12.019 --> 00:30:15.980
and what are the legal doctrines
that either support or refute that?

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.140
Especially, at the supreme court.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:22.539
And number two - How did tobacco
get away with it for 40 years?

00:30:22.539 --> 00:30:24.460
What was their playbook?

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:27.460
Because ultimately the food industry
is using the same playbook.

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:31.299
So if we study tobacco we can actually figure
what we ought to be doing here,

00:30:31.299 --> 00:30:35.019
and in fact we're doing it.

00:30:35.019 --> 00:30:40.380
I'm very pleased and proud of how things
have gone and there have been movements.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:44.019
And, you can see the movements,
it takes a while.

00:30:44.019 --> 00:30:47.289
You know, cultural tectonic shifts
do not happen overnight.

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.140
I'll give you an example:

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:55.619
There have been 4 cultural tectonic shifts
in the United States in the last 30 years.

00:30:55.619 --> 00:31:00.420
I'll name them: Bicycle helmets and seatbelts,
smoking in public places,

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:04.043
drunk driving,
and condoms in bathrooms.

00:31:04.044 --> 00:31:08.460
30 years ago, if a legislator had stood up
in a statehouse or in congress

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:13.740
to propose any of those,
would've been laughed right out of town.

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:19.579
All those were anathema... "Nanny State",
every single one of them; nanny state.

00:31:19.579 --> 00:31:23.900
Today they're all facts of life.
We accept all of them.

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:26.299
In fact, it's click it or tick it

00:31:26.299 --> 00:31:33.019
and God forbid, you see a kid riding his bike
without a helmet you call the cops.

00:31:33.019 --> 00:31:35.660
That's what you should be calling cops for.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.940
Not you know, "gardening while black".

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:43.254
Call the cops for the kid
who's riding without a helmet.

00:31:43.255 --> 00:31:50.460
The point is every single one of these
required public education first,

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.259
and then that softened
the playing field

00:31:53.259 --> 00:31:58.140
and allowed for changes
in legislation and litigation.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:01.019
This is going on now with food.

00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:06.059
And we're probably out of the 30 years,
we're probably about 7 years.

00:32:06.059 --> 00:32:08.220
You know, but it's going to take a while,

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:12.779
it's still going to take a good 20 years
before we're going to see the real change.

00:32:12.779 --> 00:32:16.050
And I'll tell you, you know what it takes?
It takes a generation.

00:32:16.051 --> 00:32:17.995
And you know why it takes a generation?

00:32:18.099 --> 00:32:20.146
People need to die, unfortunately.

00:32:20.226 --> 00:32:22.259
That's part A.

00:32:22.259 --> 00:32:25.579
The old people who won't accept
need to die,

00:32:25.579 --> 00:32:34.003
and B, you have to teach the children
because then when they get over 18 they vote.

00:32:34.112 --> 00:32:36.220
-That's what happens.
-Right.

00:32:36.315 --> 00:32:38.026
So we're doing it.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.900
Yes, one of the interesting questions to
say,

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.980
as that's happenings
where are the lines being drawn?

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.220
Because I've used Coca Cola as an example,
they're an easy example,

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:51.660
but what about the fresh squeezed
orange juice and the all-natural fruit juice

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:54.740
and you know are those
going to be protected

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.940
more than some
of the other sugary beverages?

00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.019
Yet they can all cause the same problem.

00:33:00.019 --> 00:33:03.460
So part of it is, where are we going
to draw the line?

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:08.339
And someone say we have to go after meat,
because poor epidemiological studies say meat,

00:33:08.339 --> 00:33:11.753
so, we need science
to inform those decisions.

00:33:11.833 --> 00:33:16.180
Indeed. I couldn't agree more.
We need science to inform those decisions.

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:22.646
The citrus growers are ballistic.
They're absolutely ballistic.

00:33:22.647 --> 00:33:28.140
You know, they're saying,
"We didn't add any sugar to our orange juice".

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:30.900
That's true, they didn't.
What they do is they took out the fiber.

00:33:30.901 --> 00:33:34.700
Now, when you take the fiber
out of the fruit

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:38.740
basically what your left is with, is a soda.

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:43.180
Here's why, the fiber in the fruit
and there're two kinds,

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.500
they're soluble and insoluble.

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:51.220
So soluble like pectin or inulin,
would hold jelly together,

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:56.460
insoluble fiber like cellulose,
the stringy stuff in celery.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.980
So fruit has both.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:01.740
Now when you consume the whole fruit,

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:05.700
you're consuming both fibers,
soluble and insoluble, and they work together.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:10.420
What they do is they form a gel
on the inside of your duodenum.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:14.659
After they pass the stomach they set up
the latticework of the cellulose.

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:17.215
Coats the inside of the intestine

00:34:17.216 --> 00:34:20.500
and then
the soluble fiber which are globular

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:23.019
plug the holes in that latticework.

00:34:23.019 --> 00:34:26.820
And you end up
a secondary impenetrable barrier

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:33.019
which limits the rate and the amount
of monosaccharides

00:34:33.019 --> 00:34:38.820
that are absorbed from the duodenum
into the portal vein which go to the liver.

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:42.179
So what you're doing
is you're saving your liver.

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:46.059
You're preventing from having to deal
with the onslaught,

00:34:46.059 --> 00:34:52.099
the tsunami of monosaccharides
that come with an orange juice

00:34:52.099 --> 00:34:54.500
when you eat an orange.

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:56.980
So the orange is okay.

00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:02.219
What happens if you reduce the rate of
absorption of monosaccharides in the duodenum?

00:35:02.219 --> 00:35:06.219
Where do they go? Well, they keep going,
they go to the jejunum.

00:35:06.219 --> 00:35:10.219
What's in the jejunum
that's not in the duodenum?

00:35:10.219 --> 00:35:12.380
The microbiome.

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.980
So the duodenum has a pH of 1

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:18.059
because hydrochloric acid
from the stomach,

00:35:18.059 --> 00:35:22.940
the pancreatic juice is secreted 
through the sphincter of Oddi,

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.619
which is in the middle duodenum,

00:35:25.619 --> 00:35:28.179
and then it mixes with the chime

00:35:28.179 --> 00:35:31.260
and so then by the time
you hit the ligament of Treitz

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:36.380
which is where the jejunum starts,
the pH has gone from 1 to 7.4.

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:40.659
The bacteria can't live at pH 1, only they
will go back to pyloric and live there,

00:35:40.659 --> 00:35:43.539
but at 7.4 they can all live.

00:35:43.539 --> 00:35:46.500
Well they got to eat something, you know?

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:50.179
You got 10 trillion cells in your body,

00:35:50.179 --> 00:35:52.780
you got a hundred trillion bacteria
in your intestine,

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.059
they outnumber you 10 to 1.

00:35:55.059 --> 00:35:57.699
Each of us is just a big bag of bacteria
with legs.

00:35:57.699 --> 00:35:59.781
They got to eat something.

00:35:59.782 --> 00:36:01.900
Question is what do they eat?
Will they what you eat?

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.780
The questions, how much did you get
versus how much did they get?

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:08.980
If you ate the fruit, if you ate the orange,
what you're doing is,

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:11.860
you're feeding your bacteria.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:16.340
So even though you consumed it
you never got it. The bacteria got it.

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:21.619
Now, all of these energy balance studies,
all of these room calorimeter studies,

00:36:21.619 --> 00:36:24.420
all of these Kevin Hall studies,

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:31.139
that will be lambasted in about
a few minutes downstairs at this meeting.

00:36:31.139 --> 00:36:35.019
They are all measuring a unit.

00:36:35.019 --> 00:36:39.619
It is the human bacterial unit.

00:36:39.619 --> 00:36:42.286
It is not the human.

00:36:42.287 --> 00:36:46.099
You cannot tell the carbon dioxide,

00:36:46.099 --> 00:36:53.292
if it came from cellular metabolism
of humans or cellular metabolism of bacteria.

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:54.522
Interesting.

00:36:54.619 --> 00:36:57.420
You cannot separate out those two.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:04.699
So it really doesn't matter because if you
feed your bacteria then they get healthy,

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:08.300
and you get what's known
as microbial diversity.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:14.579
You get fewer cytokines, and you get
short-chain fatty acids from the soluble fiber

00:37:14.579 --> 00:37:17.579
as it's fermented further down the colon.

00:37:17.579 --> 00:37:23.059
So fiber basically means
that you're feeding your bacteria.

00:37:23.059 --> 00:37:31.128
So when you consume an orange,
that fructose wasn't for you.

00:37:31.129 --> 00:37:33.260
It was for your bacteria.

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:35.820
So I'm not really concerned about fruit.

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:41.403
I am concerned about fruit juice because
the insoluble fiber has been removed.

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.980
So the science would say it's the same

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:46.860
yet the public opinion seems to be
markedly different.

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:51.019
So is that going to make it a bigger hill
to climb to fight that,

00:37:51.019 --> 00:37:53.619
and it would in added sugary beverage?

00:37:53.699 --> 00:37:56.739
Yes, and it has been
and will continue to be,

00:37:56.739 --> 00:38:02.179
and in part because the food industry
points to that as the excuse.

00:38:02.179 --> 00:38:06.300
That's their method for swaging
their culpability. This orange juice.

00:38:06.555 --> 00:38:07.598
Right.

00:38:07.699 --> 00:38:09.619
Okay? Orange juice is healthy.

00:38:09.619 --> 00:38:13.900
Anita Bryant said, "A day without orange
juice is like a day without sunshine."

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:19.619
You know take a frigging pill.
This is the problem.

00:38:19.619 --> 00:38:24.699
But it's the science that ultimately
has to win out. But it takes a while.

00:38:24.699 --> 00:38:27.619
You know, when we're talking
about educating the public,

00:38:27.619 --> 00:38:30.619
particularly a public that has been,

00:38:30.619 --> 00:38:35.619
shall we say divorced from science
for a long time

00:38:35.619 --> 00:38:40.900
and not taught science in schools,
and not taught a scientific method,

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:45.739
and not taught the scientific rational
and scientific thinking.

00:38:45.739 --> 00:38:49.156
You know, this is a very heavy lift.

00:38:49.239 --> 00:38:52.940
You can state all those
as they apply to the public.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.300
You could probably state all those

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.460
as they apply to physicians
and some scientists as well.

00:38:57.689 --> 00:38:59.167
No argument.

00:38:59.282 --> 00:39:02.539
And you can have documentaries
that have been produced recently

00:39:02.539 --> 00:39:06.019
where a physician wearing a lab coat
was staring to the camera

00:39:06.019 --> 00:39:09.007
and say, "Sugar does not cause diabetes."

00:39:09.119 --> 00:39:15.539
Yes, Dr. Neal Barnard,
I want to have a duel with you.

00:39:15.539 --> 00:39:18.380
I am calling you out.

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:22.099
I will meet you anywhere you say.

00:39:22.099 --> 00:39:26.619
We will leave our guns at home
we will be armed only with the science

00:39:26.619 --> 00:39:30.460
and I am going to take you down.

00:39:30.561 --> 00:39:33.619
I was trying to be clandestine
and not come out with names,

00:39:33.619 --> 00:39:35.846
but apparently that's not going to fly here.

00:39:35.921 --> 00:39:40.366
No it's not.
I think he has poisoned America.

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.319
And that's part of the problem.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.219
I mean he's got a name,
he's respected in many circles

00:39:45.219 --> 00:39:49.380
and they hear him make a comment like that
is just so confusing for the American public.

00:39:49.477 --> 00:39:50.579
Indeed.

00:39:50.667 --> 00:39:53.179
And so we have to fight 
amongst ourselves

00:39:53.179 --> 00:39:57.575
in addition to fighting external influences
and industry and that just makes it a--

00:39:57.637 --> 00:39:59.699
Makes it even that much harder, exactly.

00:39:59.699 --> 00:40:03.179
And so part of my job,
if you will,

00:40:03.179 --> 00:40:10.099
is to ally the medical, the dental and dietary
professions to speak with one voice.

00:40:10.099 --> 00:40:13.460
The food industry loves
that we fight with each other.

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:15.539
It's how they win.

00:40:15.539 --> 00:40:20.139
If we actually were united and we can be
united--

00:40:20.139 --> 00:40:22.739
So this is Low-Carb USA.

00:40:22.739 --> 00:40:26.780
I'll be very honest with you,
I have nothing against low-carb,

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.780
I also have nothing against vegan.

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:31.420
I really don't.

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.340
I don't have anything
against either of them.

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:36.019
The only thing I have something against
is the dogma.

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.820
That I have, a lot of against.

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:43.260
You know, Ornish has good data that works,

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:48.019
and I believe it works and the data
show that it works, and you know what?

00:40:48.019 --> 00:40:52.531
So does low-carb, so does keto,
and so does Atkins when you do it right.

00:40:52.532 --> 00:40:55.739
And the point is there are
a lot of diets that work.

00:40:55.739 --> 00:40:58.489
Mediterranean works, you know.

00:40:58.561 --> 00:41:02.300
Right, in what lifestyle what context?

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:05.857
Because Ornish's studies was
in a comprehensive lifestyle program.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:06.784
Totally.

00:41:06.843 --> 00:41:11.283
Mediterranean diet studies where
in a certain lifestyle of  Mediterranean.

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:15.099
Where they can do it.
I totally agree.

00:41:15.099 --> 00:41:19.940
The point is that every single diet
that works, and I don't care where you go.

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:23.539
I don't care if you go to Greenland
and do whale blubber.

00:41:23.539 --> 00:41:28.659
I don't care of you go to Africa
and do the Masai,

00:41:28.659 --> 00:41:32.900
I don't care if you're talking
about agrarian cultures.

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:36.219
I just don't care.
It's irrelevant.

00:41:36.219 --> 00:41:42.659
The point is every diet that works
on the planet is low sugar high fiber.

00:41:42.659 --> 00:41:49.699
Low sugar so your liver doesn't get sick,
high fiber so you feed your bacteria.

00:41:49.699 --> 00:41:54.380
Processed food is
high sugar low fiber.

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:58.059
High sugar for palatability
and low fiber for shelf life.

00:41:58.059 --> 00:42:03.149
Makes the food cheap
but turned it into consumable poison.

00:42:03.229 --> 00:42:07.940
So there's a rising tide
of a low sugar low fiber diet,

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:14.851
the all meat carnivore which is working
very well for a number of people

00:42:14.852 --> 00:42:17.512
in a number of anecdotal reports.

00:42:17.579 --> 00:42:22.765
It will improve insulin sensitivity.
It will decrease insulin secretion.

00:42:23.723 --> 00:42:29.099
I used low carb diets in my clinic for patients
who had massive insulin resistance,

00:42:29.099 --> 00:42:31.420
who could not be treated any other way.

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:34.340
I know it works.
That's why I am for it.

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:37.019
I didn't say I was against it. I'm for it.

00:42:37.019 --> 00:42:39.780
But I'm for the other too.
And you know what?

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:46.619
People who have familial hypercholesterolemia
have to eat the other way.

00:42:46.619 --> 00:42:49.059
That depends on who you are,
it depends on your gene type,

00:42:49.059 --> 00:42:52.699
depends on your disease burden,
depends on your family history,

00:42:52.699 --> 00:42:57.099
depends on your environment,
depends on a lot of things.

00:42:57.099 --> 00:43:02.420
The point is there's no cookie cutter answer.
There is now one diet.

00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:07.820
And the goal is to bring the right diet
to the right person at the right time.

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:12.059
But you can't do that
if you're all in one diet

00:43:12.059 --> 00:43:19.139
and in my clinic we parsed people
instead of lumped them.

00:43:19.236 --> 00:43:22.579
That's a great point and even in a condition
like familial hypercholesterolemia

00:43:22.579 --> 00:43:26.179
you can't necessarily lump them
into one category,

00:43:26.179 --> 00:43:30.579
because you get someone who's got FH
and he's insulin resistant, pre diabetic,

00:43:30.579 --> 00:43:32.380
and high inflammatory markers,

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:35.380
and now you're really stewing the pot
for a bad outcome.

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:38.619
You have to address that possibly
into a low-carb situation as well.

00:43:38.761 --> 00:43:41.019
Point is target the pathology.

00:43:41.019 --> 00:43:46.260
Always that's a physician's mantra,
target the pathology.

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:51.051
If you don't know what the pathology is
then what do you target?

00:43:51.139 --> 00:43:54.139
Right, and that comes back to your talks
about metabolic syndrome,

00:43:54.139 --> 00:43:57.340
what you're talking about 
here at this conference.

00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:00.619
You know we define, we have our definition
of the metabolic syndrome

00:44:00.619 --> 00:44:02.619
about the waist circumference
and hypertension.

00:44:02.739 --> 00:44:04.523
CARBage.

00:44:04.616 --> 00:44:10.563
And you said, alright.
So tell me about that.

00:44:10.683 --> 00:44:15.420
They are all manifestations
of the metabolic dysfunction.

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:19.940
They're all markers for metabolic dysfunction,
they're not the causes.

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.300
Yes they cluster together,
no argument there.

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:25.659
Different people have different ones,

00:44:25.659 --> 00:44:29.882
different races have different predilections
to different diseases.

00:44:29.883 --> 00:44:35.940
The reason's because it's not one thing,
it's 3.

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:40.619
And I will describe that this morning.

00:44:40.619 --> 00:44:43.940
It can be from obesity.
I'm not saying it can't.

00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:48.380
But I think that's actually one of the rare
causes of metabolic syndrome

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:50.500
not one of the common ones.

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.780
Can be from stress
because depressed people lose weight

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:57.860
but have metabolic syndrome,
and with visceral fat

00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:00.739
and finally, you can mainline it,

00:45:00.739 --> 00:45:06.340
you can basically fry your liver
and you can do that at a normal weight

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.860
and having metabolic syndrome.

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:12.139
So I think there are 3 ways to get there

00:45:12.139 --> 00:45:15.099
and I think there are different food stuffs

00:45:15.099 --> 00:45:19.260
that can end behaviors,
that can contribute to them,

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:24.260
and I think
there are ways to parse those 3 path ways

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:31.867
in order to be able to help each person deal
with the problem that has caused theirs.

00:45:31.868 --> 00:45:37.155
But if it's one size fits all,
it will never work.

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:39.139
Yes, I like that approach.

00:45:39.139 --> 00:45:41.500
And the definition doesn't define
the disease,

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:44.539
the definition is basically for billing
purposes more than anything else.

00:45:44.635 --> 00:45:46.219
Indeed. That's right.

00:45:46.219 --> 00:45:49.539
So understand this is metabolic dysfunction
and I'll even give it a better name.

00:45:49.539 --> 00:45:52.659
It's mitochondrial overload.

00:45:52.659 --> 00:45:57.579
Metabolic syndrome is mitochondrial overload
in whatever tissue you're looking at.

00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:01.820
That is metabolic syndrome
and we have the data to prove it.

00:46:01.931 --> 00:46:06.820
Thank you Dr. Lustig for taking the time
to join me today on the DietDoctor podcast.

00:46:06.955 --> 00:46:11.182
-I told you it was Rob.
-It's Rob. I quickly forget, Rob.

00:46:11.283 --> 00:46:14.002
-Thank you so much for joining me.
-My pleasure.

00:46:14.085 --> 00:46:16.098
Now for audience who wants to learn
more about you

00:46:16.099 --> 00:46:18.481
and hear more about what you have to say
where can we direct them?

00:46:18.561 --> 00:46:22.019
Well, there's a website 
robertlustig.com.

00:46:22.019 --> 00:46:24.820
There is eatreal.org,

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:31.500
there will shortly be
a for-profit website biolumen.tech,

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:38.860
about a for-profit venture in an attempt
to bio engineer a solution to this crisis
