COVERING OUR BORDER ISSUES,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.834

OF THE ISSUE, THAT NEW

IMMIGRANTS SHOULD WORK HARD,

00:00:17.574 --> 00:00:18.908
SPEAK ENGLISH, BECAUSE DOING SO

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:20.976

THINGS ARE MOVING SO FAR LEFT

00:01:02.686 --> 00:01:08.424
AND SO FAST THAT THE ENTIRE

"SPEAK ENGLISH" SENTIMENT HAS

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.826

00:01:16.199 --> 00:01:19.201

SAY THIS.

00:01:22.806 --> 00:01:26.742
&gt;&gt; I ALSO HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THAT

00:01:26.743 --> 00:01:27.509
HISPANICS SHOULD WORK HARDER AT

EMBARRASSING TWITTER APOLOGIES.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.905
&gt;&gt; THE IDEA THAT WE THINK AN

00:02:29.906 --> 00:02:31.774
AMERICAN CAN ONLY SPEAK ENGLISH,

00:02:31.775 --> 00:02:33.008
AS IF SPANISH IS NOT PART OF

WHAT

00:02:36.813 --> 00:02:37.546
AMERICA, THAT'S TROUBLING.

00:02:37.547 --> 00:02:39.982
&gt;&gt; THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH

00:02:39.983 --> 00:02:40.783
SPEAKING SPANISH.

00:02:40.784 --> 00:02:42.818

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.154
WHAT HE SAYING IS ABSOLUTELY NOT

TRUE.

00:02:45.455 --> 00:02:48.590
LATINOS ABSOLUTELY ASSIMILATE.

00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:49.291
&gt;&gt; Laura: WELL, THIS IS HOW

00:02:49.292 --> 00:02:51.694
ABOUT A SCOTT IN THE

DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

00:02:52.595 --> 00:02:53.429
MANY LATINOS HAVE ASSIMILATED.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.565
BUT THE MAIN POINT HERE IS

00:02:56.566 --> 00:02:59.935
ENGLISH HAS BECOME CONTROVERSIA

00:02:59.936 --> 00:03:01.337
CONTROVERSIAL.

00:03:01.338 --> 00:03:02.071
ASSIMILATION'S IN SOME QUARTERS

00:03:02.072 --> 00:03:05.007
HAS BECOME CONTROVERSIAL.

00:03:05.008 --> 00:03:06.909
SO TO BE AN AUTHENTIC, CREDIBLE

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.576
DEMOCRAT TODAY, YOU HAVE TO

00:03:07.577 --> 00:03:10.479
BELIEVE THAT THE PARTIES VIEWS

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.848
OF JUST A FEW YEARS AGO ARE

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:13.415
NOW BASICALLY RACIST,

00:03:13.416 --> 00:03:15.517
XENOPHOBIC, AND HATEFUL.

00:03:15.518 --> 00:03:19.188
THIS IS INSANE.

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:21.056
NOW SOMETHING SIMILAR UNFOLDED

00:03:21.057 --> 00:03:21.757
AT DUKE UNIVERSITY OVER THE

00:03:21.758 --> 00:03:23.359
WEEKEND AS WELL.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.194
THE POLITICALLY CORRECT FANATICS

00:03:25.195 --> 00:03:27.096
IN ACADEMIA PUT ANOTHER TROPHY

00:03:27.097 --> 00:03:28.731
ON THE WALL WHEN A ASSISTANT

00:03:28.732 --> 00:03:30.232
PROFESSOR MEGAN NEELY, WHO

00:03:30.233 --> 00:03:32.568
HEADED UP THE UNIVERSITY'S

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:33.602
BIOSTATISTICS MASTER PROGRAM,

00:03:33.603 --> 00:03:35.871
WAS FORCED TO STEP DOWN FROM HER

00:03:35.872 --> 00:03:37.673
POST THIS WEEKEND.

00:03:37.674 --> 00:03:39.975
HER CRIME IN AN EMAIL?

00:03:39.976 --> 00:03:41.977
SHE SENT TO GRAD STUDENTS LAST

00:03:41.978 --> 00:03:44.980
FRIDAY, AND IT, SHE SAID TWO

00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:47.216
FACULTY MEMBERS HAVE COME UP TO

00:03:47.217 --> 00:03:49.651
HER TO COMPLAIN ABOUT STUDENTS

00:03:49.652 --> 00:03:50.986
LOUDLY SPEAKING CHINESE AND A

00:03:50.987 --> 00:03:51.387
COMMON AREA.

00:03:51.388 --> 00:03:55.157
SO SHE WROTE THAT BOTH WERE

00:03:55.158 --> 00:03:56.358
DISAPPOINTED THAT THE STUDENTS

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.360
WEREN'T WORKING TO IMPROVE THEIR

00:03:58.361 --> 00:03:58.694
ENGLISH.

00:03:58.695 --> 00:04:02.765
HER PIGS IN WAS URGING THEM TO

00:04:02.766 --> 00:04:03.700
"COMMIT TO SPEAKING

00:04:04.634 --> 00:04:08.971
ENGLISH 100% OF THE TIME WHILE

00:04:08.972 --> 00:04:09.371
ON CAMPUS."

00:04:09.372 --> 00:04:10.973
PERISH THE THOUGHT.

00:04:10.974 --> 00:04:13.142
AGAIN, IT WAS NOT A SLAM ON

00:04:13.143 --> 00:04:13.475
CHINESE.

00:04:13.476 --> 00:04:15.044
IT WAS KIND OF A HAM-FISTED WAY

00:04:15.045 --> 00:04:18.414
OF ENCOURAGING FOLKS TO SPEAK

00:04:18.415 --> 00:04:19.748
OUR LANGUAGE WHILE IN OUR

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:20.382
COUNTRY.

00:04:20.383 --> 00:04:21.984
STUDYING, BY THE WAY, AT ONE OF

00:04:21.985 --> 00:04:24.887
OUR PREMIER UNIVERSITIES.

00:04:24.888 --> 00:04:26.989
NOW IT WAS ULTIMATELY TO HELP

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.424
THE STUDENTS COMPETE FOR

00:04:28.425 --> 00:04:29.024
PROJECTS AND EMPLOYMENT.

00:04:29.025 --> 00:04:30.659
WHY IS THAT A BAD THING?

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.163
THE HORROR!

00:04:34.164 --> 00:04:34.830
AGAIN, THE ACCUSED PROFUSELY

00:04:34.831 --> 00:04:37.566
APOLOGIZED FOR HER LANGUAGE

00:04:37.567 --> 00:04:37.900
OFFENSE.

00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:39.401
BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER.

00:04:39.402 --> 00:04:40.836
THE DAMAGE WAS ALREADY DONE.

00:04:40.837 --> 00:04:42.771
NOW LOOK, AS I'VE SAID MANY

00:04:42.772 --> 00:04:46.375
TIMES, I SPEAK RUSSIAN, I SPEAK

00:04:46.376 --> 00:04:47.876
ENGLISH, I SPEAK SPANISH, IT IS

00:04:47.877 --> 00:04:49.778
TERRIFIC FOR KIDS TO SPEAK

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:50.579
MULTIPLE LANGUAGES.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.214
BEING BILINGUAL, TRILINGUAL,

00:04:52.215 --> 00:04:54.383
THAT GIVES KIDS A HUGE LEG UP IN

00:04:54.384 --> 00:04:56.785
THIS ECONOMY, AND A LOT OF

00:04:56.786 --> 00:04:57.119
OPTIONS.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.053
BUT OF THE SAME TIME, ENGLISH IS

00:04:58.054 --> 00:05:00.556
OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE.

00:05:00.557 --> 00:05:02.257
AND FOLKS WHO WANT TO COME HERE

00:05:02.258 --> 00:05:02.991
ILLEGALLY SHOULD LEARN TO SPEAK

00:05:02.992 --> 00:05:03.992
IT.

00:05:03.993 --> 00:05:05.961
THERE IS NOTHING RACIST ABOUT

00:05:05.962 --> 00:05:07.162
SAYING THAT AT ALL.

00:05:07.163 --> 00:05:09.431
UNLESS OBAMA, GEORGE W, AND

00:05:09.432 --> 00:05:10.265
PRETTY MUCH EVERY AMERICAN

00:05:10.266 --> 00:05:11.467
PRESIDENT IS ALSO RACIST.

00:05:11.468 --> 00:05:13.802
AND IF AN AMERICAN WHO IS

00:05:13.803 --> 00:05:16.905
SHOPPING IN A STORE GETS, I

00:05:16.906 --> 00:05:18.540
DON'T KNOW, AND PATIENT WHEN A

00:05:18.541 --> 00:05:20.175
CASHIER CAN'T SPEAK ENGLISH,

00:05:20.176 --> 00:05:21.443
THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MAKE

00:05:21.444 --> 00:05:23.879
THE PREACHER AND A OR A BAD

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.213
PERSON.

00:05:24.214 --> 00:05:28.784
THEY ARE FRUSTRATED.

00:05:28.785 --> 00:05:31.520
WHAT WOULD TEDDY ROOSEVELT THINK

00:05:31.521 --> 00:05:32.020
TODAY?

00:05:32.021 --> 00:05:33.055
REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID SO

00:05:33.056 --> 00:05:35.457
ELOQUENTLY IN A LETTER THAT HE

00:05:35.458 --> 00:05:38.494
HAD WRITTEN IN 1919.

00:05:38.495 --> 00:05:39.761
HE SAID, "IN THE FIRST PLACE, WE

00:05:39.762 --> 00:05:40.429
SHOULD INSIST THAT IF THE

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.997
IMMIGRANT TO COME SEE HER IN

00:05:41.998 --> 00:05:43.232
GOOD FAITH BECOMES AN AMERICAN,

00:05:43.233 --> 00:05:46.435
AND ASSIMILATE HIMSELF TO US,

00:05:46.436 --> 00:05:47.703
HE SHALL BE TREATED ON AN EXACT

00:05:47.704 --> 00:05:50.772
EQUALITY WITH EVERYONE ELSE.

00:05:50.773 --> 00:05:51.406
THERE CAN BE NO DIVIDED

00:05:51.407 --> 00:05:53.542
ALLEGIANCE HERE.

00:05:53.543 --> 00:05:55.210
WE HAVE ROOM FOR ABOUT ONE

00:05:55.211 --> 00:05:55.911
LANGUAGE HERE AND THAT IS THE

00:05:55.912 --> 00:05:57.279
ENGLISH LANGUAGE.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.616
FOR WE INTEND TO SEE THAT

00:06:00.617 --> 00:06:03.152
CRUCIBLE TURNS OUR PEOPLE OUT AS

00:06:03.153 --> 00:06:05.087
AMERICANS OF AMERICAN

00:06:05.088 --> 00:06:07.256
NATIONALITY AND NOT AS DWELLERS

00:06:07.257 --> 00:06:09.324
IN A POLYGLOT BOARDINGHOUSE."

00:06:09.325 --> 00:06:12.861
I WANT TO BECOME A POLYGLOT

00:06:12.862 --> 00:06:15.197
BOARDINGHOUSE -- IT'S NOT JUST,

00:06:15.198 --> 00:06:15.797
THOUGH, THAT THE ENGLISH

00:06:15.798 --> 00:06:17.366
LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT CAN SET UP

00:06:17.367 --> 00:06:18.033
TODAY'S DEMOCRAT CONFORMITY

00:06:18.034 --> 00:06:18.367
POLICE.

00:06:18.368 --> 00:06:20.369
NOT JUST THAT.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.203
EVEN THE TWO TERM VICE PRESIDENT

00:06:21.204 --> 00:06:24.139
ISN'T IMMUNE.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.674
BIDEN, JOE BIDEN, WAS WRAPPED

00:06:25.675 --> 00:06:28.710
LAST WEEK FOR DARING TO SAY A

00:06:28.711 --> 00:06:32.781
NICE THING ABOUT A REPUBLICAN.

00:06:32.782 --> 00:06:34.116
&gt;&gt; I GET IN TROUBLE -- I READ IN

00:06:34.117 --> 00:06:36.185
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" TODAY THAT

00:06:36.186 --> 00:06:39.154
I -- ONE OF MY PROBLEMS IS IF I

00:06:39.155 --> 00:06:42.157
EVER RUN FOR PRESIDENT, I LIKE

00:06:42.158 --> 00:06:42.558
REPUBLICANS.

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:43.292
OKAY, WELL BLESS ME FATHER, FOR

00:06:43.293 --> 00:06:50.699

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.336
BUT YOU KNOW, WHERE I COME FROM,

00:06:54.337 --> 00:06:55.537
I DON'T HOW TO GET ANYTHING

00:06:55.538 --> 00:06:55.837
DONE.

00:06:55.838 --> 00:06:57.005
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GET

00:06:57.006 --> 00:06:58.574
ANYTHING DONE -- THE ONLY WAY

00:06:58.575 --> 00:06:59.942
YOU GET ANYTHING DONE AS IF YOU

00:06:59.943 --> 00:07:01.210
START TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER

00:07:01.211 --> 00:07:01.510
AGAIN.

00:07:01.511 --> 00:07:03.512
&gt;&gt; Laura: SO COMMON SENSE FROM

00:07:03.513 --> 00:07:03.812
BIDEN.

00:07:03.813 --> 00:07:05.080
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO REACH

00:07:05.081 --> 00:07:05.647
ACROSS THE AISLE.

00:07:05.648 --> 00:07:08.650
HE GOT A SLAM FOR THAT IN

00:07:08.651 --> 00:07:09.184
LEFT-WING QUARTERS.

00:07:09.185 --> 00:07:10.219
I LOVE GOING ONLINE TO SEE WHAT

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.287
THEY ARE ALL SAYING.

00:07:12.288 --> 00:07:16.158
NOT   CONTINUING, EVEN IF YOU MS

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:17.726
COMEDIAN IS FORCED TO PLAY BY

00:07:17.727 --> 00:07:19.294
THE SHIFTING ROLES OF THE LEFT

00:07:19.295 --> 00:07:19.595
TODAY.

00:07:19.596 --> 00:07:20.829
REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:21.797
THAT KEVIN HART WOULD BE THE

00:07:21.798 --> 00:07:24.333
HOST OF THE ACADEMY AWARDS?

00:07:24.334 --> 00:07:26.401
WELL, AT THEIR MERCY CROWD DUG

00:07:26.402 --> 00:07:27.869
UP 10-YEAR-OLD TWEETS AND

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.105
CHARGED HIM WITH BEING

00:07:30.106 --> 00:07:30.505
HOMOPHOBIC.

00:07:30.506 --> 00:07:35.177
SO EVEN AFTER HE APOLOGIZED AND

00:07:35.178 --> 00:07:36.511
ELLEN CAME OUT TO SUPPORT THEM,

00:07:36.512 --> 00:07:39.014
THE LEFT WOULD NOT BE SATISFIED.

00:07:39.015 --> 00:07:40.415
&gt;&gt; WITH ALL THIS BEING SAID IN

00:07:40.416 --> 00:07:41.149
ALL THIS CONTROVERSY AND ALL THE

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.285
WAY THAT YOU HAVE ADJUSTED, IS

00:07:43.286 --> 00:07:46.188

00:07:46.756 --> 00:07:48.957
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:49.858
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTE NO?

00:07:49.859 --> 00:07:50.926
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:07:50.927 --> 00:07:52.961
I'M NOT HOSTING THE OSCARS THIS

00:07:52.962 --> 00:07:53.362

00:07:58.635 --> 00:07:59.368
PASS, THAT THE OSCARS WILL

00:07:59.369 --> 00:08:05.140
BE HOST WAS THIS YEAR.

00:08:05.141 --> 00:08:05.974
TALK ANOTHER ONE RUN-UP THE

00:08:05.975 --> 00:08:06.775
SENSITIVITY SQUAD.

00:08:06.776 --> 00:08:08.543
I WAS GOING, GUYS.

00:08:08.544 --> 00:08:09.578
ALL THIS DEMONSTRATES THE

00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:13.015
DEMOCRATS IN POLITICS, THE

00:08:13.016 --> 00:08:15.083
MEDIA, ACADEMIA, ARE ZEALOUS

00:08:15.084 --> 00:08:17.719
ABOUT ENFORCING BORDERS AFTER

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.020
ALL.

00:08:18.021 --> 00:08:19.021
THEIR OWN.

00:08:19.022 --> 00:08:21.556
THE AGGRESSIVELY POLICE THEIR

00:08:21.557 --> 00:08:23.959
OWN EVER MORPHING CODE OF

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.793
PROGRESSIVE ETHICS.

00:08:24.794 --> 00:08:25.761
AND IF YOU RUN AFOUL OF THEM,

00:08:25.762 --> 00:08:28.563
THEY ARE MERCY -- THEIR

00:08:28.564 --> 00:08:30.132
MERCENARIES WILL DESTROY

00:08:30.133 --> 00:08:30.399
YOU.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.735
AND IN SOME CASES, EVEN PROFUSE,

00:08:33.736 --> 00:08:34.403
ABJECT, YES, EMBARRASSING

00:08:34.404 --> 00:08:37.139
APOLOGIES WILL NOT SUFFICE.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.174
SO TODAY, YOU MAY BE PART OF THE

00:08:39.175 --> 00:08:43.413
COOL CROWD, BUT TOMORROW, YOU
