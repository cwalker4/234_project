00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.400
In the two decades following
the Second World War,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.080
the British aircraft industry
flourished

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.480
in a pageant of ingenuity
and innovation.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.480
REPORTER: A brilliant new
all-British achievement made
headline news throughout the world.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.640
Aviation was Britain's largest
industry and for a few golden years,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.720
it led the world.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.960
REPORTER: Britain's Comet
jet airliner

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.640
has again been breaking
records.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.800
Whichever way you looked at it, there
was no plane like it in the world.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.080
Britain had invented the jet engine
and proven it in warplanes

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.040
but the new jet age was set to
change passenger transport, too.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.360
People couldn't understand how a jet
aircraft actually worked.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.640
It was a sort of magic, in a way.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.120
Things could happen.
Britain could make it.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.120
We were giving to reach for the sky.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.560
Tails up for Britain.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.440
Aircraft and the men who flew them
were the stars of the age.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.840
Thousands flocked to witness
the daring feats of pilots

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.960
like "Cat's Eyes" Cunningham,
wartime night fighter ace.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.040
We needed our heroes.
God knows we needed our heroes.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.440
Sometimes, the confidence
was shaken by tragedy.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.960
But this was the age of the jet,
when Britain ruled the skies.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.800
It was going to be
the aeroplane that showed

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.120
that we were still world players.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.160
When Queen Elizabeth came to the
throne,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.040
a lot was happening for Britain.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.400
We were coming out of austerity,
ration books were soon to end,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.040
Hillary and Tenzing climbed
to the top of Mount Everest,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.440
Roger Bannister ran a mile
in under four minutes.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.480
REPORTER: The tape has broken,
and so is the record athletes have
long been dreaming about.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.480
Look at that excitement.
Look at those achievements.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.480
There was a kind of feeling,

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.280
that was being quite shamelessly
promoted on all sides,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.040
of the new Elizabethan era,

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.440
leading to a kind of Renaissance,
a rebirth of British enterprise.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.920
Thank God we could now put
the War behind us,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.960
but use a lot of the technology
we developed in the War

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.800
for peaceful purposes.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.920
Foremost among those technologies
was a new generation of jets,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.600
powerful enough to turn these new
Elizabethans

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.360
into world leaders in civil
aviation.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.160
REPORTER: Here it is.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.360
In the precise language
of the engineer,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.880
it's called a jet propulsion
gas turbine.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.200
To you and me, it's the jet engine,

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.520
one of the marvels of this century
of marvels.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.960
The jet engine was world beating
technology and it was British.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.560
REPORTER: To Farnborough for the
world's greatest airshow.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.560
Britain's faith in jets justified

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.160
and prominent among them,
the Avro Ashton.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.960
This is a development of the Tudor

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.360
with four jet engines
installed in pairs.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.360
It will be used for experimental
work on high-altitude jet flights.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.760
Altogether, of the 60 planes
on show, nearly half were jets.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.920
The Farnborough airshow was the
showcase for the best of British.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.840
Every September, crowds would flock
to Hampshire

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.600
to see the most amazing aircraft
the country could produce.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.840
They were family days of picnics,
charabancs and stiff necks.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.240
Going to the Farnborough airshow
as a child was a magical experience.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.640
You saw wonderful,
modern aircraft

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.800
that felt so close you could
reach out and touch them.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.600
They were doing aerobatics,

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.000
they were nearly all demonstrated
by test pilots

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.160
who could make them
do wonderful things

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.000
and to see this was so inspiring.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.920
I never, ever grew
out of wanting to be a pilot.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.880
Gosh! She's wizard.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.120
It was the best of British
technology

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.400
and you had this wonderful meeting
of all sections of British society.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.480
You saw the latest civil planes,

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.240
soaring round, performing near
aerobatics right over your head.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.760
As a child, that was
just glorious stuff.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.160
The aircraft names seemed magical.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.160
Fairey and English Electric,
Sopwith and Supermarine,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.640
Vickers-Armstrong, Handley Page,
Hunting, Saunders-Roe and Short,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.920
Gloucester and de Havilland,
Bristol and Blackburn.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.600
It seemed incredible
that in peace time,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.640
one small country could still
sustain so many manufacturers,

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.960
turning out so many promising
aircraft.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.920
REPORTER: Final verdict
on Farnborough,

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.320
Britain's aircraft industry
consolidates its supremacy.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.360
But these bright new aircraft
were the results of secret plans

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.640
laid in the darkest days of war.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.120
ALARM BELL RINGS

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.120
With the outbreak of World War II,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.280
all production of civil aircraft
had halted

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.840
to concentrate on the fighters
and bombers that would protect
our shores.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.200
As early as 1942, however,
a committee was set up

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.200
to plan the peace time future
of British civil aviation.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.320
The Brabazon Committee was set up,
really, in the depths of the War

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.920
but at least we had El Alamein
and Stalingrad,

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.120
so it looked like we were
going to win.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.120
So the problem was then,

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.280
how was Britain going to use its big
aircraft industry

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.480
to try and compete
with the Americans

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.160
when the Americans have got
all the transport aircraft

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.720
while we've been building fighters
and bombers?

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.880
And led by Lord Brabazon,

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.400
the man who had the first pilot's
licence in Britain,

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.760
and the famous numberplate,
FLY1, to prove it,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.760
he and the team came up
with a set of aircraft

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.640
that they believed,
in the long-term,

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.480
would allow Britain
to prove its worth

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.920
and compete on world air routes.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.760
The Brabazon Committee decided
that Britain needed

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.160
a family of planes to serve short
and medium haul,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.200
domestic and European destinations

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.240
and the long haul flights
of the north Atlantic

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.280
and the routes of Empire.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:34.000
With this masterplan in place,
tenders went out to leading
manufacturers.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.760
The result was extraordinary.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.840
An astonishing outpouring

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.440
of wildly different passenger
aircraft designs,

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.160
all been produced simultaneously.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.160
At the time, jet propulsion was fast

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.600
but much too thirsty
for long haul flights.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.200
Watch that gallon go!

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.080
So Type I
on the Brabazon Committee's list

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.800
was a massive petrol-driven,
piston-engined aircraft.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.120
Unveiled in 1949,
this leviathan promised splendid,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.440
luxurious travel for the rich
and privileged.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.880
Awe-inspiring, jaw-droppingly huge.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.280
REPORTER: Here she comes.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.800
130 tonnes of superlative
engineering.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.280
Six years of research,
ingenuity, invention.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.040
Sycophantically,
Bristol named this aircraft

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.720
after the great Lord himself.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.440
It was henceforth
the Bristol Brabazon.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.120
Creating a liner of the air,
passengers would travel in style.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.040
They would have their own bunks
in private cabins, powder rooms,

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.120
a cocktail bar
and even a separate cinema.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.960
Chief test pilot on the Brabazon
and was Bill Pegg.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.720
He had worked stolidly for Bristol
since the mid '30s.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.240
Crowds would gather
wherever it flew.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.800
Faster, faster! The nose wheel
is off! The nose wheel is off!

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.440
I'm looking to see the main wheel.
The main wheel's come off.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.200
She's off!

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.840
She's off!

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.000
She's hopped along the grass!
The Brabazon is in the air!

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.960
The Brabazon was designed
to cruise at 250 mph,

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.040
carrying 100 passengers, and take
17 hours to fly the Atlantic.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.720
The Brabazon was a good idea
at the time.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.600
They assumed that with a new
generation of piston engines,

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.560
it would become very much
more efficient.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.840
It was built for
the transatlantic route.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.560
The wingspan of the Brabazon
was 11 metres greater

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.520
than that of a jumbo jet.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.320
It was stupendously huge.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.360
It was an aircraft
that really harked back

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.720
to the pre-war concept of flying,

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.440
that it would be only
for the very wealthy.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.560
They were after the first-class
passengers from the Queen Mary

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.920
and if you were going to cram them
for 17 hours crossing the Atlantic,

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.880
they needed space, they needed
stewards, they needed a dining room.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.720
The Brabazon pioneered
high-pressure hydraulics

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.280
and electric engine controls.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:20.040
But the aircraft was unmistakably
old, piston-driven technology,

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.480
out of time and out of place
in the new Elizabethan age.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.840
By 1953, no airline had ordered her.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.720
Impressive as she was,
her future was the scrapheap,

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.360
without ever taking
a fare-paying customer.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.680
A contemporary of the Brabazon,

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.200
the Vickers Viscount may have had
propellers

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.360
but it was what lay behind them
that made the difference,

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.320
and that was the jet turbine.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.920
The aircraft was revolutionary

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.160
because it introduced a new kind
of engine, the turboprop engine,

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.480
which is basically a jet engine
with a propeller on the front.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:05.800
The major advantage with
the turboprop engine, of course,
is fuel economy.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.400
It was so much cheaper to run
than a piston engine aircraft.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.160
REPORTER: The propeller turbine is
not a stand-in for the pure jet.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.760
The air screw is still considered
the most efficient

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.000
medium for transforming power
into thrust.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.960
The designer of the Vickers Viscount
was the legendary,

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.040
if somewhat tight-lipped,
George Edwards.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.600
It was clear to us
as far back as 1945,

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.280
that this was a great advance
on anything that had gone before.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.080
An ordinary,
conventional engine vibrates

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.880
because of the pistons jumping up
and down inside it.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.000
Imagine what 14 pistons must do
in just one engine

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.920
running at 25,000 piston
movements a minute.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.120
The propeller turbine,
on the other hand,

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.760
has no up-and-down moving parts
such as pistons or valves.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.520
This is how it works.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.400
Air is drawn in at the front,
compressed in the compressor

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.720
and pushed into the combustion
chamber.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.240
There it's heated and it rushes
through the turbine.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.480
The turbine drives the compressor
and in turn a propeller.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.480
The exhaust provides jet propulsion
so that no power is wasted.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:18.440
So we designed an aeroplane
to give us speed, range, economy

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.600
and four-engine reliability.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.880
We built it and we called it
the Viscount.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.160
I name this aircraft Discovery.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:34.120
May God bless her and all who fly
with her. Hip, hip, hurray!

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.120
The first aircraft had entered
service in 1950,

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.280
well ahead of schedule.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:45.440
The nursing mother of the Viscount
was BEA, British European Airways.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.280
The Viscount was funded by them and
tightly designed around their needs.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.840
But its performance and comfort
proved enduringly popular

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.080
with airlines and passengers
all around the world.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.960
Nowadays, people have no idea,
because they've never flown in
a propeller driven aircraft,

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.520
how incredibly noisy
and uncomfortable they are.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.840
Bumpy and constant vibration.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:15.160
Suddenly, with the Viscount,
all that went
and they were flying higher

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.560
because it was a pressurised cabin,
above the weather.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:22.200
It was smooth, it was wonderful
and passengers just loved it.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.160
We're off! Isn't it super?

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.000
REPORTER: This 50-seater medium
ranged airliner,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
with a cruising speed
of 312 miles an hour,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.840
is powered by four turbo propeller
engines.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.040
She is here seen flying
with three of them.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.080
The Viscount is arguably
the most successful
British airliner ever built.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.760
Maybe not in numbers, but as far
as success around the world.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.280
REPORTER: The American visitors were
so impressed with the workmanship,
economy and design

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:54.360
that they signed a contract for
three of the aircraft to the value
of over a million pounds

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.160
and what's more, they have taken
an option on a further 37.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.520
The Viscount will be the first
British airliner

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.440
on a scheduled service in America.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.520
As Americans did not have
a turboprop of their own,

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.800
the Viscount was the ideal aircraft

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.520
to take on the all-important
US market.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.240
Not only did capital airlines
fly the Viscount,

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:21.720
they also admired its virtues in
that warming, homespun way that only
Americans can fake.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.000
Yes, it's a new standard of service.
Capital Airlines' Viscount.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.120
If you've been riding in the cockpit
of aeroplanes as long as I have,

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.840
it's a real thrill to see a plane
like the Viscount come along.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.800
It's tops with the pilots.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.200
Capital Airlines is proud of over
a quarter of a century

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.920
of serving air-minded America

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.440
and we're extremely proud
to be the first carrier

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:52.960
in the United States to introduce
the Viscount, with its four engines.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.080
The Viscount also proved its worth
in the harshest conditions.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:04.720
Captain Ron MacDonald was
a pilot for Trans-Canada Air.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.640
Most of my flying was in the
Maritimes, which we call in Canada,

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.280
which is New Brunswick, Nova Scotia
and Newfoundland.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.080
The weather, of course,
was quite atrocious at times,

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.680
in the Maritimes, but the Viscount
was an extremely stable aircraft

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.640
to make an approach on,

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:27.560
so that you can get her down in 200
foot ceilings of heavy rain or snow

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.720
and it was an excellent aeroplane

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.160
for the environment
that we had to use it in.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.600
We had become the top airline
in North America,

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.360
using the best equipment
that was available.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.480
The Viscount,
with its Rolls-Royce Dart engines

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.480
was an instant hit
with the passengers.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.360
Smooth enough not to shake
the Babycham,

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.800
quiet enough to have a conversation.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.800
And with windows large enough
to watch the world go by.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.600
These must be the Alps.
Let me see!

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.600
Don't jump about!

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.440
You can see quite clearly.
The window's bigger than you are.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:12.240
By the end of its production,
over 450 Viscounts would
fly worldwide for 80 airlines.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.680
A great British plane.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.880
But the key thing about it was,

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.880
it did what it was supposed to do,

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:24.200
which is why a fairly large number
of passengers fairly economically,

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.640
because it was a turboprop
rather than a pure jet,

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:33.840
from Stuttgart to London or
from Arizona to Nebraska or whatever.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.120
Which is why the plane
sold in America.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.760
The Americans didn't have a plane
which could do that job.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.200
The Viscount was a short haul
aircraft.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.920
On the long haul transatlantic
passenger routes,

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.440
it was the Americans who
still dominated.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:56.360
They used mass production,
piston-driven aircraft that were
modelled on World War II technology.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:01.640
Their Constellation was developed
from a wartime military transport.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:06.600
While the Superfortress bomber
became the Boeing Stratocruiser.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.440
The Stratocruiser
could carry 55 passengers

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.440
and had, as a feature, a spiral
staircase down to a cocktail bar.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.680
In the '50s, even Britain's
intercontinental airline BOAC,

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.120
the British Overseas Airways
Corporation,

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.240
flew Uncle Sam's planes.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:33.040
But American technology was old
technology. Noisy, '40s technology.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.320
Britain had the jet

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.160
and with our next big jet-powered
aircraft of the '50s,

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.480
it looked as if we would land
the killer blow.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.200
REPORTER: Britain's aircraft
may have a winner in the Comet.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.640
I quote the sober view
of aviation critics.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.400
The de Havilland company
have produced

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.960
this four-engine jet airliner,
the first in the world,

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.160
largely from experiments
carried out on the little 108.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.000
The pilots are famous war ace
Cunningham and Johnny Wilson.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.400
Cunningham talks
to Sir Frank Whittle on the left,
the inventor of the jet.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:12.400
No airliner came close
to the Comet's beauty or speed,

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:17.200
the distinctive whistle of its ghost
engines thrilling the crowd
wherever it went.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.960
It was a jetliner that could
travel twice as high

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.240
and twice as fast as anything else.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.640
Smooth and high above the weather,
it was a transportive delight

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:32.280
and at least five years ahead
of anything proposed by our rivals.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.600
It was the shape of things to come.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.600
Suddenly, out of very often things

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:43.640
which were little more than sheds and
garages and fairly rundown buildings,

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.640
people had conceived the future.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.280
A completely new way of flying

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.400
and a completely new way
of looking at aeroplanes.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.160
What struck me about it was

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.720
you looked at this magnificent silver
aircraft

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.040
and you looked at the surroundings
of the silver aircraft,

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.040
which are chaps in cloth caps,

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.720
ancient movie cameras
trying to film this plane,

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:09.120
in the middle of it is something
that is utterly timeless.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.960
To make the vision reality,

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:16.440
de Havilland needed sales in volume
and that meant getting the backing

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.400
of the state-funded British Overseas
Airways Corporation.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.120
Only they could guarantee
the Comet's success.

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.520
There were plenty of reasons
for caution.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:30.080
For one thing, air routes all over
the world were only equipped
to handle aeroplanes

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:34.160
travelling about half the speed
and half the height of a Comet.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.320
Of course there were
plenty of reasons for caution

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.720
but get sufficient numbers of the
new aircraft into service quickly

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.800
and Britain might, at one stroke,

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.880
find herself years ahead
of her competitors.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.400
The Comet was stunning
when it first emerged.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.400
It had been kept secret,
under wartime levels of secrecy,

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.400
until it rolled out in July 1949

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.200
and then, of course,
it caused a sensation.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.760
It was so new, so sleek,
so silver, so beautiful.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.840
The Comet, with its signature square
windows and rakishly swept wings,

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.040
shrank the globe.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.960
The first four-jet airliner,
Britain's already famous Comet,

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.560
made worldwide news by its
astonishing flight to North Africa
and back.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.840
This wonderful machine's
total time in the air

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.040
for a distance
of just under 3,000 miles

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.880
was a mere six hours, 38 minutes.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.800
De Havilland's test pilot,
John Cunningham,

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:34.560
was the quintessential company man,
always facing every interview
with a broad, innocent smile.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.960
And it gave us an average speed,

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.880
from take-off to flying over
the airfield at the other end,

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.240
of about 450 miles an hour.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.440
London to Copenhagen
in one hour, 18 minutes.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.480
The newspapers of the time,
free of any doubt,

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.480
proclaimed the Comet
as a world-beater.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.400
Karachi, flying time,
ten hours, 21 minutes.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.640
It was at a time when I went off
to interview John Cunningham.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.640
He told me that soon after
he first flew it,

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.760
a test pilot from Lockheed,

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:10.480
and Lockheed, at the time,
was one of the principal American
aircraft manufacturers,

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:17.640
Cunningham took that Lockheed pilot
up in the Comet to 30,000 feet.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:21.680
The Lockheed pilot was completely
blown away by it.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.560
He said, "I cannot believe this
plane. This is unbelievable."

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.320
And it was.
It represented the future.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.200
And for a country which had
run out of money,

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.560
which Britain had
at the end of the '40s,

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:36.920
a country whose achievements were
vast and largely in the past

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:40.760
and whose present was one of
being in hock to the Americans
for evermore,

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:45.200
this suddenly seemed to represent
a get out of austerity easily.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:50.240
And that, I think,
is one of the reasons why
the Comet was so important then.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.840
I remember going to Heathrow,

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:55.600
dragging my mother to Heathrow,
to see the Comet

00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:01.640
when the old Northside passenger
terminals were canvas tents, mostly.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.760
And then this wonderful silver
apparition with the BOAC markings,

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.280
whining as it rolled by.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.440
This great howl
from the ghost engines.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:18.840
Took your breath away. It was
so lovely, so smooth. Terrific.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.280
Sir Miles Thomas, chairman of BOAC,
greeted the Queen

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.160
and Duke of Edinburgh at London's
British Industries Fair.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.360
The Royal attention focused
on a scale model Comet,

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.880
for a few days before,
this record-breaking aircraft

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.160
had again made the front pages
by going into regular service

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:42.200
as the world's first
passenger-carrying jet airline.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.480
The Comet's first scheduled service
was the air mail run

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.560
down to Rome and on to Africa

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:52.520
and the dominions of the Empire
to set down finally in Johannesburg.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.160
Excuse me, gentleman.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.320
We shall be arriving
at Ciampino Airport, Rome,

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.280
in about five minutes.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.160
There will be an airport official
to meet you and take you

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.160
to the restaurant, where you will
be served with afternoon tea.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.000
In London operations room,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.880
news of the Comet's landing
was flashed from Rome.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.480
What time did they arrive there?
1533. 1533. One minute late.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.440
Could you put it up for me, please?
Yes. Certainly.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.240
As we approached Entebbe,
we saw Lake Victoria beneath us.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.160
A 200-mile stretch
of shimmering water

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.640
right at the end of the runway.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.920
Before we reached Livingstone,

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:36.000
Captain Marston came in to see
how we were getting along.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.040
It may be a bit turbulent.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.040
I don't guarantee it every time!

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.200
ENGINE ROAR DROWNS SPEECH

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.280
Oh, well, that's not too bad, is it?

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.920
It shows it's all very smooth,
this flight, isn't it?

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.560
And as I was searching my mind
for the words to describe

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.600
this completely new experience
in flying,

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.280
our destination came into view

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.080
and below us lay
the great blocks of city buildings

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.800
and the golden slag heaps
from the mines.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.960
The roots of Empire
were still vital.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.960
Yes, the writing was on the wall.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:26.320
It was clearly going to be axed,
slowly or quickly, nobody quite new.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.400
India had already gone in '47.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:33.000
But we had large areas
of the planet to control

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.200
and military to get out there
and to service

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.200
and civil servants
and all the rest of it.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.840
So, right to the Far East,
right down to the south,

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.000
southern tip of Africa,
we had to preserve air routes.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:53.320
Orders started to pour in
from Air France,

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:57.280
Air India, Japan, Venezuela
and Brazil

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.240
and even from the United States.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.040
But then curious accidents
started to happen

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:08.280
that had not featured
during Cunningham's testing.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:13.360
This Comet belly-landed on Rome's
Ciampino airfield at takeoff.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:17.240
Not one of the 36 passengers
or crew of six was hurt,

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.360
a fact which reflects credit
on the jet airliner,

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.880
as well as on the coolness
and skill of its pilot.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.440
The design of the Comet's wings
appeared vulnerable

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.360
to stalling on takeoff,
a problem known as over rotation.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.320
The pilots could actually raise
the nose of the aircraft

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:39.760
too high on takeoff, which disturbed
the airflow into the engine,

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.080
it dropped its efficiency

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:46.640
and also disturbed the airflow over
the wings and that killed the lift.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.240
Conversely,
if you didn't rotate enough,

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.880
you just never took off at all.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:54.960
You remained in ground effect.
So it was very tricky.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.960
John Cunningham, one of the finest
test pilots in the world,

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.240
he knew the aeroplane so well

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:04.000
that he never got himself
into an over rotate position.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.280
But on a dark, rainy night,
which airline pilots work in,

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:12.960
test pilots very rarely do,
the situation is quite different.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.880
The first accident seemed
like straightforward pilot error

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.240
but then one of Ron MacDonald's
Canadian friends,

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:23.960
Captain Charles Pentland,
crashed on takeoff in Karachi,

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.160
killing all on board.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.800
Everybody thought that Charlie was
the one man that would never

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.760
get himself into this situation.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.000
Unfortunately, over rotation occurred

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.240
and the aircraft never left
the ground.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.840
It just went off the runway
and blew up and killed everybody.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.480
So it was apparently maybe
the instrumentation

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.400
didn't give you the degrees of pitch
that you required,

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:53.400
which we had on later aircraft.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:58.320
The real problem with the Comet
was that, being a jet aircraft,

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:02.920
it was much less forgiving
than propeller-driven aircraft.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:07.440
Mostly because you don't have the
slipstream going back over

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:12.160
the control surfaces until it's
already reached quite a fast speed.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.520
The problem is that all the people
who flew it

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.960
and all the people who maintained it

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.840
were still thinking vaguely of the
propeller era.

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.920
They didn't realise that the jet era
was something totally different.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.000
While de Havilland set about
addressing

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.960
the problems of the Comet,
their competitors, Bristol,

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:36.760
had come up with an aircraft
to challenge the Americans on the
transatlantic routes.

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:40.960
Bristol needed fuel efficiency
so they chose the turboprop.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:45.160
This new aircraft
they called the Britannia.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.360
REPORTER: The age
of the second Elizabeth,

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.640
bringing with it craftsmanship that
leads the designs of the world.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:57.080
Bristol Britannia was actually
a rather beautiful looking plane.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:01.880
It was also, in theory,
a plane the world needed.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.760
It was a turboprop
but it was quite fast.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.920
350, 400 miles an hour.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.520
It could deliver quite
a lot of passengers

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.120
and it could deliver them
over quite a long distance.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.440
So in some ways, at that time,

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:18.400
it seemed, from a British
standpoint, quite a good idea.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.280
REPORTER: The Britannia.
The airliner of tomorrow.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.760
The plane's first public
appearance

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.240
had been at Farnborough
in September 1952.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.840
The test pilot was the vastly
experienced Bill Pegg,

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:38.400
the man who had first flown
the ill-fated Brabazon.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.800
REPORTER: A lovely,
graceful machine.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.840
It ranks as a milestone equal to
the regular services of the Comet.

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.800
Spectators were astounded
at the quietness of the plane

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.600
and it was soon nicknamed
the "Whispering Giant".

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.000
The forerunner of a fleet on order

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
for the British Overseas Airways
Corporation was the star,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.920
the 100-seater Bristol Britannia
turboprop liner.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:03.720
The Britannia gave a striking
foretaste of the future in a year
of aviation history.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.880
But here, too,
problems started to appear.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:12.240
There were persistent
teething faults
with the Bristol Proteus engines.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.320
Bill Pegg, who has Bristol's chief
test pilot,

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:19.800
was showing some KLM people,
potential customers,

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:23.080
how the Britannia worked
and all the rest of it

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.880
and took off for a flight
from Filton

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.520
and flew them up over South Wales.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.520
At one point,

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.320
one of the engines developed
a serious fault and caught fire.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.200
Eventually,
the entire wing was in flames

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:40.520
and knowing that there were 2,000
gallons of fuel in it,

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.040
Bill Pegg was a little alarmed
about this

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.800
and I think the
KLM people were, too.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.400
Obviously, you couldn't do a crash
landing in the mountains of Wales.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:53.080
My father was sitting in the back
with one of the KLM personnel.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:56.600
The other one was in the right-hand
seat, Pegg in the left-hand seat.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:00.680
I would rather not refer to it
as a terrible crash in the

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.600
River Severn of the Britannia
in February 1954.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.560
It, in fact, was a controlled forced
landing after an engine fire

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.320
developed in number three.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.080
The fire had been raging
for about 20 minutes

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.080
and they were quietly working out

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.640
how long the structural integrity

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:21.200
and systems would continue to operate
on the starboard wing.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.760
What they were frightened of was
that the fire would be so intense,

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.160
because it was fanned
by the slipstream,

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.120
that it would actually
start melting the main spar,

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.400
at which point,
the whole wing folds up.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.320
The whole lot of them would die.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.520
So he had to get to
the ground as quickly as possible

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.360
and over the Severn, he could
see that the estuary tide was out.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:44.160
He landed on the mud flat and they
slid about 400 yards and then turned

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.600
slightly towards the sea and came to
a halt and the fire was out,

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.680
because the engines had inhaled so
much mud, it had stopped the fire.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.200
Everybody came out perfectly
unscathed and all the rest of it,

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.080
and congratulated Bill Pegg.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.840
There was relief when they got out
but that's about it.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.680
I have to say that KLM did not
buy the aircraft.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:08.280
Meanwhile, for the Comet,
the world's only jet liner,

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.200
things had gone from bad
to much worse.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:17.240
REPORTER: This is the tragic scene
of the Comet disaster near Calcutta.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.800
Wreckage of the aircraft smashed
almost beyond recognition.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.720
At the time of this terrible
accident,

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:26.960
the aircraft carried 37 passengers
and a crew of six.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.040
All lost their lives.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.120
The reputation of the world's
most celebrated aircraft

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.600
now hung in the balance.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.480
There is a curious tone
in the British press at the time.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.840
You will find people...
It almost seems to come over

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:43.400
that it's your patriotic duty
to fly in a Comet.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.600
There are articles in which they
suggest the plane may be sabotaged.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:51.360
Within six weeks,
with typical British aplomb,

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:55.240
two plucky Royals were dispatched
to Rhodesia on, of course, a Comet.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.760
The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh
were at London airport

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:03.440
only a few hours after their return
from Scotland
to see Queen Elizabeth,

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.040
the Queen Mother
and Princess Margaret

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.000
off on their flight
to Southern Rhodesia.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.800
And then tragedy struck
on a grand scale.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:17.200
In January 1954 and again in April,
two Comets fell from the skies

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:21.640
into the Mediterranean,
killing all crew and passengers.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.440
The first had been the very plane
that had set records

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:29.160
on that inaugural flight
to Johannesburg.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.680
35 people were on board,
including ten children,

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.720
and there were no survivors.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.720
It was imperative that the cause
of the disaster should be known.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.720
Underwater television cameras,

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.800
built by scientists and technicians
in a number of days,

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.080
were rushed to the scene
and operated by the Royal Navy.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:52.560
The wrecked aircraft was located
and salvage operations began.

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.760
Brought ashore, too, were
the infinitely moving reminders

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.720
of those whose lives were
lost in this disaster of the air.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.720
When I was at school,
I must have been around 11 or 12,

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:07.880
I received an Air Mail letter
from my uncle who was in Hong Kong.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.760
And it was almost illegible
because it was all water stained

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.040
and the address had run
and everything

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.560
and it turned out that it had been
on one of the Comets

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.560
that had crashed in the Mediterranean

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:22.520
and it was one of the letters they
have managed to fish out and deliver.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:25.960
It was very strange and slightly
uncanny, slightly spooky,

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.240
which I think is probably
why I never actually kept it.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.800
The Comet fleet
was immediately grounded,

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.040
pending a full scale investigation.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:42.120
All foreign orders were cancelled.

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.920
Barely a year after the fanfares,

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.400
it seemed as if the Last Post
had sounded for the Comet.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:54.080
At the Royal Aircraft Establishment
at Farnborough, they pieced together

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:57.680
the remains of the wreckage and
forensically analysed the results.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.200
This was the most painstaking

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:06.160
and thorough safety examination
in British aviation history.

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.920
When the Comet was grounded
as a result of the accident,

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:15.480
they had no idea as to why, because,
of course, there were no black boxes

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.760
or anything like that in those days.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.000
They took a Comet fuselage
down to Farnborough

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
and subjected it to constant cycles
of pressure in a water tank.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.840
REPORTER: After it had been filled,
jacks beneath the wings

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.880
caused a series of bumps
as if in flight

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.760
and internal pressure
was raised in the fuselage.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.800
After the equivalent of 5,000
three-hour flights,

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.520
metal fatigue resulted in cracks
and brakes.

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.760
They discovered that a crack
had formed

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:46.240
in a communications aerial
at the corner of it,

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.720
up near the cockpit above it.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.800
Then that had spread along the
corners of the windows.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:55.320
Of course, it had all happened
in an absolute split second.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.800
These key points
of the Comet's fuselage

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.720
had been put under unbearable
strain

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.400
by repeated ascents and descents
at high altitude.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.520
The Comet's metal skin had failed

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:09.320
just forward of its distinctive
square windows.

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:14.040
Then the cabin had exploded
from the rapid decompression.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:19.480
And they did several slow motion
films of a mock-up of this happening

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.280
and they realised
that the sudden decompression,

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:26.640
death would have been instantaneous
for all of the passengers.

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:30.280
With seats being simply torn out
and turned upside down.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:34.400
The whole inside of the cabin
becomes a complete maelstrom

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.440
of bodies and seats and everything

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:40.520
and that would have happened
in a fifth of a second, less.

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.360
Hindsight is always a wonderful thing
and it would be easy for us

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:47.200
to look back at the disasters
the Comet faced in the early 1950s

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.960
and say, "We can see what was wrong.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.800
"It had oblong windows
with square edges

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.320
"instead of circular windows
or oval windows.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.720
"Of course, these would break up
and there would be metal fatigue."

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.160
Well, what did people know?
They didn't know that.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:05.200
We can be clever now but remember,
the Comet was brand-new.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.040
It was a new type of aircraft.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.680
A very, very high-speed
passenger jet.

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.320
One had never been built before.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:18.360
New metals, new stress skins
on aircraft, this is all new stuff

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.560
and the designers
were entering a new dimension.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.120
Mistakes could be made.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:33.720
More than ever, Britain needed the
turboprop Bristol Britannia
to succeed.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.440
But engine icing problems
and the new,

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.920
more rigorous
Air Ministry safety testing

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:46.720
pushed the plane further
and further behind schedule.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.880
REPORTER: This is called
a drop test.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:59.360
The wheel is spun up
and the whole assembly
is then forced to the ground.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:02.800
In 1957, the Britannia finally
made passenger service,

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:06.320
a full five years
after its promising debut.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.640
REPORTER: Her teething troubles
over,

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:12.720
the long-range Bristol Britannia
goes to work in a big way.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.240
The skipper, Albert Maher, on the
right, and members of his crew,

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:20.360
are ready at London Airport for the
first flight of the new non-stop
London to New York schedule.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.880
The fastest transatlantic
air service in history.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.880
Carrying 52 passengers,

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.760
the "Whispering Giant"
is the first British airliner

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:32.360
in regular commercial service
on the North American route.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:35.960
One of the first to fly
the Britannia was former RAF pilot

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.640
Norman Tebbit, now Lord Tebbit.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.720
Good gracious me!

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.920
It's a long time since I've been
on one of these.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:50.080
Bit bigger than the old 100 series
that I flew.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.280
This is the 300.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.800
I suppose it looks all
very dated now,

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.040
with these old-fashioned
luggage racks.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.560
Of course, this again
is the longer range version

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.040
so they've got a couple of bunks

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:08.400
as they flew longer hauls
across the North Atlantic

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.440
and things of that kind.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.800
And here, onto the flight deck.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.360
Quite a nice navigator's station.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:22.480
You could sit there quite
comfortably, out of everybody's way.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:26.160
Of course, here we've got a hatch,
there.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.560
That's an escape hatch.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:32.800
And here, the hatch for the sextant,
periscopic sextant.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:38.120
Because we navigated an awful lot
in those days by astro.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:41.560
The great thing about the Britannia
was you needed a flight engineer,

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:48.560
fairly heavy, who knew
the location of all the switches

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:52.720
and relays down in the hold,

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.680
underneath the flight deck, here.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:00.040
Because this was before smart,
modern electronics

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:03.760
and everything was still
electromechanical.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:07.800
So if something stuck and didn't
work, got a good engineer,

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.240
he would know which bit
of the flight deck floor

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.640
to jump up and down on
to loosen things up!

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:17.040
And here you are.

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:21.880
I was co-pilot and navigator
on these things

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:25.160
so I would be sitting up here
somewhere.

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.000
Oops. Oh, gosh.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.720
Funny, not so easy to get into these
seats as it was when I was young.

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.760
And a slightly strange
control column here.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:42.720
A funny yoke,
not terribly conventional.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:48.400
Big handful of throttles. This
aeroplane was way ahead of the pack.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:53.120
It was the first really very,
very electrical aeroplane.

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:56.240
That had a downside, of course,
in that if you lost the electrics,

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.640
you were in real big trouble.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:02.680
That's when this switch came in
and basically, it would disconnect

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:06.640
all of the generators
and then reconnect them again

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:10.520
and you should get at least some of
your electrical services back again.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:14.360
Of course, it was known, inevitably,
as the Jesus Christ switch,

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:17.240
because that was the only
occasion when you would use it,

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:21.480
when everybody on the flight deck
was saying, "Jesus Christ!"

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:26.120
You would grab it and hopefully,
all power would be restored.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.160
Very useful!

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:32.000
It seemed that nothing could stop
the long-range turboprop

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.360
Britannia from conquering the
all-important North American market.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:44.480
Could the Union Jack fly high again
over the good old US of A?

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.200
Well, yes, if you believed
Bristol's promotional film

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:50.000
but that was quite a big "if".

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.600
REPORTER: This is the Britannia.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:57.760
The largest, most up-to-date
turboprop airliner in the world.

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:01.080
Mr Peter Masefield, managing
director of Bristol Aircraft Ltd,

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.960
heading a team of executives,
engineers and technicians,

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:07.520
introduced the Britannia
to the major airline bases

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.160
in 14 cities of America

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:15.840
in an unprecedented 24,000 mile tour
of the United States and Canada.

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:21.800
This "Whispering Giant" from England
is a real aeroplane. Yes, sir.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.400
I think the Britannia could have
been a bigger seller

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.720
if it had gone into service earlier

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.880
but partly,
it would have been limited

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:33.320
by Bristol's own capacity
to produce in large numbers.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:38.680
Howard Hughes was interested
in ordering the Britannia for TWA.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:43.400
He actually flew it secretly
one morning on his own,

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:46.720
after meeting Bristol's
test pilots out in America

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:50.560
and came back and said that if he
could have 25 aeroplanes

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:55.720
in 18 months or whatever it was, he
would order it on the spot for TWA.

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:58.240
But Bristol were unable
to commit to producing that

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.320
because they didn't have
the capacity.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:04.240
REPORTER: The tour was now over
and she returned to London airport

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.200
with the assurance that
soon her sister ships in number

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.600
would be following the trail
she successfully blazed

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:14.920
through the skies and across
the oceans, to the New World.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:19.480
Despite the fanfare,
the order books told the story.

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:23.120
In the end,
there were no American orders.

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.240
None.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:30.960
The idea was that you could build
a very successful jet prop plane.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:34.040
Well, that's great, except that the
Americans were thinking,

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.720
"We're going to get across
the Atlantic in seven hours flat

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:40.120
"from London to New York."

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:42.480
And the Bristol Britannia

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:45.600
would kind of stumble its way there
in about 12 hours.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.600
There have been some terrifying
miscalculations.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:51.640
The Britannia was late and when she
did get into service,

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:54.120
for the first year
of her operation,

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.080
only half of the aircraft arrived

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.320
within an hour
of their scheduled time.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.240
There was an all too public squabble

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:02.400
between the BOAC
and the Bristol company.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.200
The real problem was that
the BOAC didn't want it.

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.160
So they kept on badmouthing it.

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:11.600
BOAC actually sort of bigged up
the safety issue

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:16.120
of icing in the engines
long after it had been solved

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:19.080
and they were actually
making this public.

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:22.360
It was extraordinary for an aircraft
they were contracted to buy.

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.120
BOAC didn't want the turboprop
Britannia,

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:31.240
they wanted a pure jet
and an American one.

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:34.920
They'd taken a shine to Boeing 707.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.080
The Americans had joined
the jetliner race.

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:41.560
Britain no longer
had the skies to herself.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.880
What chance do you think we have
of capturing the world market

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:47.200
with this long-range jet?

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.640
The resources of the Americans
are greater.

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.040
Their jet aeroplanes are going to be
backed up by big military contracts

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:58.080
and Boeing have already got a pretty
big tanker contract for the 707.

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.000
But despite that, I still think
we are capable of producing

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.120
an aeroplane as good as they are.

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.600
Why? What compensating
advantage have we?

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.040
Well, there is never any
substitute for brains,

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.040
even though it isn't supported by a
great mass of equipment,

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.320
as it is over there.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.320
We have this experience on the Comet,

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.560
for which, again,
there is no substitute.

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:22.760
And the Comet will clearly become an
aeroplane again and will work again.

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:26.360
De Havilland did indeed rise
to the challenge.

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:28.000
In October 1958,

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.760
the new Comet 4 came into service
to take on the Americans.

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.200
She immediately became
the first pure jet liner

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.560
to cross the Atlantic.

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:43.320
The redesign had thicker
alloy for the fuselage

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:47.360
and the vulnerable square windows
were replaced by oval ones.

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.120
Lord Brabazon, at the public
enquiry into the Comet,

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.720
you said that in every step
in progress,

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.080
we have had to pay for it in blood
and treasure

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:59.720
and God knows that in this case,
we have paid in full.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.480
Do you still feel that way?
I do, indeed.

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:06.240
It was a most expensive
but a very imaginative product

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.800
and we paid for it
but good will come from it,

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:13.240
because on the back
of our experience

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:16.520
and on the back of what was
learned in that enquiry,

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.520
other great machines in the world
have been built

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.360
and are flying today.

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.720
The new Comet was twice as large

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:27.160
and twice as powerful,
with its Rolls-Royce Avon engines.

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:33.000
The Comet had pioneered jet travel
and now defined an age.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.240
And your name? Lord Kimberley.

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:38.880
Are you travelling for business
or for pleasure? Business.

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.440
It's one of the smoothest
flights I've been on.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:45.120
Far less tiring
and really is the tops.

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:48.720
I think it's wonderful
because it's very silent,

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.440
it's very quick and you also get
the most wonderful view.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.720
Were you at all nervous
about taking this flight?

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:57.800
Oh, not at all. Not a bit.
Why should I be?

00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.560
With government encouragement,

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:04.400
BOAC did order 16 of the new
planes and other sales

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:08.640
went to Asia, Africa,
the Middle East and South America.

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.840
The Comet 4 was
the definitive version

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:15.120
of the most adventurous aircraft
in all civil aviation history.

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.520
As the late summers
of the '50s came to an end,

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:34.000
Britain's love affair with aircraft
continued under Hampshire skies.

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:40.360
It seemed that men in sheds could
make the most improbable possible.

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:44.920
And perhaps the most glorious
of these was the Fairey Rotodyne,

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.800
a mongrel mix of autogyro
and turbo jet.

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.720
It can go faster than a helicopter

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:53.920
and slower than
a fixed wing aeroplane.

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:55.480
I think it's one of the most

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.280
brilliant pieces
of advanced engineering

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.960
we've seen for a very long time.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.160
It is a new way of flying.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:06.960
Brilliant idea,
and it was well engineered.

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:10.760
What they hadn't taken into account
was the atrocious noise.

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.080
The jets on the tips of the rotor,

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:16.480
they could stop
a conversation at two miles.

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:19.800
It was intolerable.
There was no way.

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.680
It was a nice idea to have somebody
flying you in from Heathrow

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:26.040
to the South Bank or something,
very convenient for the city,

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:29.240
but it was obviously just not
possible to use the thing,

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:31.640
so it was axed.

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:35.640
The industry, too, was becoming
increasingly mismatched.

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:38.320
The designs were brilliant and many.

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:39.720
The sales were few.

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:45.040
The government needed to step in
to rationalise the business
if it was to succeed.

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:49.600
We were trying to cover
all the different specifications

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:51.520
on the military and civil sides.

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:55.840
There were a large number of British
firms and they were all too small.

00:46:55.840 --> 00:47:00.120
That's one of the reasons
many of the aircraft were delayed.

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:03.440
The teams weren't big enough
to do the job.

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:06.120
In a series of painful
forced marriages,

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:09.800
Rolls-Royce emerged as the leading
engine manufacturer

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:13.640
and the 20 aerospace companies were
whittled down to two main groups,

00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:18.280
Hawker Siddeley and BAC,
the British Aircraft Corporation.

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:23.120
It would be down to BAC to mount
the final British challenge

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.120
to Boeing for the big jet market.

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:43.080
In 1962, a new British star took
to the air - polished, refined,

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.560
with a licence to thrill.

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:48.400
It was Britain's final riposte
to the brash Americans.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:54.120
It was powerful, Savile Row suited,
the name was VC, VC10.

00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:01.200
The VC10 was a magnificent aircraft.
There should be no
question about that.

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:05.960
It looks absolutely superb,
whether you see it
on film or in the ten.

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:11.320
It's a delight. It's a piece of
aviation sculpture. There was
something thrilling in the way it

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:15.320
took off like a jetfighter, rather
than a lumbering Airbus of today.

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:20.680
VC10, romance in the sky,
adventure, Boy's Own, Dan Dare,
the Eagle.

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:23.760
All those things, utterly thrilling.

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:27.400
The VC10 does do a very
different job to the Boeing.

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.920
It's been designed to operate out
of the short airfields with

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:34.320
high temperature conditions which
are so important to large airlines

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:37.360
like the OAC
on the Commonwealth routes.

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:39.480
Why was it necessary
to come into this market?

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:43.720
The big jet market is a great
part of the airline scene

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:46.680
and I think if we are to preserve
the aircraft industry,

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:51.280
which is a great national asset,
it exports perhaps £150 million

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:55.040
per year, we need to develop
an aircraft like the VC10.

00:48:55.040 --> 00:49:00.840
The last of the all-British
great jets has to be the VC10.

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:06.720
And this was a final riposte to the
Americans. They brought us the 707,

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:10.320
which, for decades,
was going to dominate aviation.

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:12.640
We hit back with a plane

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:16.440
which was much more sophisticated
in its design.

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:19.120
The VC10 looked wonderful.

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:22.680
It had its engines at the back,
so the cabin was supremely quiet.

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:23.760
It was fast.

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:27.800
It's still a world record holder
for a subsonic airliner flight.

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:31.520
It was quick, comfortable
and it could go almost anywhere.

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.640
It's astonishing,

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:38.640
but 50 years later, only Concorde
has crossed the Atlantic faster

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.840
than our last great passenger jet.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:46.480
I do this trip from Nairobi
to London every year and this is

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:50.080
by far the most quiet and
most comfortable one I can remember.

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:53.160
The VC10 was deeply loved
by passengers.

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:57.080
That was a great selling point. It's
very seldom you get people coming off

00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:01.080
aircraft saying,
what a wonderful aircraft that was,
but they did on the VC10.

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.200
People would ask to fly on it.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:06.040
They would postpone their flights
if they couldn't.

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:10.120
I think it's an extremely
comfortable plane. Very smooth.

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:15.760
Very quiet. The seating is most
comfortable and plenty of legroom.

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:18.640
It seems to travel so serenely.

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:20.800
When you hit turbulence,

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.160
it doesn't ride turbulence

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:25.080
like other airlines.

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:28.560
It has a very stiff wing,
so it doesn't juggle you about,

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.880
like the average aircraft.

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:34.840
And, of course, the one advantage
the aeroplane always had that made it

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:38.360
so successful was the fact that
the engines were on the tail.

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:41.880
Of course, consequently,
it is a very quiet interior.

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:45.400
Also, for a nervous person who
doesn't really like flying,

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:50.880
it could take off two-thirds quicker
than a 707, so you were 1,000 feet

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:54.920
above the runway
when the 707 was still sitting on it.

00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:00.480
The VC10 was
sold on its passenger experience

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:03.360
and part of this was down
to the cabin crew.

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.600
They also preferred
the aircraft to the 707.

00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.960
When you compared it to the 707,

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:14.800
which I also went on for a short
period, it was the most amazing

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:20.080
aircraft because it was neat,
it was small, it was very fast

00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:24.800
and it is only 144 passengers,
but it was the latest jet plane

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:27.520
that everyone was quite
excited to fly in.

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:31.560
The 707 was much noisier and also
the landing, I always thought

00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:33.720
was a controlled crash all the time.

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.680
Bang! Bang! Down the runway.

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:40.760
The VC10 was very smooth, it glided
off, glided down. It was very smooth.

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:43.680
I think the passengers
preferred the VC10.

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:46.120
The hostesses may have
loved the aircraft,

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:49.800
but were not always
so keen on the designer uniforms.

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.320
Paper dresses were on this route.

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:55.160
I'm sure it was New York
down to the Caribbean.

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.640
You were issued
with this paper dress.

00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:00.760
In New York, even if it was snowing,
you trot onto the aircraft,

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:05.360
we had these big raincoats,
but when you took it off,
you were wearing this paper dress.

00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:08.760
They were more or less all the same
size. They had a string at the back.

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.520
If you had any bust,
it struck straight out in front.

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.960
They had to be two or three
inches above the knee,

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:17.040
you were supposed to wear them.
We were issued with tights.

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:21.520
And all the boys used to
get the scissors out and try
and cut them shorter and shorter.

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:25.640
Green plastic shoes with plastic
jewels on and a flower in your hair.

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:27.200
Hideous. Horrendous.

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.400
And a row of three VC10s and you
don't know which one you were on,

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:35.480
you trot up the steps and say,
"Are you going down the Caribbean?"
all shy and flustered.

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:38.920
And they'd say, "Why?"
You go like this!

00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:43.200
"No, no. It's not this one, dear,
it's that one."

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:51.760
Yet once again, Britain was making
a technically advanced aircraft

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:54.480
to the specifications
of one company.

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:58.880
A company, BOAC,
that was often referred to

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:01.640
as the "Boeing Only
Aircraft Corporation"...

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:06.480
..such was its addiction
to buying the Seattle jet.

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:11.280
No British aircraft could
succeed without the backing

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:16.520
of the state airlines and relying on
that could be a pact with the devil.

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:24.080
The BBC's Money Programme
interviewed Britain's own Dr No,

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:26.400
the chairman of BOAC.

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:30.160
He damned the VC10
with faint praise.

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:34.320
It's a lovely aeroplane to fly,
I've flown it myself.

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:37.560
I think it has one little drawback
and that is that you have to get

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:40.760
an awful lot of extra
people in it before it makes money.

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:45.960
It's a really sad story that the
BOAC, who specified the aeroplane,

00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:48.680
turned against it when they realised

00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:52.560
that the 707 was actually
more economical to fly.

00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:55.480
The reason it was more
economical to fly

00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:59.280
was because the 707 had been
built for very long runways.

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:02.560
The VC10 had been designed
specifically for BOAC's requirement

00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:05.720
to get out of shorter
runways at high altitude

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:09.240
in places like Nairobi
on the Empire routes.

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:12.560
It had a bigger wing,
with high-lift devices,

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:15.160
and the tail-mounted engines.

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:19.800
This made it heavier and
therefore burned a bit more fuel.

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:25.560
So BOAC actually tried to get
out of part of their VC10 order

00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:28.600
in order to buy more 707s,
which didn't really help its image

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:31.960
with the rest of the world
when you were trying to
sell it to other airlines.

00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:36.880
The airline corporations
were more or less strong-armed
into buying British.

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:41.560
They had probably an excessive
influence on the design

00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:46.800
of the aircraft because they
were tailored for their needs

00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:50.960
without looking at
the wider world as a market.

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:53.640
The aircraft were too
closely tailored,

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:57.120
and then inevitably, minds changed,

00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:01.480
commerce developed and the airlines
didn't then really quite want

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:04.000
what they'd said they wanted.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.600
And in the end, airlines tend
to go for operating costs

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:11.360
and reliability, rather than
the last bit of perfection.

00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:17.560
The American 707
went on to sell over 1,000.

00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:21.320
The British VC10, a mere 54.

00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:25.680
A proud line of all British big jets
to challenge the Americans

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:28.440
had come to an end.

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:34.960
And in 1966,
the final sad twist.

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:39.320
The Farnborough airshow, so long the
best of British, went international.

00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:45.000
'For the first time, foreign
aircraft are on show at Farnborough.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.000
'Bristol Siddeley powers four
of them, an Orpheus engine

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.840
'in the Fiat jet trainer
in air force service
with Italy and Germany.'

00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:57.320
The hard truth was that there were
simply not enough British planes

00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:59.000
to fill our top show.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.880
'Rolls-Royce is sponsoring three
overseas aircraft, the Fokker

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:06.880
'Friendship with two Rolls turbo
props is an airliner from Holland.'

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:11.000
A wonderful creative age
was drawing to a close.

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:24.200
For so many years, Farnborough
had been a showcase of British
aviation, civil and military.

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:27.920
The skies were full
of the fastest and highest,

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.720
the most menacing,

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:33.160
and the most adventurous.

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:38.360
There was a great deal of very good
design in Britain at that time,

00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:44.680
but in the end, we just simply
didn't have the capacity, the people,

00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:49.720
the finances, to do all
the things that we were trying.

00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:53.080
Perhaps we were trying
to do too many things

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:56.640
and not really carry
forward enough of them.

00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:01.840
It was so nearly a bloody great era,
but it was screwed up

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:06.680
by lousy management,
hideously missed political decisions

00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:10.720
and also bad specification
on the part of the airlines.

00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:12.680
But what is often overlooked

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:15.880
is that we are still
a major aerospace player.

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:19.680
In fact, we're number one in Europe
and people don't realise that.

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:24.200
We're second only to the
United States in terms of aerospace.

00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:27.880
But there were some wonderful
aircraft. The Comet.

00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:31.120
It should have been the greatest
thing ever. For two years, it was.

00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:33.520
Passengers thought it really was.

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:36.840
The Americans themselves thought it
had left them six years behind.

00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:40.000
Very sad. But wow,
there were some great aircraft!

00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:49.680
For two decades,
we had ruled the skies

00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:53.920
and consistently broken records
with amazing aircraft

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:56.360
that were loved by crew
and passengers alike.

00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:03.800
We had the first turbo-prop plane,
the world-beating Vickers Viscount.

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:10.320
The first jetliner, the sleek silver
De Havilland Comet.

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:17.080
And the VC10,
powerful and athletic

00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:20.680
and still an Atlantic record holder.

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:25.200
In that golden age of invention
and confidence,

00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:28.320
Britain had created
magnificent planes.

00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:34.360
Aircraft that changed the way
that the world would fly forever.

00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:46.960
