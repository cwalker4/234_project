00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.420
- [Interviewer] Alicia, you're out here,

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.930
homeless, Venice Beach.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.783
Tell me about it.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.580
- Yes, I've been out here two years.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.580
Because I paid rent, my whole adult life,

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.010
and never in my wildest dreams,

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.580
would I think that I
would've ended up here,

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.663
pushing a stroller with my animals.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.910
But I did, because I
was in a relationship,

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.000
where I allowed someone to use me.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.963
And when I paid my last
dollar, he left me.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.160
Here I sit, and I sleep, on the street

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.270
that I lived on for 17
years, in an apartment.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.070
Because I, I don't know, I
didn't know where else to go.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.183
It's the worst thing.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.760
I've had a lot of bad things
happen in my lifetime,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.080
but this is really the hardest

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.553
and like, a no way out situation.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.240
It's kinda hopeless, and I
really feel like I'm dead.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.120
Because every day-to-day,
is not, you know, alive.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.220
You just wake up, and
wait for it to be over,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.820
so you can do it all over again.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.053
It's horrible.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.220
- [Interviewer] You were saying

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.350
that you don't know how to be homeless.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.330
- I don't, I either have nothing,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.227
which I've had many a time,

00:01:16.227 --> 00:01:17.950
that only the clothes on my back.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.590
Or too much stuff,
which I just push around

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.410
because I'm so tired to...

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.850
You know, I have a few
things here and there.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.410
I don't know, am I packing for a trip?

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.760
Like I'm going on vacation.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.570
I don't know how to do this.

00:01:31.202 --> 00:01:33.433
And your stuff always gets stolen anyways.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.430
Or the city, every Friday,

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.120
they handcuff you and take your stuff,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.850
if you don't get out of their way.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.683
- [Interviewer] They handcuff you?

00:01:41.683 --> 00:01:42.611
- Yeah, they take everything--

00:01:42.611 --> 00:01:43.444
- [Interviewer] Or if
they don't get out of--

00:01:43.444 --> 00:01:45.120
- They don't always handcuff
you, but I've been handcuffed,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.670
and they took everything I had.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.300
That's their cleanup, they
clean up, every Friday morning.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.850
- [Interviewer] Right.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.280
- Then when it rains,

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.400
that's the only time they
really come and torture you.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.439
Because when you're trying to stay dry,

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.140
(chuckling) they don't allow that.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.150
So, you're either
invisible, or an eyesore.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.130
Everybody just wants you to go.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.230
Or they don't see you.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.760
Say they're handing out
stuff, you might be there,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.517
but they're not handing out
anything to you (laughing).

00:02:11.517 --> 00:02:15.280
You know, like the free
drinks and stuff, or whatever.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.010
Wherever you go, or nobody sees you.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.810
You say hello, and no one sees you.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.112
- [Interviewer] How do
you survive out here?

00:02:21.112 --> 00:02:24.710
- I don't (sighing), I
don't know, it's hard.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.910
You have to, you know,

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.700
it's just the whole day is about that.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.430
Getting through the
day, whatever you need.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.430
As far as food, and
stuff, you just have to,

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.140
if you've used up any
resources that you might have,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.390
then you have to just look for it.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.170
And it's, there's so many people out here,

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.830
it's hard to come by.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.390
Even though thousands of people
come here, it's not easy.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.110
Last year, even in a year's time,

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.900
it was easier last year, than it is now.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.260
Now, everyone's looking
for the same thing.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.610
- [Interviewer]
Homelessness getting worse?

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.710
- Yes, oh, absolutely.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.880
- [Interviewer] It breaks my
heart that you're sleeping

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.090
on the same street, that.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.460
When I was homeless,

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.550
I actually went to where I
felt the most comfortable,

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.780
which is where I used to live.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.750
Same thing.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.260
- I lived right down the street.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.913
The beach, which was my
heaven, is now kinda my hell.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.483
It really is.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.143
As grateful as I am to be
here, and not Skid Row,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.767
it's still, it really is hell (chuckling).

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.023
I have a 16 year-old cat,
and a nine year-old dog.

00:03:31.663 --> 00:03:32.496
- [Interviewer] It's your life?

00:03:32.496 --> 00:03:33.810
It would be a lot easier
if it was just me,

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.780
but they actually, they're a blessing,

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.883
because without them, I
don't know how I would do it.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.000
- [Interviewer] What was your
first night, homeless, like?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.820
- Oh hell, well last year,

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.550
I cried all day and all night, everyday.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.150
That's why they call me crybaby.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.343
It was awful, I rode back to my old house.

00:03:55.566 --> 00:03:56.399
I didn't know what to do.

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:57.860
And then you can't go to sleep,

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.143
Because I was scared to go to sleep.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.460
I didn't actually sleep,
until this one guy,

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.540
who kind of befriended me, sort of,

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.440
he recycled, and he'd let me
sleep, while he stayed awake.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.540
So, you know, there's that.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.050
But I used to not even have a tent,

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.520
so I would just lay there.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.800
You'd always have to have one eye open.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.780
I couldn't just totally go to sleep.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.120
- [Interviewer] What would you want people

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.020
to know about homelessness,
that they probably don't know?

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.410
- That (sighing) there
are many different reasons

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.050
why people are out here,

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.653
but, we're still human beings.

00:04:36.535 --> 00:04:38.410
They don't even have to...

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.730
It's not about because I want them

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.200
to give me something, or anything,

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.310
but even sometimes, just to acknowledge,

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.470
you know, if you're passing,
or even just a smile.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.690
Don't even have to do that.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.090
But know that everybody,
it's not just one group,

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.160
and it's a complex problem to solve.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.710
I don't know what the answer is,

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.923
but just having people go
away, isn't the solution.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.321
It's not.

00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:04.340
And if they only knew how awful it is,

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.530
because you're really persecuted.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.480
People automatically,
that when I was first,

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.130
the very first night, I was
hated because I was homeless.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.610
And I thought, well, yesterday

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.127
I was like you guys (laughing).

00:05:19.457 --> 00:05:21.760
Just, I guess, to be more compassionate.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.140
And there are very, there are
kind people, and blessings.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.180
I do notice them, but it's so
overshadowed most of the time

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.593
by all the negativity, and it's hard.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.190
You can't be anywhere, you can't rest,

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.280
you can't do anything.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.210
They just want you to go.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.500
Go over there, you're blocking a sidewalk.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.640
And I physically, I'm 54 years old.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.413
I can't, it's too much on me.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.860
It's hard, it's taking a toll.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.940
Now, I'm just so exhausted,
I could barely even...

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.983
I used to leave everyday,
and now I can barely do that.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.840
- [Interviewer] You were saying

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.840
if people just spent two
days out here, they'd change.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.240
- I think they would see
it a lot differently,

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.440
or at least have a
little bit of compassion.

00:06:11.736 --> 00:06:15.330
Or maybe help think of a solution,

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.500
rather than just disappear.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.570
Because it's just, it's unbearable.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:22.780
For me, anyways.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.260
There are people, and
they're mostly younger,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.980
it's a party, their in
their twenties, or younger.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.810
- [Interviewer] But that's
always been Venice culture.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.620
- Yes, and you know, and passing through.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.670
But there's a lot of mix in between too,

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.360
and there's even people with children.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.033
There's a few that have a baby.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.020
But now I know, if I had the opportunity

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.640
to have like a Section 8,

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.430
or whatever, just for
starters, I could pull it off.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.810
I could totally be a success story.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.280
'Cause I always paid rent, no matter what.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.880
- [Interviewer] But you
need somebody to offer you

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.090
the housing, in the Section 8.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.090
- Yeah, the opportunity.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.300
- [Interviewer] The wait list in--

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.180
- It's years, and you know,
yeah, so there is there.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.920
And I don't know that I can stay out here.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.970
I feel like, I never
believed in killing myself,

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.770
but I (sighing) I've thinked
about it all the time.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.500
Because it's just, it's unbearable.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.570
Waking up every day, and it's
like the walk to nowhere.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.490
You're just killing time.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.323
That's it.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.590
That's one of the hardest parts,

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.503
besides moving your stuff
back and forth, all the time,

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.000
is the walk to nowhere, for me, anyways.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.730
- [Interviewer] The walk to nowhere.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:37.563
- Yep (sobbing).

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.178
- [Interviewer] If you had three
wishes, what would they be?

00:07:40.178 --> 00:07:41.011
(sobbing)

00:07:41.011 --> 00:07:41.844
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.593
- Oh, I don't know.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.200
I'd probably (sobbing) wish
something for my daughter,

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.495
instead of myself.

00:07:52.495 --> 00:07:54.270
(dog barking)

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.740
I don't know.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:56.730
Well one of them definitely,

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.020
is to not be homeless (laughing),

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.370
so I can have my life back,

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:07.293
while I still have time, and
try and correct these things.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.713
The other two wishes,

00:08:09.713 --> 00:08:11.527
I'd have to get back to
you on that (laughing).

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.843
But yeah, to get out of this
situation, while I still can.

00:08:17.886 --> 00:08:19.943
- [Interviewer] And people
need to help you do that.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.760
- Yeah, like I said, I don't
know what the solution is,

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.080
because the shelter,
nobody wants a shelter

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.540
in their neighborhood, that kind of thing.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.490
And I don't wanna go
to the shelter anyways.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:32.730
I just need an opportunity.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:33.910
There's a building right over there

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:35.363
that's a Section 8 building.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:40.500
Because I only have $220 cash, a month,

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.330
but I could do it, no problem.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.650
And then you know, and then
go back to work, and so forth.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.880
- [Interviewer] So if there
was a path out of homelessness,

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.080
you'd take it?

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.160
- Yes, I would.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.110
If I had an opportunity
like that, yeah, I would.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.700
But I don't wanna go to
like some city far away,

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.480
to a shelter or where, whatever.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.930
I have animals and you
gotta leave everyday,

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:05.710
what's the point in that?

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:06.750
And that's like a wish.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:10.590
That I wish I had that
opportunity to just have the path,

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.380
you know and, I don't know,

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.830
or had a housing opportunity.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.800
But there's not enough of them.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.830
So we'll see what happens.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.000
Meanwhile, though, there's
no place of storage.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.180
If you could store your
stuff, that would take a load,

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.203
that could change a lot of
things, too, for people.

00:09:27.203 --> 00:09:28.920
(coughing)
It's hard to push around

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.713
all your belongings, everyday.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.480
- [Interviewer] Thank you
very much for talking to me.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.859
- Oh, you're welcome, thank you.

00:09:37.859 --> 00:09:39.073
Thank you for hearing me.

00:09:40.338 --> 00:09:42.921
(mellow music)
