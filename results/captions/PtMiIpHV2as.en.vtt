00:00:02.368 --> 00:00:03.869
President Trump
has once again falsely accused

00:00:03.869 --> 00:00:06.506
the FBI of spying on him,
but it turns out

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:09.975
there was one person who really
did secretly tape Trump --

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:11.344
his own lawyer.

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:13.880
For more on this,
it's time for "A Closer Look."

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.017
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:20.819
-The President is facing
an intense political backlash

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:23.656
over his press conference
last week with Vladimir Putin.

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:26.559
His administration still has
thousands of migrant children

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.828
jailed and separated
from their parents,

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:31.130
and his personal fixer,
Michael Cohen,

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.433
might be cooperating
with federal Investigators.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:36.368
So, naturally, Trump has decided
the appropriate response

00:00:36.368 --> 00:00:39.205
is to threaten a war with Iran.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.174
-President Trump is once again

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:44.643
threatening the annihilation of
a country very late last night.

00:00:44.643 --> 00:00:47.213
Trump tweeted out,
in all capitals,

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.315
"To Iranian President Rouhani --

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:51.751
never, ever threaten
the United States again,

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:54.721
or you will suffer consequences
the likes of which

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.490
few throughout history
have ever suffered before.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.425
We are no longer a country
that will stand

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:02.395
for your demented words
of violence and death.

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:03.729
Be cautious!"

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.966
-Wow. You can take
the crazy old man out of Queens,

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.536
but you can't make him
stop yelling at foreigners.

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:11.271
[ Laughter ]

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:15.541
Also -- also -- you don't
get to say "Be cautious"

00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:17.410
when you're tweeting
in all caps.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.611
[ Laughter ]

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.180
That's like a British person

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.947
screaming at
the top of their lungs,

00:01:21.947 --> 00:01:23.949
"Keep calm and carry on!"

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:25.984
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:01:25.984 --> 00:01:28.121
"We're all gonna die!"

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:31.057
[ Laughter ]

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:32.591
Trump's threat of war
against Iran

00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:34.126
was just the latest in a series

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:36.062
of unhinged comments
over the weekend.

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:37.630
Since the start
of his presidency,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.466
Trump has also nursed
the paranoid fantasy

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:43.068
that the FBI and the Democrats
were spying on him.

00:01:43.068 --> 00:01:45.105
Over the weekend, he tweeted...

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.714
I think my favorite part
of that one

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:57.016
is "surveillance" in
parentheses.

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:59.419
Like, in case you didn't know
what "spied upon" means,

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.554
here's a longer word for it.

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:03.256
[ Laughter ]

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:06.426
Surveillance must have been on
his Word of the Year calendar.

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:08.861
[ Laughter ]

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:12.198
"Surveillance --
Oh, spied upon.

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:14.601
See you next January, words."

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:17.236
[ Laughter ]

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:20.572
Trump's latest outburst came
after the Justice Department

00:02:20.572 --> 00:02:23.343
released a redacted version
of the application

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:26.212
they filed to surveil
a Trump campaign adviser

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:28.014
named Carter Page.

00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:30.283
There he is.
God bless him.

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:33.286
That's how your dog looks at you
when he's torn a pillow apart

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:35.254
and you haven't
started yelling at him yet.

00:02:35.254 --> 00:02:36.789
[ Laughter ]

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:38.324
"I took care
of that pillow for you!

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:39.492
I did good, right?"

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.193
[ Laughter ]

00:02:41.193 --> 00:02:44.130
The FBI believe that Page
has been collaborating

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.665
and conspiring
with the Russian government.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:48.000
On Sunday, Page went on the TV
to defend himself

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.135
but would not answer
the simple question

00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:53.239
of whether he had relationships
with Russian officials.

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.340
-You have relationships

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.142
with Russian government
officials, right?

00:02:56.142 --> 00:02:59.579
-Well, let's see what they're
referring to, specifically.

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.180
-But, Carter, Carter,
you didn't answer --

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.348
You have relationships
with Russian

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:04.316
government officials, true?
Yes?

00:03:04.316 --> 00:03:06.252
-Well, let's see
what they're talking about.

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:07.720
You know, I talked
with a few --

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.188
-I'm just asking you -- I'm just
asking you a straight question.

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:11.224
Do you have relationships with
Russian government officials?

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:12.625
I can tell you I don't.

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:14.661
-Oh!
[ Laughter ]

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:17.931
Oh, you don't, Jake Tapper?

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:20.033
You think Wolf Blitzer
is his real name?

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.033
[ Laughter ]

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:22.267
Beard, glasses?

00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:24.970
That's obviously Vladimir Putin
in a disguise.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.473
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:31.110
Page --
[ [ Laughter and applause ]

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.279
Smilin' Carter Page
was then asked if he had ever

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:37.283
served as an informal adviser
to the Kremlin,

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:40.620
a charge he denied
despite some powerful evidence.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.755
-Did you ever
advise the Kremlin

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:45.424
or work with the Kremlin
on anything?

00:03:45.424 --> 00:03:48.061
-Look, Jake, I, uh -- no.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.462
-But you did advise the Kremlin.

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:51.197
I mean,
I just want to make it clear.

00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:54.600
You did advise the Kremlin
back in 2013 or 2012,

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.069
somewhere in there?

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.937
-Jake, that's --
It's really spin.

00:03:57.937 --> 00:04:01.140
I mean,
I sat in on some meetings,

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.376
but, you know,
to call me an adviser, I think,

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:06.044
is way over the --
over the top.

00:04:06.044 --> 00:04:09.816
-Except, in a 2013 letter,
you wrote, it says,

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:12.685
"Over the past half year,
I have had the privilege

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:15.421
to serve as an informal adviser
to the staff of the Kremlin

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.489
in preparation for the
presidency of the G20 summit

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.058
next month, where energy issues

00:04:19.058 --> 00:04:20.559
will be a prominent point
on the agenda."

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:21.928
That's August 2013.

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.263
That's yourself calling yourself

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.932
an informal adviser
to the Kremlin.

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:29.334
-You know, informal, having some
conversations with people.

00:04:29.334 --> 00:04:34.373
-I have never seen anyone
so happy about a losing hand.

00:04:34.373 --> 00:04:35.508
[ Laughter ]

00:04:35.508 --> 00:04:37.043
"I have a full house, Carter."

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:39.879
"Well, I have a MetroCard
and a CVS receipt."

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:46.519
[ Laughter ]

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:49.622
But Trump's obsession with being
secretly taped is not new.

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.957
It's something he's been fixated
on throughout his presidency,

00:04:51.957 --> 00:04:54.527
like when he falsely accused
President Obama

00:04:54.527 --> 00:04:56.562
of having his wires tapped
or when he tweeted...

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:03.936
It's almost like he got
secretly taped at some point,

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:05.872
and waiting for
that tape to come out

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:08.340
is slowly driving him insane.
[ Laughter ]

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.175
And he tries not
to think about that tape,

00:05:10.175 --> 00:05:11.744
but for whatever reason,
every time he pees,

00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:14.747
he can't get it out of his mind.
[ Laughter ]

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:18.050
And even Trump's explanations
for his bizarre comments

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.886
about secret tapes
are themselves incriminating.

00:05:20.886 --> 00:05:23.088
Like when he was asked
about his Comey tweet

00:05:23.088 --> 00:05:26.225
and rambled like he was under
police interrogation.

00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:29.127
-Why did you want him to believe
that you possibly did that?

00:05:29.127 --> 00:05:31.063
-Well, I didn't tape him.

00:05:31.063 --> 00:05:32.998
You never know what's happening
when you see that

00:05:32.998 --> 00:05:35.868
the Obama administration,
and perhaps longer than that,

00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:39.472
was doing all of this unmasking
and surveillance

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:40.940
that you read all about it.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.208
And I've been reading about it
for the last couple of months

00:05:43.208 --> 00:05:45.577
about the seriousness of the --

00:05:45.577 --> 00:05:49.315
and horrible situation with
surveillance all over the place.

00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:51.150
So you never know
what's out there,

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.719
but I didn't tape,
and I don't have any tape,

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:54.954
and I didn't tape.

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:58.925
-He's like the bus
from the movie "Speed."

00:05:58.925 --> 00:05:59.992
[ Laughter ]

00:05:59.992 --> 00:06:02.595
He can't stop talking,
or he'll explode.

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:04.029
[ Laughter ]

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:05.865
Trump's paranoia
about being secretly taped

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:08.300
doesn't just 'cause him to
accuse others of spying on him,

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.036
he has also repeatedly insisted,
without any prompting,

00:06:11.036 --> 00:06:13.372
that there are
no secret recordings

00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:15.675
proving that his team
colluded with Russia.

00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:17.710
Like when he tweeted,
out of nowhere...

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:24.450
Or when the pee tape allegations
first surfaced in 2017,

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.153
Trump insisted he was always
careful when he traveled abroad

00:06:28.153 --> 00:06:31.423
because he was always afraid
he was being recorded.

00:06:31.423 --> 00:06:33.458
-I'm surrounded by bodyguards.

00:06:33.458 --> 00:06:35.494
I'm surrounded by people,

00:06:35.494 --> 00:06:37.663
and I always tell them --
anywhere --

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:41.334
but I always tell them,
if I'm leaving this country,

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:45.605
"Be very careful,
because in your hotel rooms,

00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:46.773
and no matter where you go,

00:06:46.773 --> 00:06:48.307
you're gonna probably
have cameras."

00:06:48.307 --> 00:06:50.409
I'm not referring
just to Russia,

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:52.711
but I would certainly
put them in that category.

00:06:52.711 --> 00:06:56.181
But in those rooms, you have
cameras in the strangest places.

00:06:56.181 --> 00:06:59.751
Cameras that are so small,
with modern technology,

00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:02.755
you can't see them,
and you won't know.

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:04.490
"You better be careful,

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:09.061
or you'll be watching yourself
on nightly television."

00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:11.597
-Okay, so...
[ Laughter ]

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:13.266
So, hold on.
So, hold on.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.601
Just --
Just a tip.

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:19.238
If someone asks you, "Did you
pee on a bed with hookers?"

00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:21.307
the right answer is,
"No, that's disgusting.

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:24.510
I'm married," not, "No,
there are cameras everywhere."

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.581
[ Laughter ]

00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:31.150
So, Trump is obsessed
with being secretly taped,

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.853
but it turns out,
it wasn't Russia or the FBI

00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:35.187
he should've been worried about.

00:07:35.187 --> 00:07:36.889
It was his own lawyer.

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:38.690
-The "New York Times"
is just reporting

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.460
that Michael Cohen
secretly recorded a conversation

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.429
that he had with Donald Trump

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:46.331
just two months before
the presidential election

00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:49.334
and that the two men,
in this phone conversation,

00:07:49.334 --> 00:07:52.871
discussed payments
to a former "Playboy" model

00:07:52.871 --> 00:07:55.841
who said that she had an affair
with Donald Trump.

00:07:55.841 --> 00:07:57.743
-So Trump has spent
his entire presidency

00:07:57.743 --> 00:07:59.511
obsessed with being
secretly recorded,

00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:00.780
and it turns out
the only one

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.315
who secretly recorded him
was his own lawyer.

00:08:03.315 --> 00:08:07.019
Everyone from his past
is coming back to haunt him.

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:09.020
If he ever goes on trial,
it's gonna look like

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.090
the "Seinfeld" finale.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.427
But instead of the Soup Nazi,
they'll be actual Nazis.

00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:15.661
[ Laughter ]

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:17.396
So now there's
a secret recording

00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:20.065
that directly implicates Trump
in a scheme to pay hush money

00:08:20.065 --> 00:08:23.301
to silence a "Playboy" model
and possibly even implicates him

00:08:23.301 --> 00:08:25.737
in campaign-finance violations
and bank fraud,

00:08:25.737 --> 00:08:27.473
and it was made
by his own lawyer.

00:08:27.473 --> 00:08:29.275
Now, you might
feel bad for Donald Trump

00:08:29.275 --> 00:08:30.609
that his lawyer
secretly taped him,

00:08:30.609 --> 00:08:34.747
but that's what you get
when you hire a terrible lawyer.

00:08:34.747 --> 00:08:36.748
"Remember, this is all
hush-hush, Michael."

00:08:36.748 --> 00:08:38.551
"Oh, I remember,
because when you said

00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:40.619
it was hush-hush, I taped it,
and then played it back

00:08:40.619 --> 00:08:42.021
to make sure I heard you right.

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:44.256
And then I put that tape
in a box that said

00:08:44.256 --> 00:08:46.692
'Hey, FBI, these tapes
are none of your beeswax!'"

00:08:46.692 --> 00:08:49.361
[ Laughter ]

00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:50.896
But this explains why Trump
is so scared

00:08:50.896 --> 00:08:52.364
of being secretly recorded.

00:08:52.364 --> 00:08:55.767
Whenever there is a transcript,
a recording of a secret meeting,

00:08:55.767 --> 00:08:57.536
or phone call
he or his team had,

00:08:57.536 --> 00:08:59.638
we find out they
did something incriminating.

00:08:59.638 --> 00:09:02.040
It also explains why
the people closest to Trump

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.077
have repeatedly tried to set up
secret back channels to Russia

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:07.079
or why he wanted
to meet privately with Putin

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:08.914
without aides
or why he wouldn't even

00:09:08.914 --> 00:09:10.950
tell his own intelligence heads
about his plan

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.585
to invite Putin
to the White House,

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:15.854
which resulted in this amazing
clip last week of Dan Coats,

00:09:15.854 --> 00:09:17.623
the Director
of National Intelligence,

00:09:17.623 --> 00:09:22.128
finding out about the invitation
onstage from Andrea Mitchell.

00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:23.396
-We have some breaking news.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:25.631
The White House
has announced on Twitter

00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:30.235
that Vladimir Putin is coming to
the White House in the fall.

00:09:30.235 --> 00:09:36.676
-Say that again.
[ Laughter ]

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:38.076
-Vladimir Putin coming to the --

00:09:38.076 --> 00:09:41.480
-Did I hear you?
-Yeah, yeah.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.715
-Okay.
-Yeah.

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:46.718
[ Laughter ]

00:09:46.718 --> 00:09:48.220
-That's gonna be special.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.522
[ Laughter ]

00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:52.591
-That's the Director
of National Intelligence,

00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:54.626
which makes sense because,
under Trump,

00:09:54.626 --> 00:09:55.894
our national intelligence

00:09:55.894 --> 00:09:57.830
has basically devolved to,
"Say what?"

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:58.964
[ Laughter ]

00:09:58.964 --> 00:10:00.532
Trump has spent
his entire presidency

00:10:00.532 --> 00:10:02.735
doing everything possible
to evade both public oversight

00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:04.737
of his actions and his own
intelligence agencies,

00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:07.539
and now it turns out
it was his own lawyer

00:10:07.539 --> 00:10:09.108
who secretly recorded him.

00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:12.244
And I can't wait for that tape
to be played in court because...

00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:13.445
-That's gonna be special.

00:10:13.445 --> 00:10:15.547
-This has been "A Closer Look."

00:10:15.547 --> 00:10:19.251
[ Cheers and applause ]
