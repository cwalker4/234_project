00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.179
the Florida Everglades are
internationally famous for alligators

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:16.859
but now there's a new king the Burmese
python these snakes are devastating our

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.220
native wildlife
99% of the fur bearing wildlife are gone

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.480
doing nothing is not an option
oh shoot right there right there and now

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.529
I've made it my mission to take out
these invaders Hey

00:00:45.780 --> 00:01:05.230
got it holy what's all about right here

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:13.020
my name is trapper Mike I'm known as the
Python cowboy I sleep out in the Florida

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.850
Everglades now I hunt big-ass snake

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:27.110
so I just got a call from Miccosukee
Indian I know and I guess word around

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:35.090
town is this area in the Everglades is
totally ran over by snakes so much so

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.970
that the local Miccosukee are scared to
go in the area they kind of they kind of

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.490
treat it like the snakes of curse so
they said that the area's slapped full

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.490
of snakes and not only that but there's
a monster out there so we're gonna go

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.970
and get it

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.560
so when you're looking for pythons the
main thing you're looking for is their

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.609
pattern it stands out from everything
else there's nothing down here that

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:24.519
looks like the Python they got a shine
to it they got a real beautiful exotic

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.680
look and it stands out you know weather
is just a piece of the snake is showing

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.640
or what you look for that little bit of
shine you look for that little bit of

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.480
pattern and you know while while we're
talking right now if something were to

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.790
happen because people you know people
kind of take it as a joke sometimes but

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.319
there's real shit out here you know it's
it's really no joke these these snakes

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.689
can kill you an alligator can kill you a
lot can go wrong I have a Glock up here

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:03.280
on the dash it's loaded ready to go just
bring that down don't freak out put the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.189
gun directly to the animal's head try
not to shoot me and and double tap it if

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:14.439
you have to but it's important you know
for you to know that yeah all right good

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:18.299
I'm counting on you right yep

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:41.459
you know we should be seeing raccoons we
should be seeing possums otters we but

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.280
should be seeing a lot more birds hogs
here even and you know as you see

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.300
there's nothing out here
everything's gone it's all been turned

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:58.860
into snake shit basically and it's just
it's sad to see you know it's all it I

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.019
love our native wildlife our native
wildlife is a big part of how I make my

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:10.860
living and it's just you know it's
terrible and that's why you know that's

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.250
kind of why I've gotten involved with it
it's just you know I can't I can't sit

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.470
around while this invasive species
totally wipes out all all of my native

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:29.639
wildlife oh shit right there right there

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.390
see you come up here

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.210
he's here

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.410
these animals are so tough that I'm
forced to go hands-on with them

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.959
little guy

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:07.059
this is on the smaller size of what we
normally catch a beautiful snake looks

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:15.020
like it probably just said recently this
is probably about

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.720
a little over six foot they're so tough
and and their brain is actually so small

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.490
and you have to hit it directly to even
phase them guns just isn't an option I

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:31.310
catch them all alive with my bare hands
and that's the most secure way to get

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:38.889
them out of the Everglades and out of
our ecosystem

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:47.520
that's it as soon as I got I'm like that
it's over let's go get the next one

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.430
yes these reptiles they can lay a
hundred eggs at a time out a year and

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.170
you know once a year that that's a lot
there's a lot of snakes out here and

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:03.810
they're multiplying at an incredible
rate at this point it's not an

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:09.720
elimination effort it's it's just not
possible it's a control and management

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.830
effort we're stopping the spread from
spreading to other parts of Florida and

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:19.320
we're managing the current population of
pythons you know it's a real serious

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:28.730
situation and it's as far as I'm
concerned it's a state of emergency

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:35.240
so onto the way to this spot we're going
there's a real cool abandoned facility

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:41.240
it was used her in the Cold War in the
effort to get to space it was actually

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.650
think the company was called an aero jet
and it's a little spooky out there

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.460
there's a lot of snakes out there and I
think it'd be a real cool area for us to

00:06:49.460 --> 00:07:02.450
check out we're here driving back in the
restricted area and we see this someone

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:13.280
took a lot of time to neatly make an
arrow out of rocks pointing down that

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:21.140
road there which just so happens to be
the road that we're going down so I'm

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:29.210
gonna scan take a look with my thermal
monocular and see if there's anybody out

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:35.060
there what the hell's going on
I found dead dogs out here too fresh off

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.870
a dogfight

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:46.400
I found dump cars that were in a crime
in this area specifically is notorious

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.320
for gang crime and different things like
that so it's just a little spooky that

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.830
we see this here but we're gonna keep
going and hopefully everything will be

00:07:54.830 --> 00:08:02.810
all right this is the start of the
buildings here here yet these are used

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.990
for

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:09.270
rocket shit I guess

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.050
it's all about checking out check this
first one

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:23.030
pythons like it in there it's a nice
warm climate gets them out the get some

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.449
outside

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.210
yeah

00:08:54.329 --> 00:09:01.499
girl told you we fly one here so when
you capture these things you know it's

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:05.069
you got to be ready to battle
it'll they'll lay there they're not

00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:08.759
scared of you they're not going to move
unless you know they have a real reason

00:09:08.759 --> 00:09:13.110
to and they're on the top of the food
chain there's no other predator out

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.309
there for them

00:09:19.459 --> 00:09:22.579
as soon as I put my hand on a minute it
is go time

00:09:22.579 --> 00:09:27.559
they they they're gonna fight they come
right back try to strike at me but when

00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:34.590
I dodge their strikes they'll start
curling up on my arm

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:40.880
when they do that they spray musk and
poop all over me it'll leave me sneaking

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:47.000
out here in the glades for few days
yeah and yeah it's it's a real battle

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.260
it's like WWF and the swamp you know
what I mean it's especially when you get

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:58.850
a big one you get a 13 14 18 foot snake
it's it's no joke if you're out here by

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:04.180
yourself and it gets around your neck at
that that could be it

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:10.690
this is what's eating our Everglades do
you know of our native wildlife

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:18.660
beautiful snake that was great we caught
that snake it uh kind of sucks it wasn't

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:24.030
that big but uh you know a Python out
the Everglades it's good no matter what

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:28.070
let's see what else we can go get
tonight

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:42.220
we're getting real close to to the place
we want to be at we got one more gate to

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.850
get through up here

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:55.010
I think this this guy that called me he
might be onto some of them here it's

00:10:55.010 --> 00:11:02.280
kind of looking even more sneaky as we
get there

00:11:03.459 --> 00:11:10.129
so we're coming up in the area now
they're doing a bunch of construction

00:11:10.129 --> 00:11:13.089
out here on the levy out here never
glades

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:19.509
it's all you know Water Management and
given access to different areas

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.980
since they've been seen a lot of snakes
out here a real big one

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:30.630
yeah look they're piling up all this
limestone gravel out here they digged us

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:36.090
up to build canals little reservoirs and
things like that and they pile it up

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:42.720
here I guess don't even look like there
is a swamp here man changes everything I

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:48.990
think I might want to get down and walk
around a little bit here yeah let's do

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:53.430
that

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.509
it's a good one it's a good one man

00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:38.329
get ready shit go south you got my back
yeah I don't know if this is the wine

00:12:38.329 --> 00:12:46.000
but it's a good-looking
this ain't no small one

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:56.180
come on

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:33.920
got it yes sir holy what people so
what's all about right here

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:40.170
this thing right here to get this big I
don't even want to think about how many

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:45.269
ambulances here this right here is the
problem this right here is why

00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:53.310
everything's get out of the Everglades
look at the size of this is that least a

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.209
16-foot snake

00:13:58.939 --> 00:14:06.569
damn missing string believe it or not
this animal this snakes actually really

00:14:06.569 --> 00:14:17.250
skinny it should be twice as big as this
big around it almost looks like yeah

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:22.110
it's a female
this snake just came off the nest what

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:27.149
they do is they'll a nest and they'll
sit on it until the eggs hatch and as

00:14:27.149 --> 00:14:32.100
soon as the eggs hatch they leave the
nest and they go search for their first

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:40.130
meal I got her before she got her first
meal thank God whew

00:14:45.939 --> 00:14:59.300
one more out the glades you big - so
what's all about boys right here things

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:03.550
easily over a hundred pounds easily

00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:28.399

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:42.499
got it we got a couple good snakes we
got the big one we came for I'm really

00:15:42.499 --> 00:15:46.519
glad I followed up on this and we came
out here but this is my home you know

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:52.069
this is how I make my living I make my
living off of wildlife and and I was

00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:56.689
born and raised in it and it's you guys
wouldn't believe with driving four

00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:59.809
nights in that truck staring at the
ground in the middle of the swamp will

00:15:59.809 --> 00:16:04.759
do to you getting eaten up by mosquitoes
and it will drive you frickin crazy man

00:16:04.759 --> 00:16:08.689
so you know it's it's something you got
to love it's something you got to have a

00:16:08.689 --> 00:16:14.420
real personal mission for me that's
that's saving the Everglades I think we

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:19.129
should call it a night maybe after that
one there but the leg bleed could

00:16:19.129 --> 00:16:27.880
dripping wet ain't no joke wrestling one
that big I'm telling you right now
