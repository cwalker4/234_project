00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.640
With over 4,400 votes casted on our poll a
couple of weeks ago, you guys have decided

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.200
who the top ten Jedi that survived Order 66
are based on their popularity among the fanbase.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.100
Also a heads up there will be major spoilers
for The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels TV

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.460
shows, as well as the Republic comic series.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.619
At number 10, with 102 votes, is A'Sharad
Hett.

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.720
Having a far more unique introduction of the
Jedi Order than most, A’Shared Hett originally

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.950
spent much of his childhood and teenage years
within the Tuskan tribes of Tatooine.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.401
His father was once a Jedi Knight who exiled
himself to the deserts of Tatooine, eventually

00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:48.190
taking over the Tuskan tribes as he believed
it was his responsibility to both lead them

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.030
for their own survival, while also minimising
the harm they did to the local inhabitants

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.550
of the desert planet.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.640
As a result, Hett was raised with both Jedi
and Tuskan tribe traditions, later becoming

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.280
an apprentice of his father who taught him
the ways of the force.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.970
Hett’s formal inclusion to the Jedi Order
happened following the death of his father

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.620
and the destruction of his Tuskan tribe during
a conflict that involved the Hutt clans.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.890
He was originally taken in as Kai-Adi-Mundi’s
apprentice, but later was transferred to the

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.860
Dark Woman who believed she was a better fit
to the unique padawan.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.550
Despite now being within the Jedi Order, Hett
still remained clothed in traditional Tuskan

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.210
masks and coverings.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.830
While for the most part he fit in within the
Jedi quite easily, he did have a special relationship

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.690
with Anakin Skywalker.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.330
Both him and Anakin were brought to the Order
around the same time, and because of this

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.310
Hett was one of the very few people young
Anakin could relate to during his early years

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.510
within the Temple.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.480
However, due to the missions Hett was called
upon, the two natives of Tatooine barely saw

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.930
each other up until the start of the Clone
Wars.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.280
Like most Jedi around his age and rank, the
now Knighted Hett was made into a General

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.560
during the clone wars.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.159
He was eventually assigned a mission alongside
a far different Anakin from the one he once

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.780
knew as a kid.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.780
During this mission he learned of the Chosen
One’s slaughter of a Tusken village out

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.530
of a fit of rage.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.940
Hoping to ease his unsettled comrade’s emotions,
Hett for the first time removed his Tuskan

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.920
coverings to reveal his Human appearance,
to show Anakin that he was a Human just like

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.580
him despite his savage heritage.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.030
From then on he would remain without his Tuskan
coverings.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.970
When Order 66 was issued, Hett was involved
in the Siege of Saleucami.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.730
After cutting down the clone troopers that
were assigned to execute him, Hett believed

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.920
he was among the only survivors of the Jedi
Order.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.090
Having no where else to turn to, he returned
home to Tatooine to reclaim his Tusken heritage.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.730
He became a Tuskan warlord like his father
before him, leading his people to reclaim

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.360
the sands of Tatooine they believed were rightfully
theirs.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.370
One day, Hett and his army came across a small
moisture farm that was guarded by the Jedi

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.430
Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.010
Sensing that Hett was close to the dark side
and having sworn to defend Luke at all costs,

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.150
Obi-Wan was forced to engage against Hett
who refused to halt the attack.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.550
Obi-Wan not only beat Hett in their duel,
but he humanilated the man by unmasking his

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.990
face; which was considered the biggest insult
one can do in Tuskan culture.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.980
So his tribe left him and Hett was forced
to leave the planet after agreeing to do so

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.910
with Obi-Wan who spared his life in exchange.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.239
Hett became a bounty hunter but was later
captured by the Yuuzhan Vong which experimented

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:33.349
on him.

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.980
Following that, he turned to the darkside
and became Darth Crate, becoming the ruler

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.489
of a future new Sith Order that would adopt
the Rule of One philosophy.

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.810
Based on the comments, many of you voted for
A'Sharad Hett due to his unique and long lasting

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.960
story where he went from being a Tuskan Warrior,
to Jedi Knight, and eventually a Sith Lord.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.720
His duel wielding lightsaber style and ability
to go up against some of the best duelists

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.850
of his era were also among the other reasons
people voted for him.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.000
At Number 9, with 105 votes, is Maris Brood.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.790
As a Zabrak Padawan of the Jedi Order, Maris
Brood was trained in isolation on a starship

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.400
alone with her Master.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.069
Due to this seclusion, when Order 66 was given
they were left alive.

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:25.710
Having sensed the disturbance in the force
caused by the deaths of fellow Jedi, Brood’s

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.059
master went out to investigate to see what
happened, only to later give a final message

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:34.770
to his padawan to warn her that the Sith had
taken over and killed everyone.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.389
Brood almost fell to the darkside in an attempt
to avenge her Master and the Jedi Order, but

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.180
was intercepted by Shaak Ti who was able to
convince the young Zabrak to come with her

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.550
to Felucia.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.599
There she and Shaak Ti lived among the native
jungle Felucian Tribes for around the next

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:51.960
15 years.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.750
At some point, Darth Vader’s Sith assassin
Starkiller came to the planet and killed Shaak

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.139
Ti, resulting in Maris Brood to completely
fall to the dark side.

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:06.330
She would later kidnap Senator Bail Organa
who was on Felucia attempting to recruit Shaak

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.939
Ti, but would lose her hostage after being
defeated and spared by Galen Marek who had

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:14.729
his own uses for the Alderaan Senator.

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:19.180
Her fate after being allowed to live is currently
unknown.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.740
From the comments it appears most of you voted
for her because of her unique, guard shoto

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.990
lightsaber hilts, as well as for her unorthodox
fighting style.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.440
At number 8, with 114 votes, is K’Kruhk.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.189
He was a Whiphid Jedi Master and is best known
for just refusing to die.

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:41.610
In his first battle of the Clone Wars he was
believed to have been killed, only to return

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.439
back to the Jedi Order shortly afterwards.

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:48.849
Same thing happened with his fight against
General Grievous on Hypori, where he was believed

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:50.059
to have been killed.

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:55.210
But instead when his body is greatly injured,
it goes into a deep hibernation state, giving

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.110
the appearance of death.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.889
During hibernation he is able to fully recover
in a few weeks.

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:06.270
Following his survival of Order 66, K'Kruhk
came across a group of Jedi younglings and

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.180
padawans; to which he took with him on an
uninhabited planet and protected them for

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.819
the entire Jedi Purge era.

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:17.220
K’Kruhk lived long enough to join Luke Skywalker’s
New Jedi Order, becoming a Master within the

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.000
temple of Yavin 4.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.029
The Whiphid even lived past Luke; becoming
a senior member of the new Jedi Council during

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:48.809
the era of the Rule of One Sith as they made
their appearance within the galaxy.

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:52.740
At number 7, with 142 votes, is Kanan Jarrus.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.389
As a padawan of the Jedi Order, Kanan was
actually named Caleb Dume.

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:02.879
He survived after his master Depa Billaba
sacrificed herself during Order 66, leaving

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:04.509
Caleb all alone.

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:08.949
The following years, he changed his name to
Kanan Jarrus as a way to avoid authorities,

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:14.669
and he let go of his Jedi past, keeping his
Lightsaber broken apart and hidden from everyone.

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:20.300
He took on many jobs, such as a cargo transporter,
but usually quit after a few months as a way

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.729
to keep on the move.

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:24.960
He eventually met Hera and joined her fight
against the empire.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.789
They later created the Ghost crew and became
well-known rebels in the Outer rim.

00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:35.389
Kanan later began to teach Ezra Bridger to
become a Jedi, and he himself later became

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:39.740
a Jedi Knight as he was knighted by a force
vision Sentinel.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.599
His story finally came to an end after he
sacrificed himself to save Hera shortly before

00:07:44.599 --> 00:08:03.689
the Liberation of Lothal.

00:08:03.689 --> 00:08:08.319
At number 6, with 157 votes, is Quinlan Vos.

00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:13.009
Serving as an undercover agent for a majority
of the Clone Wars, Vos was very essential

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:18.430
in his contribution by providing vital intelligence
to the Republic that gave them intel of future

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.969
Separatist invasion plans and the like.

00:08:20.969 --> 00:08:26.050
Quinlan Vos came from a people known as the
Kiffar, which were uniquely connected to the

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:30.449
force that allowed them to see past events
by touching affected objects.

00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:35.099
He was able to effectively use this power
of his during his undercover missions to learn

00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:39.650
the secrets of his enemies by simply touching
objects they had interacted with.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:43.990
His survival of Order 66 differed in both
Canon and Legends.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:50.090
In Canon, Quinlan Vos’ survival of Order
66 is only assumed as his name appeared among

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:53.410
the Inquisitors list of names of possible
survivors.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.960
Seeing how Vos was likely in an undercover
mission during the time of Order 66, he wouldn’t

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:03.320
have had any clones around to attack him,
let alone confirm his death or survival.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:08.800
In Legends however, Quinlan Vos was on Kashyyyk
serving as a Jedi General as he had exhausted

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.760
his use as an undercover agent by that point.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.060
The clones in his company blasted him with
a turbolaser cannon from a Juggernaut tank

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.080
when Order 66 was issued.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.591
Vos barely survived and made a run for it
within the deep jungles of Kashyyyk, eventually

00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:26.520
coming to the conclusion that the entire Jedi
Order must have suffered a similar fate of

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.990
betrayal as him.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:32.450
Although initially hoping to avenge the death
of his fellow Jedi, Vos’ soon accepted that

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.940
such an act would be near impossible for him
to accomplish on his own.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.960
He ultimately took refuge among the deep jungles
of Kashyyyk where he was protected by a Wookiee

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.820
tribe that was loyal to the Jedi, where he
met up with the woman he served with as an

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:50.000
undercover agent and together they had a son
named Korto Vos.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.140
Quinlan Vos’ story ends there, where he
likely spent the rest of his life in hiding

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.630
with his family among the deep jungles of
Kashyyyk.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:02.950
Also fun fact: Quinlan Vos first appeared
in Episode 1: The Phantom Menace where he

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:08.190
can be scene in the background on Tatooine,
in which he was on an undercover mission.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:12.430
Later he came to regret not realizing that
Qui-Gon needed dire help of getting off the

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:17.380
planet, noting he would have helped his fellow
Jedi Master gain access to a ship had he known

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.440
of his situation.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.880
Most of Quinlan Vos’s votes came from those
who enjoyed his journey from being initially

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:29.130
obsessed with destroying the Sith, to eventually
accepting his destiny to something else, like

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:33.880
raising his own son and being with his family.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.440
At number 5, with 232 votes, is Shaak Ti.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:43.400
While initially not regarded as powerful as
many of her peers when she was first seated

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:48.360
on the High Council, focusing most of her
time on her negotiation and diplomacy skills

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:53.180
around that time, Shaak Ti quickly adapted
into becoming one of the finest warriors of

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:58.130
the entire Order after receiving a full dose
of the harsh reality of war during the early

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.130
stages of the Clone Wars.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:04.590
After recovering from her injuries dealt by
General Grievous, Shaak Ti went on to master

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:09.550
the fighting style that involved balancing
out lightsaber strikes and direct force abilities,

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:14.180
while also heavily relying on using the environment
to her own advantage; whether it be by using

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.910
it to directly attack and distract her opponents,
or by consuming the life forces of the nearby

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.340
vegetation to empower herself.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:25.600
By the end of the war, she was likely among
the top 5 most powerful members of the High

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:31.370
Council, with it not being too unreasonable
to argue her position among the top 3 right

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.550
behind Yoda and Mace Windu.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:38.210
While in Canon she has been stated to have
died during the Jedi Temple attack, in Legends

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.690
she was able to escape and flee to Felucia.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:45.950
She came across the unsettled padawan Maris
Brood and was able to convince the lost Jedi

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:47.960
to join her on Felucia.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:53.060
While on Felucia, Shaak Ti covered nearly
the entire planet in light side energies and

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:57.990
created a small community of Felucian natives
that were solely loyal to her, in preparation

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.780
for the inevitable confrontation with the
Sith.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:05.840
And that day indeed did come when Darth Vader’s
assassin Starkiller arrived to finish off

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.920
one of the last surviving Jedi Council Members.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:13.110
When their duel started, Shaak Ti initially
pummeled Starkiller with her overwhelming

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:17.610
force abilities and the strikes from the massive
Sarlacc pit that she commanded.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:22.290
Although it appeared Shaak Ti outmatched the
Sith Assassin; Starkiller’s brutal training,

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:27.180
experience in killing other Jedi, and most
importantly, unbreakable commitment to satisfying

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:31.600
his Master’s will allowed him to push through
the punishment he was dealing against long

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.950
enough to strike against Shaak Ti to greatly
injure her.

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:39.570
Whether accepting her defeat or believing
her opponent had enough light in him for redemption,

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:44.460
Shaak Ti decided to end her own life by throwing
herself into the Sarlacc Pit right before

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:49.090
Starkiller, who for a split second attempted
to save her, an act he came to question for

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:52.930
a long time afterwards as to why a small part
of him tried to save her.

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:57.730
Funny enough, when Shaak Ti died, the entire
planet had a rapid shift into the dark side

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:02.240
to make up for her lightside empowerment of
Felucia, which unnaturally shifted the energies

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.010
to the light for too long.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:08.980
As a way to make up for that long imbalance,
the planet turned into the other extreme by

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:13.620
falling into complete darkness, corrupting
nearly every living being on it, including

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.460
even Maris Brood.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:19.630
Many of you voted for Shaak Ti due to her
being one of the last surviving High Council

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:25.160
members after Order 66, as well as for her
choosing the planet Felucia for her hiding

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:31.190
place, becoming the chaotic planet’s lightside
beacon in the process.

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:35.960
At number 4, with 297 votes, is Rahm Kota.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.920
During the Clone Wars, Rahm Kota refused to
lead an army of Clones as he both distrusted

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:45.240
them and believed they couldn’t be as creative
as regular beings for soldiers.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.260
This caused him to create his own private
militia during the war, that included members

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:54.140
from planetary security forces, mercancy groups,
and freed prisoners of war.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:58.430
This decision of his ultimately saved his
life as when Order 66 was given there were

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.190
no clones to attack him.

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:04.700
When news of the betrayal came, Kota and his
men stole a Republic cruiser and fled into

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:05.980
the Outer Rim.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:10.890
For the next few years Kota amassed a small
army and a couple of bases to oppose the new

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:12.320
Galactic Empire.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.760
He was one of the earliest, large rebel cells
that openly opposed the Empire by striking

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.490
their operations within the Outer Rim regions.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:24.100
He attempted to bait Darth Vader to come fight
him, who instead ended up sending his Sith

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.370
assassin Starkiller to go kill Kota instead.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:31.210
Starkiller was successful in defeating the
Jedi Master, blinding him in the process,

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:35.680
but was unable to confirm his death as the
old man fell from the platform they were fighting

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.680
on.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.630
Kota survived and gave up, becoming a drunk
for the next couple of months.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:44.760
He eventually was brought back into action
by Starkiller, who deceived the Jedi into

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:49.370
thinking he was an ally, helping him gather
the Empire’s allies into one place for them

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.400
to be destroyed all at once.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:56.270
Eventually Kota and the other captured rebel
leaders were saved by the redeemed Starkiller,

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:58.660
now known simply as Galen Marek.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:03.400
After the rescue, Kota remained within the
newly created Rebel Alliance and led some

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.690
of its earliest battles, including the attack
on Kamino.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:10.810
He eventually mentored the Starkiller clone
who came to his aide following his escape

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:11.880
from Vader.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:16.090
Kota remained within the Rebel Alliance up
until the Battle of Yavin, where his fate

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:20.820
afterwards is currently unknown; though it’s
likely he died sometime shortly afterwards

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:25.900
seeing how he was not present in any other
conflicts after the first Death Star’s destruction.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:30.520
Many of Rahm Kota’s votes came from people
who liked his story and appearance in the

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:34.920
Force Unleashed games, as well as for him
raising his own army during the Clone Wars,

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:39.910
and later using it to fight against the Empire
on his own.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:44.300
At number 3, with 314 votes, is Yoda.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:49.040
Serving as the final Grand Master of the old
Jedi Order, Yoda was regarded as the most

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.250
powerful Jedi to ever exist in history up
to that point in time.

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:58.460
After failing to destroy the Sith Lord Darth
Sidious, Yoda fled to Dagobah where he remained

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:02.750
secluded from the rest of the galaxy as his
powerful lightside presence was covered by

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.870
the planet’s dark side energies.

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:08.870
While there, he remained connected to the
living force and was able to communicate and

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:13.170
help guide both surviving and forthcoming
Jedi throughout the galaxy during the dark

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:14.170
times.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:18.620
His ultimate, final contribution was helping
train Luke Skywalker in the ways of the force,

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:22.960
who ended up saving his own father and bringing
an end to the rule of the Sith.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:27.560
Yoda got much love for his commitment to guiding
other Jedi survivors in the force throughout

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:32.210
the Great Purge after Order 66, and for being
the one who trained Luke.

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:37.080
He also got votes for the way he survived
Order 66 and how he infiltrated the Temple

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.850
to find out exactly what had happened.

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:46.370
At number 2, with 929 votes, is Obi-Wan Kenobi.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:51.250
Given the daunting task of training the believed
Chosen One at a very young age, Obi-Wan was

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:55.270
given perhaps the greatest responsibility
of any other Jedi of his era.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:17:00.381
When the Clone Wars erupted, Obi-Wan was made
into a High General and given command of the

00:17:00.381 --> 00:17:06.059
Third System Army of the Republic, which included
the 212th Attack Battalion.

00:17:06.059 --> 00:17:10.779
The amount of punishment Obi-Wan faced during
the war was second to none; as he survived

00:17:10.779 --> 00:17:16.009
multiple brutal confrontations from the separatists
most powerful minions, including Ventress

00:17:16.009 --> 00:17:17.179
and Durge.

00:17:17.179 --> 00:17:22.129
He also survived multiple deadly explosions
like the Coruscant Administrative Sector terrorist

00:17:22.129 --> 00:17:26.360
attack, and the extreme torture and imprisonment
at the hands of Ventress.

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:31.059
At first the Sith wished to turn Obi-Wan to
the darkside, believing he’d be a useful

00:17:31.059 --> 00:17:35.340
asset to them, but eventually decided his
commitment to the Jedi was too great for him

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.450
to betray it.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:41.289
As the war progressed, Palpatine went out
of his way to stage Obi-Wan’s invasion plans

00:17:41.289 --> 00:17:45.809
in order to have the Jedi Master get killed,
believing his death would have helped Anakin’s

00:17:45.809 --> 00:17:50.120
fall to the dark side, which is why Obi-Wan
encountered the Jedi slayer General Grievous

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:54.690
so many times across the war, as Palpatine
was hoping the cyborg general would be able

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.190
to kill Anakin’s Master once and for all.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:01.840
But Obi-Wan was too much of a beast to die
like that, and actually ended up killing the

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.460
injured General Grievous late in the war.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:10.730
When Order 66 happened, Obi-Wan survived the
impact blast from the AT-TE mass-driver cannon

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:15.259
and later met up with Yoda, where together
they learned of Anakin’s fall to the darkside.

00:18:15.259 --> 00:18:20.279
Devastated by his apprentice’s fall, Obi-Wan
did what he believed was necessary and sought

00:18:20.279 --> 00:18:24.830
out to defeat Anakin, in which he was able
to gravely injure the fallen Jedi.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:29.999
Following that, Obi-Wan made it his life mission
to protect Anakin’s son, Luke Skywalker,

00:18:29.999 --> 00:18:33.600
by overseeing him during his childhood on
Tatooine.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.809
Eventually together Obi-Wan and Luke attempted
to bring the stolen Death Star plans to the

00:18:37.809 --> 00:18:41.390
Rebel Alliance, but were taken in by the Death
Star’s tractor beam.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:46.360
While aboard the Imperial Superweapon, Obi-Wan
confronted his former apprentice once again,

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.070
but this time allowed himself to be struck
down, as the Jedi Master believed he would

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:54.130
be a far greater help as a force ghost to
Luke than he would have been in the living

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.690
flesh.

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:59.970
Before we reveal number 1, we have a few honorable
mentions.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:04.789
First is the Grand Inquisitor, for getting
the 11th most votes on the poll.

00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:09.880
He was originally a Jedi Temple guard, who
was eventually swayed to betray the Jedi after

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:14.889
hearing Barriss Offee’s speech during her
trial as he was among her escort.

00:19:14.889 --> 00:19:21.110
Second is Ikrit, for having perhaps the most
epic Order 66 survival story of any Jedi;

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.600
where he literally slept through the entire
thing on Yavin 4.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:29.470
He also slept through the whole Clone Wars
as well, only waking up about 40 years later

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.929
after being discovered by a few of Luke’s
students.

00:19:31.929 --> 00:19:38.570
The final honourable mention is Empatojayos
Brand, who after surviving grieve injuries

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:44.980
following Order 66, was able to become a King
on an entire planet, bringing his Jedi ideals

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:48.190
into how he ruled his people.

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:54.259
Finally at number 1, with 1,103 votes, is
Ahsoka Tano.

00:19:54.259 --> 00:19:59.340
She was the Jedi padawan of Anakin Skywalker
who ultimately left the Jedi order following

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:04.009
a false accusation from the Jedi Council who
believed she was involved in the attack on

00:20:04.009 --> 00:20:05.190
the Temple.

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:09.570
Despite this, she later returned to help the
Republic during its invasion of Mandalore,

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.399
to which she confronted Maul.

00:20:11.399 --> 00:20:15.879
While the full details of this confrontation
are not entirely out, as it’s likely it

00:20:15.879 --> 00:20:20.600
will be fully shown to us in the upcoming
new season of The Clone Wars, we do know that

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:25.370
when Order 66 was issued during that Republic
Siege, she escaped with the help of Captain

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:26.370
Rex.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:30.820
They later faked their deaths, with Ahsoka
burying her original lightsabers.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.790
She was later hunted by an Inquisitor, known
as the Sixth Brother.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:39.299
She was able kill him and then took his red
lightsaber crystals, purified the crystals

00:20:39.299 --> 00:20:43.850
with the light side, and they became white
as a result, which she continued to use from

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:46.330
then on in her new lightsaber hilts.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:52.110
She eventually met with Bail Organa and joined
the Rebel Alliance, taking the codename Fulcrum,

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:55.749
to which she was tasked in recruiting and
connecting active rebel cells.

00:20:55.749 --> 00:21:00.809
Later, she fought Darth Vader and found out
that he used to be her old master, Anakin

00:21:00.809 --> 00:21:01.809
Skywalker.

00:21:01.809 --> 00:21:07.010
During their duel, Ahsoka was pulled into
the World Between Worlds realm by Ezra, who

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:11.419
likely pulled her into the future as well
by bring her into his present.

00:21:11.419 --> 00:21:14.104
She was allowed to return back to the normal
galaxy where she entered the ancient Temple

00:21:14.104 --> 00:21:15.104
on Malachor.

00:21:15.104 --> 00:21:17.619
She was eventually able to leave the planet
and meet up with Sabine following the defeat

00:21:17.619 --> 00:21:19.100
of the Empire.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:23.390
Together they made it their mission to find
Ezra after he disappeared following the Liberation

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:24.390
of Lothal.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:30.250
Ahsoka got many votes for how she survived
Order 66 by faking her death with Rex, as

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:34.999
well as for always fighting for what she believed
was right, and for helping build up the early

00:21:34.999 --> 00:21:43.739
foundation of what would eventually become
the Rebel Alliance that went on to fight against

00:21:43.739 --> 00:21:52.150
the Empire.
