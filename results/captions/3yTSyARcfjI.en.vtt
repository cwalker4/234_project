00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.510
What will be the biggest stories

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:03.960
of the year ahead?

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.710
In 2019, the driverless
revolution finally hits the road.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.310
So, this is science fiction

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.370
that's gonna become science fact.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.360
New tech pays tribute to the old masters.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.560
You'll have an explosion
of Leonardo mania in 2019.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.080
Flights will be cheaper than ever.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.040
And, 50 years after the
riots that kick-started

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.143
the modern gay-rights movement,
the fight goes global.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.130
In 2019, power dressing will
take on a whole new meaning,

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.390
when this strange looking
clothing hits the market.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.110
Not so much high fashion as high tech,

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.100
it's a suit with built in power,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.190
that will literally get people moving.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.270
The suit that we're introducing in 2019

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.700
is actually an assist suit,
so you have to be moving.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.510
Think of it kind of like
an electric bicycle,

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.950
you're pedaling, and getting extra power.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.680
Part of the wearable robotics revolution,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.870
the suit is made up of
battery powered muscle packs,

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.600
which contract just like a human muscle

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.410
to boost the wearer's strength.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.990
Those robotic muscles that we're providing

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.380
actually turn on and
provide strength to the body

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.453
in a coordinated way, when you
need it, while you're moving.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.500
With the global population of over 60's

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.580
expected to more than double by 2050,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.340
and retirement age increasing,

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.210
there's no shortage of potential markets.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.970
In Japan, the average age of
a construction worker is 48,

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.380
so there's lots of demand
for the labor workforce.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.740
But, don't expect the suits

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.540
to ease the burden on aching limbs

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.510
and overstretched health
services any time soon.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.690
As these suits don't come cheap.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.460
According to the manufacturer,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.210
they'll retail for around the cost

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.460
of a bespoke tailored suit.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.240
The challenge globally is how do we

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.440
get such technologies to everybody?

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.820
It doesn't happen in the way that,

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.330
say for example, formula one technology

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.683
eventually trickles down
into the average car.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.330
2019 will be the year

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.210
low cost, long haul travel takes off.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.850
You'll be able to buy a 10,000 mile flight

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.810
from London to Sydney for around $350.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.123
And, this is why.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.030
The world will boast
two new state of the art

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.060
megahub airports, and
competition between them

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.810
will drive down the cost of flying.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.360
Daxing Airport, outside
Beijing, is due to open in 2019.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.080
And, will feed growing demand
for air travel in China.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.519
Over the next 20 years, the number

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.530
of Chinese air passengers
is set to triple.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.800
Beijing already has

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.900
one of the world's biggest airports.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.510
And, for China, this new Megahub

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.630
will send an important
message to the world.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.010
The opening of Daxing Airport

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.010
is a symbol that the center
of the world's economy

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.943
has shifted east to China.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.770
Rivaling Daxing,

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.350
as a national symbol of global prestige,

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.110
will be a new Megahub airport in Istanbul.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.760
Opened in 2018, it covers a
staggering 26 square miles,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.380
an area larger than the
island of Manhattan.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.040
And, in 2019, consumers will again

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.620
be the beneficiaries of a
state sponsored economic push.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.890
The Turkish government has actually

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.030
been giving fuel subsidies to its airlines

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.853
to try and help bring the
tourism industry back.

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.440
But, the low fares offered by competition

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.430
between these hubs could be short-lived.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.970
In a few years, many airlines will begin

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.320
offsetting their carbon, with the costs

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.680
potentially passed down to passengers.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.750
You could describe 2019, perhaps,

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.260
as being the year to
fly, because who knows

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.490
what's gonna happen to airfares when

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.610
the airlines actually have to start paying

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.953
to offset their emissions.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.370
We discovered that Americans
consider homosexuality

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.190
more harmful to society than adultery,

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.750
abortion, or prostitution.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.570
In 2019, LGBT communities

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.270
will mark the anniversary
of a seminal event.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.680
It will be 50 years since
patrons at New York gay bar,

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.343
the Stonewall Inn, resisted
police attempts to arrest them.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.770
The resulting Stonewall Riots,

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.800
kick-started the modern
gay-rights movement.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.150
I think anniversaries
like the Stonewall Riots

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.670
are important because they remind us

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.010
just how far we've come.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.800
But also, how much change is still needed

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.610
because those sorts of
repressions and violence

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.647
is still happening in much of the world.

00:04:55.209 --> 00:04:57.420
In many countries, the laws

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.580
that continue to allow
intolerance and inequality

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.700
have their roots in religion.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.340
These laws originate
from two main sources,

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.750
Sharia law, and the British colonial

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.623
exportation of Christian principles.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.400
But, one former British colony

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.840
has given hope to the
global movement for change.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.110
In 2018, India
decriminalized homosexuality,

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.210
and guy-rights campaigners
hope 2019 will be

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.093
the year other former
British colonies follow suit.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.460
In February, Kenya's high court will rule

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.200
on whether to decriminalize
same-sex intimacy,

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.173
which is currently punishable
with up to 14 years in prison.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.800
Decriminalization would
mean, for the first time,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.070
LGBT Kenyans would start to participate

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.560
within the Kenyan democracy as equals.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.760
We're going to be just a step closer

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.123
to figuring out how an
equal Kenya looks like.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.750
Campaigners hope that decriminalization

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.100
could start a domino effect across Africa.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.810
I think it will be a
tipping point for Africa.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.110
It will be the beginning of
the unraveling of these laws.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.790
The Stonewall rioters

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.710
fought for the right to be free.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.070
And, fundamental human
rights will remain at the top

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.363
of the agenda for sexual
and gender freedom in 2019.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.620
In 2019, people are
actually gonna be paying

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.790
to take robo-taxis in some
cities in America, at least.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.590
So, this is sort of science fiction

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.070
that's gonna become science fact.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.270
With GM launching it's
driverless taxi service,

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.600
and Waymo expanding its
robo-taxis to new cities,

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.270
2019 will be the year

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.120
the driverless car
revolution hits the road.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.150
So, 2019 is a race to the starting line.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.810
I think what gets interesting is when

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.640
this technology starts to scale up,

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.070
reach more cities, and ultimately,

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.870
more people have access to
this really great technology.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.040
Knight Rider.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.230
It was hit 1980's TV show

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.460
Knight Rider that
popularized self-driving cars

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.363
controlled by artificial intelligence.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.360
Since then, billions of
dollars of investment

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.100
have fueled the drive to
turn the idea into reality.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.910
Dubai has committed to
a quarter of all trips

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.670
being driverless by 2030.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.400
And, the driverless car industry

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.110
will be worth a predicted
$550 billion by 2026.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.900
We're talking very, very large numbers,

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.870
and that number reflects
the optimism that this is

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.670
going to be a very significant
technology in the future.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.250
But, the advance of driverless cars

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.183
could be held up by a red flag.

00:07:59.183 --> 00:08:01.690
As in March of 2018,

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.733
the first person was killed
by a self-driving car.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.480
At the moment, about 40,000 people

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.196
are killed on the roads, in
America alone, each year.

00:08:11.196 --> 00:08:14.480
So, imagine if you improved safety by 99%,

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.200
so you then are talking
about 400 road deaths a year.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.770
I think that would still
be quite a hard sell.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:23.230
That's somebody being killed
by a robo-taxi every day.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.060
But, manufacturers are confident

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.370
that the inevitable progress of technology

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.230
will win over the skeptics.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:31.590
There is no cap on what
a computer could do

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.520
in terms of safety,
they'll just get better

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.250
and better every year.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:38.430
I think you could pretty
quickly see a flip from,

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:40.820
I don't wanna share the road
with these killer machines,

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.540
to, I don't wanna share the road

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.190
with these killer humans anymore.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.340
May 2019 will mark 500 years

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.260
since the death of the greatest polymath

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.747
in global history, Leonardo da Vinci.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.370
I think you'll have an explosion

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:09.013
of Leonardo mania in 2019.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.750
Leonardo painted the world's

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.750
most expensive picture,
The Salvator Mundi,

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.783
which was auctioned for $450 million.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.940
But, he was also a brilliant
scientist and engineer.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.430
In 2019, his art and notebooks

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.410
will be taking center stage
at blockbuster exhibitions.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.780
If I could have an afternoon
with Leonardo da Vinci,

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.160
I'd show him the internet
because he would be

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.090
so thrilled at the way we can now have

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.173
ways to be curious about
anything we wanna know.

00:09:42.726 --> 00:09:44.900
Leonardo sketched out designs

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.370
for inventions that
followed centuries later,

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.350
such as scuba equipment, and the tank.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:52.930
And, in 2019, another of his designs

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:54.690
will be getting a new lease of life,

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.340
as a flying car becomes
commercially available.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.669
The car flies thanks to
folding helicopter blades,

00:10:01.669 --> 00:10:04.430
which are derived from
Leonardo's invention,

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:05.383
the aerial screw.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:10.040
Leonardo would've loved the
concept of a flying car.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.520
When you look at that aerial screw,

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.700
that was designed as a prop for a plane

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.360
to bring angels down from the rafters.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.970
But then, Leonardo blurs
the fantasy into reality,

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.760
and spends the rest of
life trying to build

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.363
a real flying machine.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:29.830
Leonardo was the original outsider.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:32.180
He's illegitimate, he's left handed,

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:36.501
he's a vegetarian, he's gay,
he wears short purple tunics.

00:10:36.501 --> 00:10:39.170
But, they love him in
Florence, they embrace him.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:41.709
And, that's the cool thing
about the Renaissance was,

00:10:41.709 --> 00:10:45.920
it embraced people who were
sometimes matchlessly weird.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.840
Five centuries after his death,

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.830
there are still simple
lessons he can teach

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.720
today's divided world.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.330
Leonardo was very tolerant, he realized

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.090
that we should bring people together,

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.930
not separate into tribes.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.350
These are the type of
things that we're still

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:04.593
trying to learn in 2019,
500 years after he died.
