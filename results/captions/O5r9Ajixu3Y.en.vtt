00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.889
Welcome to Hollywood Graveyard where we
set out to remember and celebrate the

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.540
lives of those who lived to entertain us,
by visiting their final resting places.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.250
Today we're concluding our tour of
Hillside Memorial Park where we'll find

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.540
such stars as Moe Howard, Shelley Winters,
Milton Berle and many more.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.800
Join us won't you?

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.700
For this second and last part of our tour
of Hillside Memorial Park we'll expand

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.760
out to the grounds, courts, and open-air
mausoleums across the cemetery.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.420
If you haven't done so already be sure to check
out part 1.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.739
We'll begin right of the main

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.390
entrance and office in the Acacia
section. On the west side of one of the

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.460
walls that reaches north is the crypt of
America's first television star, Milton Berle.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.420
Like so many of his era he began
in vaudeville and radio before moving

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.880
into television. His TV show, which began
in 1948, dominated the airwaves and

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.350
quickly became the most popular show on
television. On Tuesday evening when his

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.880
show was on fewer movie tickets were sold
and many businesses shut down for an

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.720
hour so audiences wouldn't miss
Berle's show. He soon became

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.240
affectionately known throughout the
nation as Uncle Miltie and Mr. Television.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:56.280
[music]

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.240
In addition to television he had a
successful film career, starring in films

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.820
like It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.020
Heading to the west side of the next
wall down, way up at the top, we find the

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.400
crypt of Nell Carter. She was a singer
and actress who made her Broadway debut

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.209
in 1971. Her breakout role came in 1978s
Ain't Misbehavin', a role which earned her

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.200
a Tony Award and later an Emmy for the
TV performance of the same production

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:48.340
[music]

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.960
Starting in 1981 she starred in the
sitcom Gimme a Break, for which she

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.040
earned both Golden Globe and Emmy
nominations.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.960
Let's head across the street

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.130
and up the hill toward the mausoleum.
Just east of a tree and bench is the

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.400
grave of Shelley Winters.
She was an actress who broke into

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.780
Hollywood as a blonde bombshell in the
1940s, around the same time as her

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.090
roommate, Marilyn Monroe. But it was her
departure from this sexpot image in 1951s

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.090
A Place in the Sun that launched her
career and earned her critical acclaim.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.940
She would go on to become one of the
great actresses of screen and stage,

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.100
starring in films like the Diary of Anne
Frank, and A Patch of Blue, both of which

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.520
earned her an Oscar.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.580
"Where would we even find a cellar, or a closet?

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.840
Mr. Frank,

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.000
you told him you would never forget what he did

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.050
for you when you first came to Holland.
You said you never would be able to

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.460
- repay him."
- "If my husband had any obligations to
you his paid it over and over."

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.340
She can also be seen in Stanley Kubrick's Lolita.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.359
Let's head back toward the entrance and
across the street to the west to the

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.820
Memorial Garden. Further west is the
Court of Dedication. Next to this central

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.949
sidewalk is the grave of Sorrell Booke.
He was an actor best known for his role

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:33.500
as Boss Hogg in a popular 70s and 80s TV
series, The Dukes of Hazzard.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.160
"Boss Jefferson Davis Hogg was born on the dirt floor of a sharecroppers shack;

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.180
from there things kind of went downhill.
But everybody has a talent, and Boss has

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.550
a gift of graft. In a dazzling career in
Hazzard County ranging from moonshine to

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.740
political corruption, Boss has been
chased by everything from revenuers to

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.849
bloodhounds to irate husbands. Even if
the city cops do spot his license it really

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:04.120
don't matter none, 'cause Boss changes license plates like he does his underwear."

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.660
Passing into the next courtyard west, then
immediately south to the small nearly

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.960
hidden Alcove of Dedication, we find the
crypt of Moe Howard along the far wall.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.340
Howard was a legendary actor and
comedian best known as one of The Three

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:23.659
Stooges, a comedy troupe which began in
the 20s with Ted Healy as 'Ted Healy and

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:30.080
his Stooges.' The team soon added Moe's
brother, Shemp, and Larry Fine. In the 30s

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.720
Shemp was replaced by younger brother
Jerome "Curly" Howard. Re-branded in the 30s

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.780
as the Three Stooges
they now consisted of their best-known

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:45.110
lineup: Larry, Curly, and Moe. They signed
with Columbia where they made nearly 200

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.944
short films, known for their unique
slapstick humor.

00:05:48.944 --> 00:05:52.040
Moe was the de facto leader of the group.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.400
"Moe! Moe! He's right; it's a
ghost! It's right there... it's on the..."

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.960
"Oh, you too eh?

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.660
I'm gonna have trouble with you. Well let me give you a little advice."

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:05.400
"What?"

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:12.780
"That. Now go on go to sleep before I
murder ya. You guy's somnambulas?"

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.020
On the wall to the left is Meyer "Mickey"
Cohen. He was a Los Angeles-based

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:31.069
gangster and part of the Jewish mafia. He
worked under Bugsy Siegel until Siegel's

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:35.800
assassination in 1947, at which point
Cohen became the West Coast crime boss.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.639
He ruled the Hollywood underground from
the Sunset Strip, and during his tenure

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:44.840
rubbed shoulders with Hollywood legends
like Frank Sinatra, Robert Mitchum, and

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.780
Jerry Lewis.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.000
Back to the main road, past
the waterfall, on the right is Mount Shalom.

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:56.719
Just next to the road is the
grave of Paul Pink. While not a celebrity

00:06:56.719 --> 00:07:01.729
in the traditional sense,
in 1939 Pink and his wife Betty founded

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:06.379
a hot dog stand on La Brea and Melrose
that became as legendary as many of the

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:10.669
stars who have eaten there. Pink's hot
dogs has been satisfying Hollywood's

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:15.169
hunger for a good chili dog for nearly
80 years, and features Hollywood-inspired

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:21.729
dogs like the Mulholland Drive dog, the
Martha Stewart dog, and the Brando dog.

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:25.810
Continuing along this road we reach
the Court of Matriarchs on the right.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.560
Heading into the court we take the first
corridor on the right. Far on the right

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.810
side above eye-level is the crypt of Cyd
Charisse. Her skills as a dancer caught

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.650
the attention of Hollywood in the 30s
and 40s, and soon she would dance

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.750
alongside many of the leading men of the
era, like Fred Astaire in The Band Wagon,

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:49.040
and Gene Kelly in Singin' in the Rain.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.960
Entombed with Cyd is her husband Tony Martin.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.800
He was one of the popular singers
of the 40s and 50s. Perhaps his biggest

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.900
hit was "There's No Tomorrow," based on the Italian song, "O Sole Mio."

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:26.480
[music]

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:33.240
He had his own variety show, The Tony
Martin Show from 1954 to 1956. He can

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.150
also be seen in many musical films of
the era, including the Marx Brothers film,

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:43.940
The Big Store. He died in 2012 but sadly
still only has a temporary marker.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.160
Out back, to the east of the Court of
Matriarchs,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.510
is the Garden of Rachel. Along the south
wall is the grave of legendary

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:57.130
special-effects artist,
Stan Winston. He was known for creating

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:01.990
practical effects using robotics and
puppets. He worked with James Cameron to

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:06.580
bring the Terminator to life, with Steven
Spielberg to bring Jurassic Park's

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:12.340
dinosaurs to life, and with Tim Burton to
create Edward Scissorhands' scissorhands.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:17.160
He won four Academy Awards in his career.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.160
Northeast is the garden of Rebecca.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.380
Just off the curved sidewalk is the grave of
Adam Goldstein. He was a DJ and producer,

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:31.510
known as DJ AM. He collaborated with
such artists as Papa Roach, Will Smith,

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:36.700
and Travis Barker, and was a regular DJ
at nightclubs throughout the nation.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:42.520
He survived a plane crash with Blink-182
drummer Travis Barker in 2008 only to

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.760
die tragically a year later of an
apparent drug overdose.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.460
Back to the court

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:53.350
of Matriarchs we cross the street to
the north to the Canaan section. Let's go

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:58.030
left of the sidewalk. Almost all the way
down on the right is the crypt of writer/

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:03.610
director Richard Brooks. In 1967 he
adapted Truman Capote's In Cold Blood

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:09.130
for the screen. Other films include Cat
on a Hot Tin Roof and Elmer Gantry,

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:11.820
which won him an Oscar.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.360
Back again near the center of this

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:19.339
courtyard on the east-facing wall is the
crypt of Fritz Freleng. He was a

00:10:19.339 --> 00:10:23.749
cartoonist, animator, and director for the
Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie

00:10:23.749 --> 00:10:28.399
Melodie cartoons, and was instrumental in
introducing and developing many of their

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:33.079
beloved characters, including Porky Pig
Tweety Bird, Sylvester the Cat, and

00:10:33.079 --> 00:10:37.639
Yosemite Sam.
In fact Yosemite Sam was based on Freleng.

00:10:37.639 --> 00:10:42.439
Like fellow cartoonists Walt Disney and
Ub Iwerks, Freleng got his start in

00:10:42.439 --> 00:10:45.739
Kansas City before moving out to
Hollywood, where he worked for many of

00:10:45.739 --> 00:10:50.629
the major animation studios, including
Disney, but most notably Warner Bros.,

00:10:50.629 --> 00:10:55.540
where he directed more cartoons than any
other. His post Warner Bros. work

00:10:55.540 --> 00:11:00.400
includes the creation of the animated
opening for the 1963 film The Pink Panther.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.220
The popularity of the animation
led to the creation of an animated short

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:08.929
film, The Pink Fink, which earned
Freleng an Oscar. His script features a

00:11:08.929 --> 00:11:13.120
lineup of dancing Looney Tunes
characters.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.299
Near the middle of the wall

00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:19.279
to the right we find Jan Murray. He was a
stand-up comedian, actor, and television

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:24.769
host. He made a name for himself as a
comedian on the borscht belt - a series of

00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:28.999
New York resorts popular with the Jewish
community. He soon made his way to

00:11:28.999 --> 00:11:33.589
television, guest-starring on many
popular shows of the day like Milton

00:11:33.589 --> 00:11:39.079
Berle's Show, and The Tonight Show. He
also hosted or was a guest panelist on

00:11:39.079 --> 00:11:43.730
several game shows in the 50s through
the 70s, including Dollar A Second,

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:48.140
Treasure Hunt, and The Hollywood Squares.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.500
Further along this wall, above eye level,

00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:55.189
is writer/producer Larry Gelbart.
He is perhaps best remembered as the

00:11:55.189 --> 00:11:59.360
writer and creator of the popular TV
series M*A*S*H.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:21.020
[music]

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:25.980
He was nominated for two Oscars in his
career, for his screenplays for Tootsie,

00:12:25.989 --> 00:12:30.999
and Oh God!, and co-wrote the popular
Broadway musical, A funny Thing Happened

00:12:30.999 --> 00:12:33.220
on the Way to the Forum.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.709
Rounding the corner, at the end of the next wall, is

00:12:35.709 --> 00:12:40.449
the crypt of Robert Sherman. With his
brother Richard, Robert Sherman was one

00:12:40.449 --> 00:12:45.459
of the most prolific composers of songs
for film in Hollywood history. He's most

00:12:45.459 --> 00:12:49.929
closely associated with Disney, having
written songs for Mary Poppins,

00:12:49.929 --> 00:12:52.420
The Jungle Book,
Winnie the Pooh, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:57.779
and more. Their songs include
"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,"

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:01.520
"Chim Chim Cheree,"

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.240
"Winnie the Pooh,"

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.580
"It's a Small World
After All,"

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.760
and "Feed the Birds," which was

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.420
reputed to have been Walt Disney's
favorite song.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:41.180
[music]

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.200
Continuing down this road east we

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.730
arrive at the Mount of Olives section.
Several spaces in from the road, just

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:54.260
past a tree and bench, is the grave of
actor Vic Morrow, who starred for six

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:59.690
seasons on the TV series Combat! in the
1960s. The role earned him an Emmy

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:04.550
nomination. He acted in nearly a hundred
productions throughout his career, but

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:08.960
sadly is best remembered for the manner
of his death - one of the few occurrences

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.970
of death on a film set. While shooting a
night scene for Twilight Zone: the Movie,

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:19.430
a pyrotechnic effect caused a helicopter
to crash on Morrow and two child actors.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.800
All three were killed instantly.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.460
Morrow's daughter is actress Jennifer Jason Leigh.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.880
Heading back around to the
Valley of Remembrance section, near the

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:38.210
middle of the cemetery, we find the grave
of Sherwood Schwartz, just north of the

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:42.560
wall and a tree. Schwartz was a
television writer and producer, best

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:47.520
remembered as the creator of several
popular television shows, like Gilligan's Island,

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.980
and the Brady Bunch.
He even co-wrote the theme songs for

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:56.280
these shows. In 2008 he was inducted into
the television Hall of Fame.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:23.400
[music]

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:29.440
Let's cross the wall to the south side,
to block 14. Here we find screenwriters

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.670
and twin brothers Philip and Julius Epstein. They remembered as the

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:38.840
screenwriters of the classic film
Casablanca. The screenplay won them an Oscar.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.980
They also wrote Arsenic and Old
Lace.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:46.460
Julius is here, next to Philip.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:51.960
Finally we head across the street to the
west, to the Courts of Faith and Truth.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.660
On the north end of this Court, on the
second level, we find the crypt of one of

00:15:55.660 --> 00:16:00.970
Hollywood's most legendary film
composers, Jerry Goldsmith. He is perhaps

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:05.830
best remembered today for composing the
music for the Star Trek films - the theme

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:10.140
was also used for Star Trek: The Next
Generation.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:26.440
[music]

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:31.580
He was incredibly versatile, able to
compose in a classic style like Star Trek,

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:35.120
or even avant-garde like Planet of
the Apes.

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:40.500
Other notable film scores include Patton,
Chinatown, Total Recall, and The Omen,

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.540
which won him an Oscar.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:17:10.500

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:15.339
