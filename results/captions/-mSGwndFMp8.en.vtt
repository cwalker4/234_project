I WAS COMING DOWN WEST 13th AND

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:01.694
THIS COUPLE WAS WALKING TOWARDS

BOYFRIEND SAID TO ME, "HEY, COOL

"THAT'S MEAN."

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:41.601
NOT MAKE YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND GET
BACK TOGETHER WITH YOU, BUT IT

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:44.737 align:start size:94% position:6%
WILL MAKE HER WORRY ABOUT YOU.
