00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:01.501
The Vice President:
Well, good morning,

00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:02.936
and thank you all for being here
for the second meeting

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:04.237
of the National Space Council.

00:00:04.237 --> 00:00:06.005
I want to thank all of
the members who are here,

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:07.607
the members of our
user advisory group,

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:09.876
and all of those
who have taken time

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:13.079
to join us in person and online.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.315
We'll go ahead
and get started.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:17.684
Today, we have two panel
discussions on the challenges

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.819
and opportunities facing
our national security,

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:22.489
and commercial space activities

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.158
that I just spoke about
in my opening remarks.

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:26.726
We're pleased to be joined

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:29.929
by an outstanding lineup
of expert witnesses

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.565
who will share their
insights and expertise

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:35.001
with the Council
in the moments ahead.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:38.338
But first off, I'd like to ask
some of the Council members

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:40.974
to provide updates
on the progress that we've made

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.342
since our first
meeting to implement

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:45.044
President Trump's vision for
American leadership in space.

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:49.516
I'm going to begin with our
National Security Advisor,

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:51.718
General H.R. McMaster.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.187
General, I want to commend
you first and foremost

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:55.789
and the National Security Agency

00:00:56.656 --> 00:01:00.593
for your efforts in support of
the National Space Council.

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:04.531
I specifically want to thank
the General Bill Likery

00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:06.366
of the National Security Council

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:09.869
for his extraordinary work on
the space strategic framework.

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.304
Could you please
give the Council

00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:13.306
an overview of that work?

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:16.676
General McMaster:
Thank you Mr. Vice President,

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:18.111
and thank you
for the opportunity

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:20.847
to provide an update
on the important progress

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:24.384
we have made in developing
the new strategy for space,

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:25.819
and I want to thank,
first of all,

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.654
fellow Council members here

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:29.355
for their
tremendous collaboration

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:31.591
and teamwork.

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:33.126
As you noted,
Mr. Vice President,

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:35.428
at the last Space Council
meeting in October

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:38.998
you approved the strategic
framework for the new strategy,

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:41.301
and I thought it might be
useful for our audience

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:44.037
to briefly summarize
that framework

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:46.639
and what we've done with
that framework since then.

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:52.679
As a reminder, the framework
contained three key elements.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:58.218
First, it defined
our vital interests in space

00:01:58.218 --> 00:02:01.721
to ensure unfettered
access to and freedom

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:04.624
to operate in the space domain,

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:08.995
to advance the security,
economic prosperity,

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.166
and scientific knowledge
of the nation.

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:17.604
Second, it set a desired
end state for the new strategy

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:19.606
to ensure U.S. leadership,

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:24.143
preeminence, and freedom 
of action in space

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:26.613
for decades to come.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:29.883
And finally, it outlined
four strategic objectives

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:31.718
in pursuit of our
vital interests.

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:36.589
They are, first, to strengthen
the safety, stability,

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.959
and sustainability
of space activities.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.796
Second, to deter and,
when necessary,

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:47.901
defeat adversary space
and counter-space threats

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:51.304
that are hostile to
the national interests

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:54.440
of the United States
and our allies.

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:58.778
Third, to partner with
the U.S. commercial sector

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.048
to ensure that American
companies remain

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:03.249
the leading providers

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:07.053
of traditional and innovative
space technologies,

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:10.557
goods, and services on
the international space market.

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:16.663
And fourth, to maintain
and extend U.S. human presence

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:20.934
and robotic explorations
beyond Earth,

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:23.369
to transform knowledge
of ourselves,

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:28.207
the planet, our solar system,
and the universe.

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:31.878
So, since October, at your
direction, Mr. Vice President,

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:33.980
we have developed
the lines of effort

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:36.549
and identified the specific

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.453
associated tasks to meet
the strategic objectives,

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:42.088
achieve our desired end state,

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:44.724
and advance our vital
interests in space.

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:48.661
The four interrelated
lines of effort are,

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:51.898
first, mission assurance.

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:55.335
We will accelerate
the transformation

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:57.203
of our space architecture

00:03:57.203 --> 00:04:00.340
by deliberately moving systems
from science and technology

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.242
phase to research 
and development phase,

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:05.945
to actual fielding
of capabilities.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.915
As a result, our space systems
will be more resilient,

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:12.652
more defendable,
more easily reconstituted,

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:14.754
and better service to orbit.

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:19.826
Our second line of effort is
on deterrence and war fighting.

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:22.762
Due to competitor
and adversary actions,

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:25.999
the space domain is
increasingly contested.

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:29.669
Space has now joined land, sea,

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.639
and air as a war
fighting domain.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.475
While we prefer the conflict
not extend to space,

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:39.379
the United States will be
prepared if it does.

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:42.782
Our third line of effort
is on organizational support.

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:45.318
We will pursue
improved foundational

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:47.253
capabilities, structures,

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:51.124
and processes to enable
more effective space operations.

00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:53.292
And our fourth and final line
of effort

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:56.929
focuses on conducive
environments,

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:57.964
both at home and abroad.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.166
As you mentioned
in your opening remarks,

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:01.768
Mr. Vice President,
we have work to do.

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:04.604
Domestically,
this includes streamlining

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:06.639
the regulatory environment

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.009
to better use
and support U.S. industry.

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.379
Internationally, this includes
pursuing bilateral

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:14.914
and multilateral engagements

00:05:15.448 --> 00:05:16.949
to enable human exploration,

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:19.385
promote burden sharing,

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:21.454
and foster cooperation

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:25.391
against threatening
adversary space actions.

00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:28.428
Mr. Vice President,
like our audience today

00:05:28.428 --> 00:05:30.997
and like the panels
that you'll see here today,

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:35.368
these efforts cut across
national security,

00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:38.071
commercial,
and civil space sectors,

00:05:38.905 --> 00:05:41.441
and the strategy
will not only advance

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:44.377
the benefits of space
for ourselves,

00:05:44.377 --> 00:05:47.113
but also ensure that
peoples of all nations

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:51.384
can benefit from the tremendous
potential that space offers.

00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:53.619
I should note that
the President's recent

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:54.387
budget submission,

00:05:54.387 --> 00:05:55.988
since Mick Mulvaney's not here:

00:05:55.988 --> 00:06:00.893
it increases the funding
for DOD space programs

00:06:00.893 --> 00:06:05.531
by over $1 billion
in fiscal year 2019 alone,

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:08.301
and by eight billion
over the next five years.

00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:13.172
NASA's budget for 2019 is being
increased by 300 million,

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.211
while also being restructured
to focus more on exploration.

00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:20.680
With your endorsement,
Mr. Vice President

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.215
and the President's approval,

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:24.150
we are prepared
to begin implementing

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.952
this national
strategy for space,

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:32.024
and periodically assess progress
and recommend adjustments

00:06:32.024 --> 00:06:34.494
to you and to the Council
and the President.

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:36.395
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

00:06:36.395 --> 00:06:38.598
The Vice President:
Great, thank you General,

00:06:38.598 --> 00:06:41.000
and thank you for
the great collaboration

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.735
between the National
Space Council

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:44.670
and the National
Security Council.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:45.972
It's been seamless,

00:06:45.972 --> 00:06:51.944
and we appreciate your update
for this meeting.

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:55.648
The acting administrator
of NASA, Robert Lightfoot,

00:06:57.884 --> 00:07:01.187
has been busy implementing
the space policy directive

00:07:01.187 --> 00:07:06.192
and also that direction
from the President,

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:09.395
guided the development of the
President's budget submission.

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:12.632
Perhaps you could give us

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:14.133
a brief overview

00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:15.368
of the budget presentation,

00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:16.736
and the implementation
of the directive.

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:19.038
Administrator Lightfoot:
Will do.

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:21.140
Thank you, Mr. Vice President
and fellow Council members,

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.475
especially those of you
that worked with us

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:25.645
on this development
of this answer and action

00:07:25.645 --> 00:07:27.413
to the space policy
directive one.

00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:31.484
What we did in developing
this initiative

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:33.719
was we came up with what we call
the Exploration Campaign.

00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:38.291
This Exploration Campaign
is a national and agency effort

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.959
focused on three core domains:

00:07:40.593 --> 00:07:43.696
lower earth orbit, lunar orbit
and the surface of the moon,

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:46.866
and Mars and other
deep space objectives.

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:52.071
The goals of this campaign
are to transition the U.S.

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:55.141
human spaceflight in lower earth
orbit to commercial operations,

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:57.376
which supports NASA
and the needs of an emerging

00:07:57.376 --> 00:07:59.345
private sector market,

00:07:59.345 --> 00:08:01.314
extend our long-duration U.S.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:03.549
human spaceflight operations
to the lunar vicinity,

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:07.720
enable long-term robotic
exploration of the moon,

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.456
both scientific and human,
as we move forward,

00:08:10.456 --> 00:08:12.191
in preparation
for further missions

00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:14.193
taking humans to Mars.

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:17.530
The objectives in there:
first of all,

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.464
we'll start with
lower earth orbit.

00:08:18.464 --> 00:08:20.399
Again, as I said, we want
to end direct support

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:22.068
to the ISS by 2025,

00:08:22.068 --> 00:08:24.070
while stimulating
commercial industry

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.938
to develop capabilities.

00:08:25.938 --> 00:08:28.207
NASA and the private
sector can utilize

00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:30.309
and meet NASA's exploration

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:32.545
risk mitigation and
scientific requirements.

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:35.915
Starting in 2018 we'll increased
the breadth and depth

00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:37.450
of the commercial

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.418
and international
lower earth activities.

00:08:39.418 --> 00:08:41.287
Specifically,
we'll offer to expand

00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:43.789
the international space station
partnerships to new nations.

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:48.794
Based on inputs from our current
ISS and commercial stakeholders,

00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:50.663
we'll shape the plan
to transition

00:08:50.663 --> 00:08:52.865
the international space station
as we've been asked to go do.

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:55.501
We'll extend
the public/private partnerships

00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:57.970
to help develop and demonstrate
the technologies

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.940
and capabilities that the new,
commercial products

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.909
can be brought to bear
in lower earth orbit.

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:06.279
At the moon,
we have two objectives.

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:08.047
Of course,
it's a long-term presence

00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:09.615
in the vicinity of the moon
and on the moon,

00:09:10.249 --> 00:09:11.784
again, both scientifically

00:09:11.784 --> 00:09:12.985
and from a human perspective.

00:09:13.786 --> 00:09:15.354
In the lunar orbit we'll conduct

00:09:15.354 --> 00:09:17.657
the first un-crewed mission
of the SLS Orion,

00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:19.959
first flight in 2020
to the moon,

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:22.161
and the crewed flight in 2023.

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:25.398
We intend to establish
a human tended

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:28.034
lunar orbiting platform
for crews to visit from Earth

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:30.069
to transit to
and from the lunar surface,

00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:33.506
and to depart to,
ultimately, return to Mars.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.176
We'll develop the lunar orbiting
platform gateway that,

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:40.513
at a minimum, it puts a power
of propulsion element out there,

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:42.148
and begins to put the habitat

00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:44.116
that we're going to need
to stay in when we go there.

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:46.385
At the surface,

00:09:46.385 --> 00:09:48.754
we'll orchestrate
a lunar robotics campaign

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:52.525
where the folks growing a
commercial base of partnerships

00:09:52.525 --> 00:09:55.962
and activity that can support
U.S. science, technology,

00:09:55.962 --> 00:09:57.596
and exploration objectives,

00:09:57.596 --> 00:09:59.699
and we'll include
international participation,

00:09:59.699 --> 00:10:01.067
where appropriate.

00:10:01.067 --> 00:10:02.902
We'll support a small
commercial lander

00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:05.171
initiative with initial
strategic presence on the moon

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:07.206
no later than 2020,

00:10:07.206 --> 00:10:09.575
develop a mid to large
scale lander initiative

00:10:09.575 --> 00:10:12.011
working toward human rating
a lander in the future.

00:10:12.578 --> 00:10:14.814
This initiative will focus
on enabling, again,

00:10:14.814 --> 00:10:16.515
commercial and
international partnerships.

00:10:17.083 --> 00:10:19.051
We'll also support an early
science and technology

00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:21.454
initiative that includes
cubesats,

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:24.323
lunar cubesats, a virtual lunar
institute, and other activities.

00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:26.659
This will further
enable and nurture

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:29.195
the entrepreneurial
and commercial market forces

00:10:29.195 --> 00:10:31.964
that will define the long-term
human exploration

00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:34.000
and advancement
of the lunar surface.

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:38.170
For Mars and other deep space
objectives that we have,

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.438
we really want
to maintain and grow

00:10:39.438 --> 00:10:41.374
the U.S. leadership at Mars.

00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:42.875
We have a rover
going in 2020,

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.113
as a first step to demonstrate
sample return strategy.

00:10:47.613 --> 00:10:49.648
It also is going to
take an experiment

00:10:49.648 --> 00:10:50.916
that is going to tell us
whether we can produce

00:10:50.916 --> 00:10:53.252
oxygen from
the atmosphere on Mars,

00:10:53.252 --> 00:10:55.621
a very exciting
mission for us then.

00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:57.156
We'll use this mission
as a building block

00:10:57.156 --> 00:11:00.192
for subsequent round-trip
robotic missions with,

00:11:00.192 --> 00:11:02.528
hopefully, the first historic
launch off of another planet

00:11:02.528 --> 00:11:05.064
and a sample return
through the lunar gateway

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:06.298
that we're building;

00:11:06.298 --> 00:11:08.801
again, broadening the
expirational architecture

00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:10.302
as we move forward.

00:11:10.302 --> 00:11:12.738
We'll prioritize these
investments to guide us

00:11:12.738 --> 00:11:15.608
and really align,
as General McMaster said,

00:11:15.608 --> 00:11:17.009
really align toward exploration.

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:19.412
It's a tremendous focus there
for us as we move forward.

00:11:19.412 --> 00:11:22.615
So, that's kind of the nuance
and the response to SPD1,

00:11:23.482 --> 00:11:26.318
and I think what you'll find,
Mr. Vice President,

00:11:26.318 --> 00:11:28.521
is this NASA team,
your industry team,

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:29.955
and our international
partners are ready,

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:31.624
and ready to get started.

00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:33.926
So, thanks for your support
in the 2019 budget.

00:11:33.926 --> 00:11:36.162
We did see the increase,
and we're ready to go do this.

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:37.163
Thank you.

00:11:37.163 --> 00:11:37.930
The Vice President: Great.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.598
(Applause.)

00:11:39.598 --> 00:11:40.800
Thank you, Robert. Well done.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.870
(Applause.)

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.939
We want to thank
the National Security Council

00:11:46.939 --> 00:11:49.809
and the NASA for doing
such a great job

00:11:49.809 --> 00:11:51.877
responding to the 45 day
reporting period.

00:11:53.012 --> 00:11:55.781
Not a lot happens in the
federal government in 45 days,

00:11:57.016 --> 00:11:59.418
but you all did
outstanding work,

00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:03.656
reflecting the President's
urgency on this effort.

00:12:04.457 --> 00:12:06.992
Two others that have
done excellent work

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.930
are the Commerce and
the Transportation Department.

00:12:12.264 --> 00:12:15.134
Transportation is represented
by Deputy Secretary Rosen

00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:17.369
and, of course,
Secretary Wilbur Ross

00:12:17.369 --> 00:12:19.438
is with us from
the Commerce Department.

00:12:21.273 --> 00:12:22.975
Jeff, if you want
to give us a quick update.

00:12:22.975 --> 00:12:25.478
I know that Secretary Chao
could not be with us today,

00:12:25.478 --> 00:12:28.514
but could you give us
a quick update

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:30.683
on some of
the recommended changes

00:12:30.683 --> 00:12:33.085
that transportation
has been working through,

00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:34.553
particularly with
regard to Commerce

00:12:34.553 --> 00:12:39.191
with regard to private space
exploration and development.

00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:41.427
Deputy Secretary Rosen: Yes,
thank you Mr. Vice President.

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:44.130
I'm so pleased to be here
with the Space Council

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.799
and all of us from the
Department of Transportation

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:48.134
very much appreciate

00:12:48.134 --> 00:12:49.735
and are grateful
for your leadership.

00:12:50.402 --> 00:12:52.505
Secretary Chao was unable
to make it today,

00:12:52.505 --> 00:12:54.773
but she asked that
I make very clear

00:12:54.773 --> 00:12:56.442
that the Department
of Transportation

00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:58.077
is strongly committed

00:12:58.077 --> 00:13:00.012
to regulatory streamlining

00:13:00.012 --> 00:13:03.015
and modernizing our commercial
space regulatory framework.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.952
As was mentioned at the previous
meeting of the Council,

00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:10.289
you asked us, along with OMB
and the Department of Commerce,

00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:14.193
to prepare a new 45 day plan
to overhaul, modernize,

00:13:14.193 --> 00:13:16.962
and streamline
our somewhat rusty

00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:19.331
commercial space
licensing framework.

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:20.900
So, we've worked
hard to do that,

00:13:21.534 --> 00:13:23.035
and we've come up
with some structural

00:13:23.035 --> 00:13:25.271
and meaningful changes
to the status quo,

00:13:25.938 --> 00:13:27.106
and I hope the work we did,

00:13:27.106 --> 00:13:28.741
in combination
with our colleagues

00:13:28.741 --> 00:13:30.176
on the Council
and other agencies,

00:13:30.176 --> 00:13:31.644
will meet with your approval.

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:33.245
There are five main elements

00:13:33.245 --> 00:13:35.014
that I just want to touch
on briefly today.

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:38.884
The first is we want
to implement

00:13:38.884 --> 00:13:41.287
accelerated rule-making plans,

00:13:41.287 --> 00:13:43.489
meaning that we shorten
the time lines

00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:47.259
that the FAA and the department
are working on

00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:49.662
to meet the ambitious schedule

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:51.530
that you and the Council
have set out.

00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:57.503
Second, is we want to provide
some immediate interim relief,

00:13:58.204 --> 00:14:00.306
such as the expanded
use of waivers

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:01.640
and programmatic approvals,

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.175
where they're appropriate,

00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:05.344
so that we can try to right away

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:07.813
begin facilitating the
objectives of the Council.

00:14:08.814 --> 00:14:12.685
A third piece of the plan
is to focus FAA resources

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:15.688
so that we strengthen
the portion of the FAA

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:18.591
that most directly
deals with licensing

00:14:19.158 --> 00:14:21.193
and the regulatory approvals

00:14:21.193 --> 00:14:24.296
so that we can accomplish the
goals that have been set out.

00:14:25.297 --> 00:14:29.768
A fourth item is to establish
a joint task force.

00:14:30.302 --> 00:14:33.505
The purpose of this is to
facilitate better coordination

00:14:33.505 --> 00:14:35.241
within the U.S. government

00:14:35.241 --> 00:14:38.611
so that people that need
regulatory approvals

00:14:39.111 --> 00:14:42.314
don't face confusing situations
as to who's doing what

00:14:42.314 --> 00:14:44.383
and how to get
the approvals they need.

00:14:45.217 --> 00:14:48.754
But then the fifth piece,
and perhaps the most important,

00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:51.056
is a new licensing framework.

00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:53.926
As was set out in recommendation
one for today's meeting,

00:14:54.493 --> 00:14:58.831
our ultimate aim
is a 21st-century file

00:14:58.831 --> 00:15:01.367
and fly kind of
licensing framework,

00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:05.704
and the plan includes specific
new regulatory deadlines

00:15:05.704 --> 00:15:08.907
and approaches in the aim
of getting us to a file

00:15:08.907 --> 00:15:12.811
and fly type regulatory approach
as quickly as possible.

00:15:13.712 --> 00:15:15.314
So, we look forward
to implementing

00:15:15.314 --> 00:15:16.982
this changed approach

00:15:16.982 --> 00:15:18.984
and delivering
on a more responsive,

00:15:18.984 --> 00:15:22.154
easier to navigate
and sensible commercial space

00:15:22.154 --> 00:15:23.822
regulatory framework,

00:15:23.822 --> 00:15:25.291
and very much look forward

00:15:25.291 --> 00:15:28.661
to working with all the folks
on this Council

00:15:28.661 --> 00:15:30.162
and others
to make that happen.

00:15:30.696 --> 00:15:32.665
Thank you.

00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:41.407
(Applause.)

00:15:41.407 --> 00:15:43.008
The Vice President:
Thank you, Jeffrey,

00:15:43.008 --> 00:15:46.712
and with that, let me recognize
the Secretary of Commerce,

00:15:47.713 --> 00:15:49.481
Wilbur Ross, who I know
has been working

00:15:49.481 --> 00:15:50.916
very closely with Secretary Chao

00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:54.753
to achieve exactly the
streamlining, the objectives,

00:15:54.753 --> 00:15:56.355
and the re-organization
that we've discussed.

00:15:56.355 --> 00:15:57.723
Mr. Secretary, thank you.

00:15:57.723 --> 00:15:59.224
Secretary Ross:
Thank you Mr. Vice President.

00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:05.130
Mr. Vice President, members of
the National Space Council,

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.300
users advisory group,
and distinguished guests,

00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:11.637
recently here
at Cape Canaveral,

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:15.441
SpaceX's Falcon heavy
rocket was launched.

00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:19.511
Two first stage boosters
disengaged on schedule

00:16:20.045 --> 00:16:22.348
and landed back here.

00:16:23.215 --> 00:16:24.883
This was their second use.

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:28.020
You saw one of them
as you came in.

00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:32.157
It will be ready
for its third launch,

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:35.994
an amazing technological
and commercial feat.

00:16:36.995 --> 00:16:40.432
Thanks to impressive
events such as this,

00:16:40.966 --> 00:16:44.870
the United States is the leader
in space once again.

00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:47.773
Somewhere out there in space,

00:16:47.773 --> 00:16:49.475
there is a bright red roadster

00:16:49.975 --> 00:16:52.344
going thousands
of miles per hour,

00:16:52.878 --> 00:16:54.713
the fastest car in history.

00:16:54.713 --> 00:16:55.514
(Laughter.)

00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:57.216
We had better keep up with it.

00:16:57.216 --> 00:16:58.884
(Laughter.)

00:16:58.884 --> 00:17:04.022
Space is already a
$330 billion industry,

00:17:04.022 --> 00:17:08.293
supporting 211,000
American jobs.

00:17:08.894 --> 00:17:14.366
But our share of
the 1,700 new companies

00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:17.169
created worldwide last year

00:17:17.169 --> 00:17:19.138
was only 45 percent,

00:17:19.671 --> 00:17:23.041
far lower than
our share of launches.

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:27.546
Private companies
funded $3.9 billion

00:17:28.247 --> 00:17:30.582
of our space effort last year,

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:35.621
but they're competing against
70 foreign governments.

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:38.490
So, they need all the support
we can give them.

00:17:39.658 --> 00:17:43.328
Countries new to space
have an inherent advantage

00:17:43.328 --> 00:17:46.965
in terms of the
regulatory environment

00:17:46.965 --> 00:17:51.036
because they carry no baggage
from the earlier,

00:17:51.036 --> 00:17:55.474
simpler days of space.
In contrast,

00:17:55.474 --> 00:17:59.578
much of our remote
sensing regulatory regime

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:01.547
is 25 years old.

00:18:02.214 --> 00:18:08.587
Space 25 years ago bears little
resemblance to space today.

00:18:09.555 --> 00:18:12.391
Now the rate of innovation
is extraordinary.

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:14.493
So, we need an adaptive

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:18.831
and relatively permissive
regulatory system.

00:18:19.665 --> 00:18:25.771
NOAA, FAA, FCC, and other
agencies each have a role,

00:18:26.405 --> 00:18:30.509
and they all have
obligations to DOD,

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:33.479
the IC and the state as well.

00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:37.583
That complexity
inherently causes delay.

00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:41.854
Since the Council's first
meeting in October,

00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:46.525
Commerce's review of the
outdated regulatory framework

00:18:47.125 --> 00:18:50.295
and discussions
with an ambitious,

00:18:50.295 --> 00:18:52.664
but frustrated space industry,

00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:57.736
made it clear that the rate
of regulatory change

00:18:57.736 --> 00:19:01.240
must match the rate
of technological change.

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:04.610
That is how we will ensure

00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:08.881
that businesses choose
the United States

00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:11.817
as their flag
of choice for space.

00:19:12.618 --> 00:19:16.822
So, at the department,
we're working to create a new,

00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:20.392
one-stop shop
for space commerce.

00:19:21.126 --> 00:19:24.596
Mr. Vice President,
with the Council's direction,

00:19:24.596 --> 00:19:27.833
I will move the Office
of Space Commerce

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:31.370
and the Commercial Remote
Sensing Regulatory Affairs

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:35.741
Office from NOAA
to my direct oversight

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:37.676
in the Office
of the Secretary.

00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:46.685
(Applause.)

00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:51.490
This elevated and amplified
Office of Space Commerce

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.926
will coordinate all space

00:19:53.926 --> 00:19:55.294
related functions

00:19:55.294 --> 00:19:56.962
at the department;

00:19:56.962 --> 00:20:00.065
remote sensing,
spectrum policy,

00:20:00.999 --> 00:20:05.103
export controls, business
and trade promotion,

00:20:05.103 --> 00:20:07.239
to name a few.

00:20:07.239 --> 00:20:09.875
In addition to
the proposed relocation

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:11.910
of the Office of Space Commerce,

00:20:12.544 --> 00:20:16.248
we will also soon name
a director of that office.

00:20:17.316 --> 00:20:22.354
Also, we are providing to the
Bureau of Industry and Security

00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:25.991
and the NTIA additional funding

00:20:25.991 --> 00:20:29.094
for their space
focused activities,

00:20:29.728 --> 00:20:32.798
and our foreign
commercial service teams

00:20:32.798 --> 00:20:36.034
located in 105 cities
around the world

00:20:36.602 --> 00:20:41.273
will recruit foreign space
businesses to our country.

00:20:42.307 --> 00:20:46.979
Space will be featured during a
select USA conference in June,

00:20:47.512 --> 00:20:52.217
which last year attracted
3,000 foreign participants.

00:20:53.018 --> 00:20:56.955
The department further proposes
to the Space Council

00:20:56.955 --> 00:21:00.826
that all space commerce
responsibilities

00:21:00.826 --> 00:21:04.896
other than launch
and reentry licensing

00:21:04.896 --> 00:21:06.632
be consolidated

00:21:06.632 --> 00:21:08.700
into the Department
of Commerce.

00:21:09.735 --> 00:21:12.337
We further recommend
that the President

00:21:12.337 --> 00:21:15.107
direct the Office
of Space Commerce

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:18.176
to develop in concert
with the Council

00:21:18.176 --> 00:21:22.848
and industry players
regulations and legislation

00:21:22.848 --> 00:21:27.185
for an effective mission
authorization framework

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:30.756
for all commercial
activities in space.

00:21:32.057 --> 00:21:36.361
We pledge to make those
proposals no later than July 1.

00:21:37.596 --> 00:21:41.767
Activities such as asteroid
mining, space tourism,

00:21:41.767 --> 00:21:45.437
and space habitation
are quickly becoming

00:21:45.437 --> 00:21:47.539
much more than
science fiction,

00:21:48.206 --> 00:21:52.644
and we need a future-oriented
space commerce agenda

00:21:52.644 --> 00:21:55.013
and a supportive
regulatory regime.

00:21:55.714 --> 00:21:58.717
With input and guidance
from the Space Council,

00:21:59.251 --> 00:22:00.585
the Department of Commerce

00:22:00.585 --> 00:22:05.791
can be the one-stop shop
the industry so sorely needs.

00:22:07.926 --> 00:22:10.762
In addition, the department
recommends

00:22:10.762 --> 00:22:13.265
that the Departments
of Commerce, State,

00:22:13.265 --> 00:22:18.370
and Defense continue their
efforts to simplify existing

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:22.207
commercial remote
sensing licensing regimes.

00:22:22.808 --> 00:22:26.845
That process must be made
more efficient and predictable.

00:22:27.612 --> 00:22:32.150
Satellite companies now face
a permitting timeline

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:37.189
that can take five years,
is undefined, indefinite,

00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:41.660
and provides no certainty
or predictability to industry.

00:22:42.728 --> 00:22:46.098
This is unacceptable,
and must change.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:52.137
Otherwise, companies and
customers will go overseas.

00:22:52.738 --> 00:22:54.372
There are at least
two other areas

00:22:54.372 --> 00:22:57.375
where Commerce can play
an important role

00:22:57.375 --> 00:22:59.578
for American
leadership in space.

00:23:00.212 --> 00:23:04.082
These are in spectrum policy
and export licensing.

00:23:04.649 --> 00:23:08.653
Spectrum is a scarce resource

00:23:08.653 --> 00:23:12.124
that facilitates
communications control

00:23:12.124 --> 00:23:15.627
and transmission of
valuable data back to Earth.

00:23:16.728 --> 00:23:19.731
The National Space Council
should recommend

00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:22.501
that the department
be directed to develop

00:23:22.501 --> 00:23:26.037
and advocate
for spectrum policies

00:23:26.037 --> 00:23:29.474
to support commercial
space activities,

00:23:29.474 --> 00:23:32.778
while respecting the needs
of DOD and others.

00:23:33.411 --> 00:23:37.616
Finally, Commerce recommends
that the Space Council

00:23:37.616 --> 00:23:41.286
and the executive
secretary review export

00:23:41.286 --> 00:23:43.555
licensing regulations

00:23:43.555 --> 00:23:46.291
affecting commercial
space activity.

00:23:47.459 --> 00:23:52.430
Today, a space vehicle
that returns to earth

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:57.135
in international waters
or non-U.S. territory

00:23:57.135 --> 00:23:59.704
is treated as an export

00:23:59.704 --> 00:24:02.407
of sensitive
and dangerous technology.

00:24:03.141 --> 00:24:08.180
This approach is a primary
complaint of space companies,

00:24:08.814 --> 00:24:12.317
and if the President approves
our recommendations,

00:24:12.317 --> 00:24:16.855
we will continue working with
our colleagues at State and DOD

00:24:16.855 --> 00:24:19.224
to enable more
commercial activity,

00:24:19.724 --> 00:24:21.893
while protecting
national security.

00:24:22.894 --> 00:24:26.464
That little red Tesla
in outer space

00:24:26.464 --> 00:24:28.433
does need rules of the road,

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.871
but there shouldn't be
too many one-way streets,

00:24:32.871 --> 00:24:35.307
dead ends, or u-turns.

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:38.376
I promise you, Commerce
will be a good steward.

00:24:39.644 --> 00:24:41.613
Thank you.

00:24:41.613 --> 00:24:48.954
(Applause.)

00:24:48.954 --> 00:24:50.455
The Vice President:
Well, thank you Wilbur.

00:24:50.455 --> 00:24:52.357
Thank you for your great work

00:24:52.357 --> 00:24:55.460
and the department's
great work in this area

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:59.064
will speak to your
recommendations momentarily.

00:24:59.064 --> 00:25:04.135
But, I think everyone looking on
can tell the great collaboration

00:25:04.135 --> 00:25:06.638
between the Department
of Commerce

00:25:06.638 --> 00:25:07.939
and the Department
of Transportation,

00:25:08.807 --> 00:25:10.508
and appreciate
so very much the work done.

00:25:11.476 --> 00:25:15.413
We'll turn our attention
now to Administrator Rao.

00:25:17.015 --> 00:25:18.650
Thank you for being here today.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:21.286
Most people may not be aware
of how important your job

00:25:21.286 --> 00:25:26.458
is to this industry at the
Office of Management and Budget.

00:25:26.458 --> 00:25:28.059
You lead the Office
of Information

00:25:28.059 --> 00:25:29.327
and Regulatory Affairs.

00:25:29.327 --> 00:25:30.996
It's critical to the work
of this Council.

00:25:30.996 --> 00:25:32.530
I want to thank
Director Mulvaney,

00:25:33.798 --> 00:25:36.768
who has been working tirelessly
to move the President's agenda,

00:25:36.768 --> 00:25:38.603
and streamlining
regulatory regimes.

00:25:38.603 --> 00:25:41.239
Could you give us
a quick overview

00:25:41.239 --> 00:25:43.541
of what you have
been working for,

00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:46.678
working toward in the office
to support this effort?

00:25:46.678 --> 00:25:49.014
Administrator Rao:
Sure, thank you

00:25:49.014 --> 00:25:50.348
very much, Mr. Vice President.

00:25:50.348 --> 00:25:52.417
It's a pleasure to be here
with members of the Cabinet,

00:25:52.417 --> 00:25:54.819
the Space Council,
and other distinguished guests

00:25:54.819 --> 00:25:57.222
for this very exciting
and ambitious event.

00:25:58.223 --> 00:26:01.226
So, as you mentioned,
I'm the administrator at OIRA,

00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:03.094
which is the office that reviews

00:26:03.094 --> 00:26:04.796
all the significant regulatory

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:06.298
actions across the government.

00:26:06.998 --> 00:26:08.767
And in a nutshell,
what we really do

00:26:08.767 --> 00:26:10.669
is we try to ensure
that regulations

00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:12.003
serve the American people.

00:26:12.804 --> 00:26:15.173
And since the Reagan
administration,

00:26:15.173 --> 00:26:18.043
we help agencies meet
presidential priorities

00:26:18.043 --> 00:26:20.312
such as what we're
talking about today;

00:26:20.312 --> 00:26:23.348
the commitment to winning
the next frontier of space.

00:26:24.616 --> 00:26:26.418
So, Mr. Vice President,
as you've already said

00:26:26.418 --> 00:26:29.788
so well there are tremendous
opportunities here to use space

00:26:29.788 --> 00:26:32.157
for security
and commercial purposes.

00:26:33.024 --> 00:26:34.926
But the success of these
ambitious ventures

00:26:34.926 --> 00:26:37.262
will depend in part
on a regulatory system

00:26:37.262 --> 00:26:39.764
that does not stand
in the way of progress

00:26:39.764 --> 00:26:42.834
but, instead, enables
innovation, provides clarity,

00:26:42.834 --> 00:26:45.270
and ensures safety.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.572
These goals with respect
to space development

00:26:47.572 --> 00:26:50.709
are consistent with President
Trump's overall direction

00:26:50.709 --> 00:26:53.511
to reduce cumulative
regulatory burdens

00:26:53.511 --> 00:26:55.213
across the government.

00:26:55.213 --> 00:26:58.049
As an administration, we want
to advance a regulatory --

00:26:58.049 --> 00:27:01.886
(audio break)

00:27:01.886 --> 00:27:04.289
and that leaves
individuals and businesses

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:06.624
as free as possible to innovate

00:27:06.624 --> 00:27:09.027
and to create the
technology of the future.

00:27:10.528 --> 00:27:12.797
These general principles
apply across the board,

00:27:12.797 --> 00:27:14.632
but really have
particular importance

00:27:14.632 --> 00:27:16.368
in areas of
emerging technology,

00:27:16.368 --> 00:27:17.869
such as space exploration.

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.939
And here we start
with the basic idea

00:27:20.939 --> 00:27:22.807
that government shouldn't
be picking winners

00:27:22.807 --> 00:27:24.576
and losers through regulation.

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:27.045
We don't want
to regulate in a way

00:27:27.045 --> 00:27:29.514
that freezes
technological development

00:27:29.514 --> 00:27:32.217
or stifles innovation through
government prescriptions.

00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:35.987
And as Secretary Ross
and Deputy Secretary Rosen

00:27:35.987 --> 00:27:38.690
have already mentioned,
important reform begins

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:41.059
first by identifying
some of the problems

00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:43.294
with existing
regulatory frameworks.

00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:46.398
We need to find those
regulations that are

00:27:46.398 --> 00:27:48.133
duplicative, outdated,

00:27:48.133 --> 00:27:50.035
or just simply ineffective

00:27:50.035 --> 00:27:53.338
and then work hard to eliminate
or streamline those burdens.

00:27:54.672 --> 00:27:57.042
And in areas where
multiple agencies impose

00:27:57.042 --> 00:27:58.443
overlapping burdens

00:27:58.443 --> 00:28:01.513
such as in licensing
or paperwork reporting,

00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:03.848
we are reconsidering
how those requirements

00:28:03.848 --> 00:28:05.683
can be combined or replaced.

00:28:06.284 --> 00:28:09.487
And in part because of because
of our centralized role at OIRA,

00:28:09.487 --> 00:28:12.290
we can address issues
that span multiple agencies

00:28:13.258 --> 00:28:16.795
to eliminate and streamline
unnecessary requirements.

00:28:17.595 --> 00:28:19.831
And that simply will
allow more resources

00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:22.534
to be devoted to
research and production,

00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:24.469
rather than regulatory red tape.

00:28:26.137 --> 00:28:28.573
And we're confident that we can
do this for space development

00:28:28.573 --> 00:28:30.842
because we've done this
in other regulatory areas.

00:28:31.376 --> 00:28:34.612
The President has demonstrated

00:28:34.612 --> 00:28:36.581
tremendous leadership
in this area,

00:28:36.581 --> 00:28:39.017
and directed significant
and meaningful regulatory

00:28:39.017 --> 00:28:41.753
reform since the outset
of the administration.

00:28:42.754 --> 00:28:45.056
His early executive order
called for eliminating

00:28:45.056 --> 00:28:46.991
two regulations
for each new one,

00:28:47.826 --> 00:28:49.160
and as of the last
fiscal year,

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.263
we were actually at
22 deregulatory actions

00:28:52.263 --> 00:28:53.665
for each new one.

00:28:53.665 --> 00:28:55.834
And in this coming year
agencies have proposed

00:28:55.834 --> 00:28:57.735
even more deregulatory actions

00:28:57.735 --> 00:28:59.204
and projecting a regulatory

00:28:59.204 --> 00:29:01.206
cost savings of
over $10 billion.

00:29:03.141 --> 00:29:04.976
So, in the past,
regulatory burdens

00:29:04.976 --> 00:29:06.811
have steadily
increased over time.

00:29:07.412 --> 00:29:09.914
But this administration
has really turned the tide

00:29:09.914 --> 00:29:12.183
with its regulatory
reform initiatives.

00:29:13.151 --> 00:29:16.721
And so, in areas
of burgeoning technology

00:29:16.721 --> 00:29:18.423
such as space development,

00:29:18.423 --> 00:29:20.358
this means individuals
and companies

00:29:20.358 --> 00:29:21.860
can proceed with confidence

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:25.029
that we're not going to spring
new regulatory requirements

00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:26.531
on them that will stifle growth.

00:29:27.398 --> 00:29:29.934
We want to contribute
to a regulatory environment

00:29:29.934 --> 00:29:31.736
that can enhance
development of space,

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:35.006
and with the right
frameworks we're confident

00:29:35.006 --> 00:29:36.741
that private companies
can unleash

00:29:36.741 --> 00:29:38.276
creativity and ingenuity.

00:29:39.144 --> 00:29:41.813
And we can enhance
American global leadership

00:29:41.813 --> 00:29:44.048
by attracting
investments in research

00:29:44.048 --> 00:29:45.517
and development for space.

00:29:45.517 --> 00:29:48.786
Of course, with further
advances into space,

00:29:48.786 --> 00:29:51.189
we face important
questions about security,

00:29:51.189 --> 00:29:52.757
safety, sovereignty.

00:29:53.391 --> 00:29:55.360
But, with the work
of the Space Council,

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.763
OIRA remains committed
to working across the government

00:29:58.763 --> 00:30:01.933
to design regulations
that meet these needs,

00:30:01.933 --> 00:30:04.736
while furthering our journey
to the next frontiers of space.

00:30:05.403 --> 00:30:07.405
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

00:30:08.673 --> 00:30:09.240
The Vice President:
Thank you, Neomi.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.909
(Applause.)

00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:15.113
Well done. Okay.

00:30:15.113 --> 00:30:17.282
This -- we're approaching
the end

00:30:17.282 --> 00:30:19.150
of the first half
of our presentation.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:21.853
Before we move to panels,
I would recommend, members,

00:30:21.853 --> 00:30:23.188
in your packets today

00:30:24.656 --> 00:30:28.993
you have several recommendations
to the President for approval.

00:30:29.961 --> 00:30:31.629
Recommendation One directs
the Department

00:30:31.629 --> 00:30:34.599
of Transportation
to direct --

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:39.103
to replace prescriptive launch
and reentry licensing regimes

00:30:39.103 --> 00:30:43.074
with a streamlined system
by March 1, 2019,

00:30:43.074 --> 00:30:45.310
to be completed at
that point on or before.

00:30:45.843 --> 00:30:48.079
Recommendation Two directs
the Department of Commerce

00:30:48.079 --> 00:30:51.616
to consolidate all space
commerce responsibilities

00:30:53.218 --> 00:30:54.886
in the Office
of the Secretary,

00:30:56.888 --> 00:30:58.823
as Wilbur described,

00:30:58.823 --> 00:31:02.060
and also develop a system that 
facilitates mission authorization

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.596
for commercial
space activities.

00:31:04.596 --> 00:31:07.865
There are other recommendations
related to that

00:31:07.865 --> 00:31:10.735
that the Secretary
enumerated quite well.

00:31:10.735 --> 00:31:14.505
Recommendation Three directs
the National Telecommunication

00:31:14.505 --> 00:31:15.773
Information Administration

00:31:16.574 --> 00:31:18.476
and Commerce
to work with the FCC

00:31:18.476 --> 00:31:22.580
to develop protections for
the radio frequency spectrum,

00:31:23.915 --> 00:31:26.317
facilitating commercial
space activities.

00:31:27.018 --> 00:31:28.486
And Recommendation Four directs

00:31:28.486 --> 00:31:30.288
the Executive Secretary
of the Council,

00:31:30.288 --> 00:31:32.357
in coordination with all
members of the Council,

00:31:33.057 --> 00:31:34.926
to develop recommendations
to streamline

00:31:34.926 --> 00:31:38.630
export control
regulatory requirements

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:41.432
by 1st of January 2019,

00:31:41.432 --> 00:31:43.968
also as the Secretary described.

00:31:43.968 --> 00:31:49.440
If there are no objections
or questions,

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.776
seeing none,
I would, as Chairman,

00:31:51.776 --> 00:31:53.177
direct the Executive Secretary

00:31:53.177 --> 00:31:56.314
to include these recommendations
in a decision memorandum

00:31:56.314 --> 00:31:57.915
for the President
of the United States.

00:31:59.684 --> 00:32:02.120
Secretary Ross
and Deputy Secretary Rosen,

00:32:03.054 --> 00:32:05.957
at our meeting later this year,
I'd also like you to support --

00:32:05.957 --> 00:32:08.259
or report to the Council
the details of the progress

00:32:08.259 --> 00:32:13.965
so that we are making against
the President's decision

00:32:13.965 --> 00:32:16.834
in completion of
the decision memorandum.

00:32:16.834 --> 00:32:19.470
Will you join me in thanking
all of these terrific leaders

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:21.139
for the job
that they're doing --

00:32:21.139 --> 00:32:27.879
(Applause.)

00:32:27.879 --> 00:32:29.147
Well, before we call
our panel up,

00:32:29.147 --> 00:32:31.683
we're going to move
to our first panel entitled

00:32:31.683 --> 00:32:37.755
"Securing the Next Frontier with
a Focus on National Security,"

00:32:37.755 --> 00:32:42.260
and I'm particularly
pleased to have

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.195
a number of
distinguished Americans

00:32:44.195 --> 00:32:47.198
who will be presenting, and I'll
introduce them momentarily,

00:32:47.198 --> 00:32:49.634
but they're invited
to take their seats.

00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:51.169
Before we hear
from our panelists,

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:56.774
I'd like to ask
Susan Gordon, who I have --

00:32:57.408 --> 00:33:00.778
and the President have come
to know and greatly respect.

00:33:00.778 --> 00:33:03.748
She is the Principle
Deputy Director

00:33:03.748 --> 00:33:05.917
for National Intelligence
for the United States.

00:33:05.917 --> 00:33:07.819
And Susan, maybe
you could give us

00:33:08.753 --> 00:33:11.622
a brief overview of
the security challenges

00:33:11.622 --> 00:33:13.424
that the United States faces

00:33:14.258 --> 00:33:15.493
in the space environment today.

00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:18.196
Deputy Director Gordon: Well,
thank you, Mr. Vice President.

00:33:18.796 --> 00:33:20.064
I'm delighted to be here today

00:33:20.064 --> 00:33:22.900
representing the women and men
of the intelligence community.

00:33:23.434 --> 00:33:27.105
You know, we are drivers,
and practitioners,

00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:29.741
and users of U.S. space.

00:33:30.641 --> 00:33:34.612
In fact, our history and space
history are inextricably bound.

00:33:35.146 --> 00:33:36.881
And we see the same excitement

00:33:36.881 --> 00:33:40.151
that you articulated in your
remarks about this moment.

00:33:40.785 --> 00:33:43.121
And they're resplendent
with opportunity even at --

00:33:43.121 --> 00:33:46.824
(audio break)

00:33:46.824 --> 00:33:47.925
-- Vice President.

00:33:47.925 --> 00:33:49.627
As your resident
intelligence officer,

00:33:49.627 --> 00:33:53.631
I often bring the sobering
information to any meeting.

00:33:53.631 --> 00:33:56.801
And so today what I thought
I'd do is to spend a few minutes

00:33:56.801 --> 00:33:58.069
and just describe the plans

00:33:58.069 --> 00:33:59.771
and actions of foreign
adversaries

00:33:59.771 --> 00:34:03.975
and competitors who would seek
to impede our operations

00:34:03.975 --> 00:34:05.743
or challenge our advantage.

00:34:06.511 --> 00:34:08.880
Russia and China are each
developing counter-space

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.849
capabilities to use during 
a potential future conflict

00:34:11.849 --> 00:34:14.252
with the United States
to reduce U.S.

00:34:14.252 --> 00:34:16.754
and allied advantage
and effectiveness,

00:34:16.754 --> 00:34:19.223
eroding our
information advantage.

00:34:20.124 --> 00:34:22.427
Both countries
have robust jamming

00:34:22.427 --> 00:34:24.862
and cyber-attack
capabilities today

00:34:24.862 --> 00:34:27.131
and can threaten our satellite
ground infrastructure.

00:34:28.099 --> 00:34:31.035
Russian and China destructive
anti-satellite weapons,

00:34:31.035 --> 00:34:35.273
including missiles, lasers,
and orbital weapons,

00:34:35.273 --> 00:34:38.576
will probably reach initial
operation capability

00:34:38.576 --> 00:34:39.844
in the next few years.

00:34:40.878 --> 00:34:42.680
Russian lawmakers have promoted

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.750
military pursuit
of anti-satellite missiles

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:48.286
to strike low-earth-orbiting
satellites,

00:34:48.986 --> 00:34:50.655
and Russia is testing
such a weapon.

00:34:52.056 --> 00:34:54.425
Both Russia and China
are developing laser

00:34:54.425 --> 00:34:56.327
anti-satellite weapons to dazzle

00:34:56.327 --> 00:34:59.230
or damage sensitive
space-based optical sensors,

00:34:59.964 --> 00:35:03.000
and Russia and China continue
to conduct sophisticated

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.769
on-orbit activities,

00:35:04.769 --> 00:35:08.339
such as rendezvous
and proximity operations

00:35:08.339 --> 00:35:11.309
that are intended to advance
counter-space capabilities.

00:35:12.577 --> 00:35:14.512
Military reforms
in China and Russia

00:35:14.512 --> 00:35:17.815
over the past few years
indicate an increased focus

00:35:17.815 --> 00:35:21.352
on establishing
operational airspace forces

00:35:21.352 --> 00:35:24.889
and integrating attacks against
space systems and services

00:35:24.889 --> 00:35:27.325
with military operations
in other domains.

00:35:28.593 --> 00:35:30.294
China's People's Liberation Army

00:35:30.294 --> 00:35:33.197
has formed counter-space
military units

00:35:33.865 --> 00:35:37.435
and begun operational training
with counter-space systems,

00:35:37.435 --> 00:35:39.971
including the ground-launched
anti-satellite missile

00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:42.273
that was initially
tested in 2007.

00:35:44.108 --> 00:35:47.144
Now, the idea of space threats
also includes the use of space

00:35:47.144 --> 00:35:49.814
to enable or empower
military operations

00:35:51.415 --> 00:35:53.384
on the earth's surface.

00:35:53.384 --> 00:35:55.453
Foreign countries
will continue to improve

00:35:55.453 --> 00:35:58.656
their military and dual-use
reconnaissance, communications,

00:35:58.656 --> 00:36:00.558
and navigation systems,

00:36:00.558 --> 00:36:02.393
in terms of the numbers
of satellites,

00:36:02.393 --> 00:36:05.162
the breadth of their capability,
and the application for use.

00:36:06.163 --> 00:36:08.533
Another nation-state
and non-state actors

00:36:08.533 --> 00:36:12.169
will gain access to advanced
space-enabled technology

00:36:12.169 --> 00:36:16.073
in the coming years as the
global space industry expands.

00:36:17.141 --> 00:36:20.177
They will increasingly
have access to weather,

00:36:20.177 --> 00:36:23.047
communications, navigation,
and timing data for intelligence

00:36:23.047 --> 00:36:25.516
and military purposes.

00:36:25.516 --> 00:36:28.786
The panel will do a great job
of making my next point,

00:36:28.786 --> 00:36:32.456
but I'll briefly state that I'd
like to call the attention

00:36:32.456 --> 00:36:34.759
to China's impressive rise,

00:36:34.759 --> 00:36:36.594
and it is impressive
as a space power.

00:36:37.395 --> 00:36:40.231
They have increased the number
of their active satellites

00:36:40.231 --> 00:36:42.900
by more than an order
of magnitude since 2000,

00:36:43.668 --> 00:36:46.203
and a result of Beijing's
strong investment

00:36:46.203 --> 00:36:48.773
in its satellite and rocket
manufacturing capability.

00:36:49.974 --> 00:36:51.909
China's satellite technology

00:36:51.909 --> 00:36:53.844
has become increasingly
sophisticated,

00:36:54.378 --> 00:36:57.281
and a case in point is the
success that China has had --

00:36:57.281 --> 00:36:59.984
achieved in world-leading
ground-to-space

00:36:59.984 --> 00:37:01.919
quantum communications
experiments.

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:07.625
I think, in sum, China has
the best politically supported

00:37:08.492 --> 00:37:10.828
and best resourced
foreign space program

00:37:11.562 --> 00:37:13.297
that we have seen
in many years.

00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:15.967
And its years
of intense activity

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:17.168
are beginning to bear fruit.

00:37:18.369 --> 00:37:22.807
I think the panel is
perfectly placed to help us

00:37:22.807 --> 00:37:24.041
put all this in context.

00:37:24.041 --> 00:37:25.343
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:27.511
The Vice President:
Great, thank you, Susan.

00:37:27.511 --> 00:37:29.447
(Applause.)

00:37:29.447 --> 00:37:36.320
Very insightful. Sue's a great
American, and thank you.

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:40.224
Thank you for that candid
and bracing overview.

00:37:40.224 --> 00:37:41.492
With that, we'll turn
to our panelists.

00:37:43.227 --> 00:37:46.564
Let me introduce all of them and
then invite you to welcome then.

00:37:47.098 --> 00:37:49.700
Mr. Dean Cheng is with
the Heritage Foundation;

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.402
Mr. Jeffrey Manber
is the President

00:37:51.402 --> 00:37:53.571
and CEO of
NanoRocks Corporation;

00:37:54.171 --> 00:37:58.376
our third panelist
is Dr. Bhavya Lal

00:37:58.376 --> 00:38:00.778
of the Institute
of Defense Analysis,

00:38:00.778 --> 00:38:03.814
Science, and Technology
Policy Institute.

00:38:03.814 --> 00:38:06.384
Join me in welcoming all of
our panelists, would you please?

00:38:06.384 --> 00:38:07.418
Thank you all.

00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:11.889
(Applause.)

00:38:11.889 --> 00:38:14.725
I'd like to invite,
starting with Dean Cheng,

00:38:14.725 --> 00:38:17.628
I'd like to invite you
to bring a few brief remarks

00:38:17.628 --> 00:38:20.064
but, of course, all
of your prepared remarks

00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:21.599
will be submitted
to the public record.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.236
And then we'll look
forward to briefly

00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:27.772
giving our Council members

00:38:27.772 --> 00:38:29.140
an opportunity
to ask questions.

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:31.142
But thank you all
for being here.

00:38:33.277 --> 00:38:34.545
Mr. Cheng: Good morning,
Mr. Vice President,

00:38:34.545 --> 00:38:36.247
members of the Space Council,

00:38:36.247 --> 00:38:38.382
the National Space Council.
My name is Dean Cheng.

00:38:38.382 --> 00:38:41.018
The views I express
in this testimony are my own;

00:38:41.018 --> 00:38:43.387
they should not be construed as
reflecting the official position

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:45.056
of the Heritage Foundation.

00:38:45.056 --> 00:38:47.692
During the Cold War, there were
only two major space powers,

00:38:47.692 --> 00:38:49.660
the United States
and the Soviet Union,

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.696
and they had roughly
symmetric interests

00:38:51.696 --> 00:38:52.930
and approaches to space.

00:38:53.497 --> 00:38:54.965
Like so much of
international security,

00:38:54.965 --> 00:38:57.835
the post-Cold War world
is much more complex.

00:38:57.835 --> 00:38:59.603
There are more
space players today,

00:38:59.603 --> 00:39:02.873
including a growing set of
non-state and commercial actors.

00:39:03.507 --> 00:39:05.376
At the same,
the American dependence

00:39:05.376 --> 00:39:06.644
on space has broadened.

00:39:06.644 --> 00:39:09.980
The U.S. military depends
upon space-based systems

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.215
for the American
way of war.

00:39:11.782 --> 00:39:13.584
Financial institutions, farmers,

00:39:13.584 --> 00:39:16.754
and Amazon all increasingly
depend on space systems

00:39:16.754 --> 00:39:18.656
for their day-to-day operations.

00:39:18.656 --> 00:39:20.157
Given this dependence,

00:39:20.157 --> 00:39:23.194
revisionist powers
and security competitors

00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:25.963
are likely to target
American space systems

00:39:25.963 --> 00:39:28.933
as an essential means
of countering American economic

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:30.301
and military capability.

00:39:31.068 --> 00:39:32.837
This evolving set
of circumstances

00:39:32.837 --> 00:39:35.005
for both space
and American security

00:39:35.005 --> 00:39:36.974
is reflected in
the growing challenge

00:39:36.974 --> 00:39:38.776
posed by the other space powers,

00:39:38.776 --> 00:39:40.711
and especially the People's
Republic of China.

00:39:41.645 --> 00:39:43.814
The PRC has pursued
a set of space policies

00:39:43.814 --> 00:39:48.452
that do not parallel
American or Soviet ones,

00:39:48.452 --> 00:39:51.655
and it is now exploiting
not only new technologies

00:39:51.655 --> 00:39:53.724
to expand
its space capabilities,

00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:57.328
but also taking new
organizational approaches

00:39:57.328 --> 00:39:58.763
and innovations.

00:39:58.763 --> 00:40:01.398
Some of the key characteristics
of the Chinese space challenge

00:40:01.398 --> 00:40:03.033
include, first and foremost,

00:40:03.033 --> 00:40:06.837
that China is fundamentally
a major space power.

00:40:06.837 --> 00:40:08.773
China possesses all of
the key elements

00:40:08.773 --> 00:40:11.509
required for supporting
a major space presence.

00:40:11.509 --> 00:40:14.278
Above all, it has the political
will to support

00:40:14.278 --> 00:40:17.014
and sustain national
commitments to space.

00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:20.284
China has also committed
the industrial, financial,

00:40:20.284 --> 00:40:23.521
and human capital
to translate those desires

00:40:23.521 --> 00:40:26.423
into today's array
of satellites, boosters,

00:40:26.423 --> 00:40:28.159
and launch sites,

00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:30.494
and it is important to note
that those systems

00:40:30.494 --> 00:40:33.697
are largely indigenously
designed and constructed.

00:40:34.198 --> 00:40:37.601
China may engage in all sorts
of industrial espionage,

00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:41.305
but much of its space program
is indigenous and homegrown.

00:40:42.206 --> 00:40:45.042
China's space program has
a very heavy military component.

00:40:45.609 --> 00:40:47.011
The basic reality is that

00:40:47.011 --> 00:40:49.113
when we interact with
China's space program,

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:52.082
we are essentially interacting
with China's military.

00:40:52.683 --> 00:40:54.718
China's space
facilities, personnel,

00:40:54.718 --> 00:40:57.688
and programs are largely drawn
from that military.

00:40:57.688 --> 00:41:02.393
Its facilities are PLA bases,
their staffs are PLA personnel,

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:03.694
and the heads of key programs,

00:41:03.694 --> 00:41:06.797
such as the China Manned
Space Engineering Office,

00:41:06.797 --> 00:41:08.499
are drawn from the military.

00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:10.668
China's space program, however,

00:41:10.668 --> 00:41:13.103
also reflects
its approach of dual-use

00:41:13.103 --> 00:41:14.805
as civil/military integration.

00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:19.143
China's space industrial complex
is not so much a revolving door

00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:22.580
as a broad atrium for Chinese
air and space engineers

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:26.083
and managers amidst all of these
state-owned enterprises.

00:41:26.083 --> 00:41:29.887
And the result is far closer
to a single integrated space

00:41:29.887 --> 00:41:32.923
enterprise with relatively
few demarcations

00:41:32.923 --> 00:41:34.658
between the military
and civilian.

00:41:35.526 --> 00:41:37.928
This reality will likely
apply to China's

00:41:37.928 --> 00:41:41.365
emerging set of commercial
space entities as well.

00:41:41.365 --> 00:41:43.734
China is actually
promoting the development

00:41:43.734 --> 00:41:45.970
of new commercial
space companies

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:48.839
that range from those supported
by state-owned enterprises

00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:50.708
to more independent
private firms.

00:41:51.275 --> 00:41:53.677
But given the interest
in melding civilian

00:41:53.677 --> 00:41:55.646
and military capacity,

00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:59.250
as well as past evidence
behavior in the telecomm sector,

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:02.920
it is vital to recognize
that these private firms will,

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.422
at the end of the day,
respond with alacrity

00:42:05.422 --> 00:42:06.991
to central government
directives.

00:42:07.558 --> 00:42:10.761
The Chinese model will not
be Teslas in space,

00:42:10.761 --> 00:42:12.529
but Huawei in space.

00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:16.000
In conclusion, as the
United States advances space

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.035
as a priority domain,

00:42:18.035 --> 00:42:20.938
it needs to recognize that other
states will not only set --

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:23.440
seek to do the same
for themselves,

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.943
but some are also
very likely to strive

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:30.314
to deny space to the
United States in time of crisis,

00:42:30.314 --> 00:42:31.649
and certainly in time of war.

00:42:32.182 --> 00:42:33.651
These efforts
will likely encompass

00:42:33.651 --> 00:42:35.686
not only direct military action

00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:39.023
but efforts at establishing
a highly competitive space

00:42:39.023 --> 00:42:40.291
industrial base

00:42:40.291 --> 00:42:42.626
supporting space-oriented
technologies,

00:42:42.626 --> 00:42:45.195
production,
and organizational innovation,

00:42:45.195 --> 00:42:47.097
and undertaking
an array of efforts

00:42:47.097 --> 00:42:49.166
to access American technologies

00:42:49.166 --> 00:42:51.268
while denying the
United States the same.

00:42:51.268 --> 00:42:52.870
Thank you very much
for the opportunity to testify

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:53.704
before you this morning.

00:42:53.704 --> 00:42:54.838
(Applause.)

00:42:54.838 --> 00:42:56.840
The Vice President:
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

00:43:00.377 --> 00:43:03.013
Jeffery Manber, with
NanoRocks Corporation;

00:43:03.013 --> 00:43:04.515
thank you for being here.
You're recognized.

00:43:04.515 --> 00:43:05.783
Mr. Manber:
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

00:43:06.283 --> 00:43:08.986
Now, for 30 years --
good morning, everyone.

00:43:08.986 --> 00:43:11.455
For 30 years,
I've worked to make space

00:43:11.455 --> 00:43:13.657
just another place
to do business.

00:43:14.158 --> 00:43:17.761
My inspiration, in large part,
derives from having worked

00:43:17.761 --> 00:43:21.098
under Ronald Reagan's Commerce
Secretary Malcolm Baldridge

00:43:21.098 --> 00:43:23.167
in the original Office
of Space Commerce,

00:43:23.167 --> 00:43:24.768
so it's good to be here
this morning.

00:43:25.602 --> 00:43:28.205
I started my company,
NanoRocks, eight years ago.

00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:31.141
We were the first company
to own and market

00:43:31.141 --> 00:43:32.676
our own research services

00:43:32.676 --> 00:43:34.144
on board the space station.

00:43:34.845 --> 00:43:37.982
We were the first company
to commercially deploy small

00:43:37.982 --> 00:43:39.717
(inaudible)
the space station.

00:43:39.717 --> 00:43:43.153
As of today, we have
launched over 600 payloads

00:43:43.153 --> 00:43:45.556
from customers
in over 30 countries.

00:43:46.223 --> 00:43:48.092
Our commercial customers range

00:43:48.092 --> 00:43:50.928
from the U.S. government
to high schools.

00:43:51.528 --> 00:43:54.531
The U.S. government is
a commercial customer;

00:43:54.531 --> 00:43:57.234
so, too, the high schools,
some of whom do bake sales

00:43:57.234 --> 00:43:59.269
to support the payloads
that go to station.

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:02.439
And I'm proud to say,
Mr. Vice President,

00:44:02.439 --> 00:44:04.808
that we've launched four
high school experiments

00:44:04.808 --> 00:44:07.211
from Crown Point
and Highland, Indiana.

00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:11.515
So, please allow me several
observations this morning.

00:44:11.515 --> 00:44:13.484
First, kudos to
the administration

00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:16.220
and the council beginning
the debate today

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.723
on the transition from the ISS,

00:44:19.723 --> 00:44:21.692
from a government-owned
facility,

00:44:21.692 --> 00:44:24.094
to an era of private
space stations.

00:44:25.029 --> 00:44:27.998
The debate may have been
skewed a bit in the headlines,

00:44:28.899 --> 00:44:31.635
but I believe you are raising
the correct questions.

00:44:32.436 --> 00:44:40.177
How can NASA most effectively
leverage the taxpayer

00:44:40.177 --> 00:44:41.912
investment in ISS?

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.582
Can commercial industry safely

00:44:45.582 --> 00:44:48.452
and cost effectively
operate the ISS

00:44:48.452 --> 00:44:50.454
in other commercial platforms?

00:44:51.021 --> 00:44:53.624
And we understand,
it's not black and white,

00:44:54.425 --> 00:44:56.894
but it is an end to accepting

00:44:56.894 --> 00:44:59.163
that the government
support of ISS

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:01.031
is the only pathway,

00:45:01.031 --> 00:45:02.900
and how will the government,
in the future,

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:05.335
behave more and more
as a tenant,

00:45:05.335 --> 00:45:07.738
just the way it is
in every other marketplace?

00:45:07.738 --> 00:45:09.506
So, we're very excited by this.

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:13.911
Finally, as I look overseas,
it's my opinion,

00:45:13.911 --> 00:45:17.247
as a businessman,
as a space businessman,

00:45:17.247 --> 00:45:20.084
that the United States
cannot simply ignore

00:45:20.084 --> 00:45:22.986
China's commercial
space ambitions.

00:45:22.986 --> 00:45:25.389
Commercial space ambitions.

00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:27.524
China is quietly developing

00:45:27.524 --> 00:45:29.827
a robust commercial
space industry.

00:45:30.427 --> 00:45:33.964
I say "quietly" because
Americans are barred,

00:45:33.964 --> 00:45:37.734
by our own regulations,
and our own mindset,

00:45:37.734 --> 00:45:40.337
from participation
in this marketplace.

00:45:40.938 --> 00:45:43.307
As we just heard,
large Chinese companies

00:45:43.307 --> 00:45:45.309
are creating commercial
launch efforts,

00:45:45.876 --> 00:45:48.745
while young Chinese
entrepreneurs are raising funds

00:45:48.745 --> 00:45:50.547
from Silicon Valley

00:45:50.547 --> 00:45:52.850
on commercial
space projects.

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:56.253
On a governmental level,
our allies have noticed.

00:45:56.253 --> 00:45:59.156
The European Space Agency
has astronauts training

00:45:59.156 --> 00:46:01.325
to visit the planned
Chinese space station.

00:46:01.825 --> 00:46:05.496
But the U.S. has barred itself
from participation.

00:46:06.563 --> 00:46:08.532
NanoRocks and other companies

00:46:08.532 --> 00:46:11.268
are prohibited to sell
into this marketplace.

00:46:11.835 --> 00:46:14.338
Avoiding this
emerging marketplace,

00:46:14.338 --> 00:46:19.009
albeit to justified concerns
over technology transfer

00:46:19.009 --> 00:46:21.178
and other legitimate issues,

00:46:21.178 --> 00:46:23.614
is not the American
global leadership

00:46:23.614 --> 00:46:25.349
that we all strive to achieve.

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:28.752
Now, while my time
today is brief,

00:46:28.752 --> 00:46:33.891
I urge us to negotiate a stern
but fair agreement with China

00:46:33.891 --> 00:46:37.294
and allow U.S. businesses
to do what we do best,

00:46:37.294 --> 00:46:40.364
and that is to innovate and
compete better than anyone else.

00:46:41.031 --> 00:46:43.767
Mr. Vice President,
and members of the council,

00:46:44.301 --> 00:46:46.270
I am thrilled that
the administration

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:48.305
is focusing on commercial space,

00:46:48.305 --> 00:46:52.276
a part of America's leadership
in space exploration.

00:46:52.276 --> 00:46:55.746
Through the American-style
commercial pathway,

00:46:55.746 --> 00:46:58.382
I am certain we will
continue to inspire

00:46:58.382 --> 00:47:00.784
the next generation
of explorers,

00:47:00.784 --> 00:47:04.454
so that one day, those students
from Crown Point, Indiana,

00:47:04.454 --> 00:47:07.791
will be standing in front
of a future space council

00:47:08.759 --> 00:47:12.095
discussing how the United States
commercial lunar base

00:47:12.095 --> 00:47:14.031
is just another place
to do business.

00:47:14.031 --> 00:47:16.033
So, thank you.

00:47:16.033 --> 00:47:22.706
(Applause.)

00:47:22.706 --> 00:47:24.274
The Vice President:
Thank you, Jeffery; well said.

00:47:24.942 --> 00:47:27.811
And Bhavya Lal recognized,

00:47:27.811 --> 00:47:29.112
and then we'll move
on to questions

00:47:29.112 --> 00:47:31.114
after your presentation.

00:47:31.114 --> 00:47:32.716
Ms. Lal: Good morning,
Mr. Vice President,

00:47:32.716 --> 00:47:34.985
and members of
the National Space Council.

00:47:35.586 --> 00:47:37.487
A discussion
on the threats to U.S.

00:47:37.487 --> 00:47:41.792
competitiveness in space needs
to start with acknowledgment

00:47:41.792 --> 00:47:44.595
that we are the preeminent space
power in the world today.

00:47:45.395 --> 00:47:48.298
The U.S. government
still spends more on space

00:47:48.298 --> 00:47:50.200
than the rest of the governments
in the world combined.

00:47:50.867 --> 00:47:53.403
The United States has more
satellites and other assets

00:47:53.403 --> 00:47:55.772
in orbit than any other
country in the world.

00:47:56.373 --> 00:47:59.109
The world's current
most powerful rocket

00:47:59.109 --> 00:48:02.746
launch just two weeks ago is
a product of American industry.

00:48:03.413 --> 00:48:04.948
A recent study in global trends

00:48:04.948 --> 00:48:06.984
in small satellites
by my organization,

00:48:06.984 --> 00:48:09.119
the IDA Science and Technology
Policy Institute,

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:12.389
found that about two thirds
of the hundred organizations

00:48:12.389 --> 00:48:14.024
doing the most
innovative R&amp;D

00:48:14.024 --> 00:48:16.526
in the small-sat sector
are U.S.-based.

00:48:17.361 --> 00:48:20.430
These advantages, however,
cannot be taken for granted,

00:48:20.964 --> 00:48:24.735
and our leadership in space is
increasingly being challenged.

00:48:25.469 --> 00:48:28.105
Global investments in space
have steadily grown

00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:29.873
over the past two decades.

00:48:29.873 --> 00:48:33.076
A decade ago, for instance,
fewer than 50 countries

00:48:33.076 --> 00:48:35.812
were investing about
40 billion dollars in space.

00:48:36.413 --> 00:48:41.051
By 2026, 30 more countries are
expected to join the space club,

00:48:41.051 --> 00:48:42.986
and global expenditures
are expected

00:48:42.986 --> 00:48:45.055
to double those
of 10 years ago.

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:48.392
Growing
international expenditure

00:48:48.392 --> 00:48:50.594
is only one development
in the space sector.

00:48:51.328 --> 00:48:53.130
Partially as a result
of investments

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:55.132
from the U.S. government,

00:48:55.132 --> 00:48:57.534
there have been dramatic
improvements in the technology

00:48:57.534 --> 00:48:59.136
used in the space sector.

00:48:59.136 --> 00:49:02.239
In some areas, costs have
fallen orders of magnitude.

00:49:03.106 --> 00:49:05.475
Using a combination
of alternative architectures,

00:49:05.475 --> 00:49:07.744
such as swarms of
hundreds of satellites,

00:49:07.744 --> 00:49:09.713
and business process innovation,

00:49:09.713 --> 00:49:13.150
relatively inexpensive
breadbox-sized satellites

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:16.186
are able to nearly
match services

00:49:16.186 --> 00:49:19.890
that were previously feasible
only with bus-sized satellites

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:22.626
that cost hundreds of millions,
if not billions, of dollars.

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:26.063
Buoyed by the perception
of profitability,

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:29.700
space has become an attractive
target for private investment:

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:32.869
almost 17 billion dollars
since 2000,

00:49:32.869 --> 00:49:35.439
and four billion in 2017 alone.

00:49:36.406 --> 00:49:39.743
As a result, some sectors
of space are transitioning

00:49:39.743 --> 00:49:42.846
from a top-down
government-fed operation

00:49:42.846 --> 00:49:44.214
to a globalized industry

00:49:44.214 --> 00:49:46.783
with worldwide supply
chains and customers.

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:51.455
Using both domestic investment
and products and services

00:49:51.455 --> 00:49:53.990
from this rapidly
growing private sector,

00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:56.026
the rest of the world
is leapfrogging

00:49:56.593 --> 00:49:59.162
decades-worth
of technological development

00:49:59.162 --> 00:50:01.164
aiming to build systems
that can compete

00:50:01.164 --> 00:50:02.866
with the United States
in many areas,

00:50:02.866 --> 00:50:05.702
including launch,
robotic space operations,

00:50:05.702 --> 00:50:07.037
and even human exploration.

00:50:07.704 --> 00:50:10.807
My central point is that threats
to U.S. leadership in space

00:50:10.807 --> 00:50:14.678
have arisen primarily from
these structural changes

00:50:14.678 --> 00:50:16.446
that are enabling
many more countries

00:50:16.446 --> 00:50:19.049
to target and achieve
success in space.

00:50:19.049 --> 00:50:20.550
And there is no turning
back the clock.

00:50:21.551 --> 00:50:23.720
In this environment,
maintaining U.S. leadership

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:26.123
means that the United States,
more than ever,

00:50:26.123 --> 00:50:29.393
needs to leverage its core
competitive advantage,

00:50:29.393 --> 00:50:32.129
an innovation ecosystem
that rewards creativity,

00:50:32.129 --> 00:50:34.030
entrepreneurship,
and risk-taking.

00:50:34.798 --> 00:50:36.066
Going beyond the fundamental,

00:50:36.066 --> 00:50:38.034
there are some space
sector specific actions

00:50:38.034 --> 00:50:39.236
that would be relevant as well.

00:50:39.836 --> 00:50:41.271
I propose we begin with three:

00:50:41.772 --> 00:50:44.708
ensure that our regulations
empower the U.S. private sector

00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:47.043
to continue to out-innovate
the rest of the world;

00:50:47.577 --> 00:50:49.980
ensure government spending
is more efficient;

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:52.949
and invest in capabilities
where we absolutely

00:50:52.949 --> 00:50:54.818
must have overwhelming advantage

00:50:54.818 --> 00:50:56.119
over other countries.

00:50:56.119 --> 00:50:58.455
I look forward to contributing
to this discussion.

00:50:58.455 --> 00:51:07.397
(Applause.)

00:51:07.397 --> 00:51:09.065
The Vice President: Well, I 
want to thank all the panelists,

00:51:09.065 --> 00:51:15.338
so I'm going to go to several
of our security members

00:51:15.338 --> 00:51:17.941
of the council
who are with us today,

00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:24.047
but let me, maybe, direct my
first question to Dr. Lal.

00:51:24.047 --> 00:51:30.654
Your -- you have spoken about
the challenges that we face.

00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:33.356
You refer to
structural challenges;

00:51:33.356 --> 00:51:34.458
there's no going back;

00:51:34.458 --> 00:51:37.761
the United States has to
continue to lean in to remain,

00:51:38.962 --> 00:51:41.431
to use your words,
a preeminent leader in space.

00:51:43.133 --> 00:51:47.671
You have written and spoken
about space traffic management.

00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:51.408
Is there a policy decision
you would have this council

00:51:51.408 --> 00:51:53.877
consider related to that,

00:51:54.978 --> 00:51:57.547
and could you expand
on that briefly?

00:51:58.248 --> 00:51:59.850
Ms. Lal: Sure.

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:02.886
So, space traffic management
is a very critical component

00:52:02.886 --> 00:52:05.055
of our private sector
leadership in space,

00:52:05.555 --> 00:52:08.925
primarily because
it gives us the clarity --

00:52:08.925 --> 00:52:11.261
it gives the companies
the clarity they need

00:52:11.261 --> 00:52:13.430
to do unfettered work in space.

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:15.565
It allows us to work
collaboratively

00:52:15.565 --> 00:52:17.334
with other countries,

00:52:17.334 --> 00:52:19.336
especially if we have a fabric

00:52:19.336 --> 00:52:21.838
of the management
system that is --

00:52:21.838 --> 00:52:24.541
that joins with each other,

00:52:25.041 --> 00:52:28.512
and there is agreement
across the world

00:52:28.512 --> 00:52:30.213
as to how we want to go forward

00:52:31.081 --> 00:52:35.452
to make sure that space is safe
and sustainable to operate in.

00:52:36.453 --> 00:52:38.054
The Vice President:
It --

00:52:38.054 --> 00:52:40.023
I've got people
who know a lot more

00:52:40.023 --> 00:52:41.491
about this than me
at this table,

00:52:41.491 --> 00:52:45.729
but it sounds to me like you're
calling on the United States

00:52:45.729 --> 00:52:49.065
to play a wider role in ensuring

00:52:49.065 --> 00:52:52.002
that we have the same kind
of deconfliction agreements

00:52:52.002 --> 00:52:54.604
that we have in areas
of conflict

00:52:55.205 --> 00:53:00.377
that we have in terms of issues
of navigation on the seven seas,

00:53:00.377 --> 00:53:02.646
and that you're suggesting
that the United States

00:53:03.446 --> 00:53:06.449
lean in to that effort
and provide that guidance

00:53:06.449 --> 00:53:07.784
and drive those agreements.
Ms. Lal:

00:53:08.318 --> 00:53:10.186
I absolutely think
the United States

00:53:10.186 --> 00:53:12.022
needs to take
a leadership position here.

00:53:12.022 --> 00:53:13.924
The Vice President:
Yeah.

00:53:13.924 --> 00:53:16.092
Very insightful;
appreciate that very much.

00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:19.796
The Deputy Secretary of Defense
is with us today, Pat Shanahan.

00:53:19.796 --> 00:53:21.464
Mr. Secretary,
would you like to --

00:53:22.566 --> 00:53:25.769
Deputy Secretary Shanahan:
A quick question there for Dean.

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:27.938
Thank you for your remarks
this morning.

00:53:29.439 --> 00:53:34.077
My question is around
civil/military partnerships

00:53:34.077 --> 00:53:36.379
that you've observed in China,

00:53:36.379 --> 00:53:39.215
and maybe it's not
just civil/military

00:53:39.215 --> 00:53:41.284
but industrial/military.

00:53:42.218 --> 00:53:47.123
Have you seen a different
dynamic in the partnerships

00:53:47.824 --> 00:53:50.327
that we should observe,
or take notice of?

00:53:53.296 --> 00:53:56.566
Mr. Cheng: The Chinese 
have published extensively

00:53:56.566 --> 00:53:59.369
on the issues of things
like mobilization,

00:54:00.003 --> 00:54:01.338
where they include things

00:54:01.338 --> 00:54:03.573
like science and technology
mobilization.

00:54:03.573 --> 00:54:06.543
So, there is an explicit
organizational structure,

00:54:07.043 --> 00:54:09.145
regulatory structure, et cetera,

00:54:09.145 --> 00:54:12.916
for the incorporation
of people, equipment,

00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:14.517
as well as facilities.

00:54:14.517 --> 00:54:17.087
So, when we think about
China's space program,

00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:21.257
we should be thinking of it not
simply in terms of the elements

00:54:21.257 --> 00:54:23.393
that are currently
in the military,

00:54:23.393 --> 00:54:24.928
but the reach-back
that the Chinese

00:54:24.928 --> 00:54:26.896
have explicitly talked about,

00:54:26.896 --> 00:54:29.933
in terms of bringing in
everything from universities,

00:54:29.933 --> 00:54:31.801
to corporate assets,

00:54:31.801 --> 00:54:34.304
to industrial personnel
and equipment.

00:54:35.338 --> 00:54:36.439
Deputy Secretary Shanahan:
Thank you.

00:54:39.376 --> 00:54:41.277
The Vice President: We're fortunate to have with us today --

00:54:41.277 --> 00:54:42.812
I know he was
formally introduced,

00:54:42.812 --> 00:54:44.547
but Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff,

00:54:45.615 --> 00:54:47.017
General Joseph Dunford.

00:54:47.017 --> 00:54:49.085
You could welcome him
one more time, if you'd like.

00:54:49.085 --> 00:54:50.387
He is an extraordinary --

00:54:50.387 --> 00:54:53.156
(Applause.)

00:54:53.156 --> 00:54:55.225
The Vice President:
General?

00:54:55.225 --> 00:54:57.527
General Dunford:
I have a question

00:54:57.527 --> 00:54:58.595
for Mr. Manber.

00:54:58.595 --> 00:55:02.832
You talked about not allowing
concerns over technology

00:55:02.832 --> 00:55:05.335
transfer to inhibit
our progress,

00:55:05.335 --> 00:55:08.038
but, you know, it struck me
as I was listening

00:55:08.038 --> 00:55:11.775
to the recap of the strategy
from General McMaster

00:55:11.775 --> 00:55:14.044
that we are going
to have concerns

00:55:14.044 --> 00:55:16.346
over protecting our
intellectual property

00:55:16.346 --> 00:55:17.714
and our classified information.

00:55:18.248 --> 00:55:19.983
And I wonder, from
an industry perspective,

00:55:19.983 --> 00:55:21.885
with now three
decades of experience,

00:55:21.885 --> 00:55:23.486
you can maybe
talk a little bit

00:55:23.486 --> 00:55:25.088
about how do we get
that balance right?

00:55:25.088 --> 00:55:27.290
Because, again, as
we implement the strategy,

00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:29.426
we ought to think
about that up front,

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:32.228
and make sure that we do that.

00:55:32.228 --> 00:55:33.830
And I -- I'm particularly
struck by it

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:36.032
because of the brief on China,

00:55:36.032 --> 00:55:38.835
and although you say that
most of their capabilities

00:55:38.835 --> 00:55:40.103
are indigenous
and homegrown.

00:55:40.904 --> 00:55:43.573
That would actually be unique
in Chinese experience

00:55:43.573 --> 00:55:45.875
that most of their current,
modern capabilities

00:55:45.875 --> 00:55:47.844
are indigenous and homegrown
because I think we know

00:55:47.844 --> 00:55:50.447
that we've had intellectual
property challenge,

00:55:50.447 --> 00:55:52.382
and a classified information
challenge, with China.

00:55:52.382 --> 00:55:53.817
So, maybe, Mr. Manber,

00:55:53.817 --> 00:55:57.220
you're probably the best
one to address that,

00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:58.755
and, again, it's about
getting the balance right.

00:55:58.755 --> 00:56:00.156
Mr. Manber: Right, it's 
a fascinating question

00:56:01.725 --> 00:56:03.326
and thank you for it.

00:56:03.326 --> 00:56:05.295
It's very difficult
in our industry

00:56:06.229 --> 00:56:09.265
to strike the right balance
between competitiveness

00:56:09.265 --> 00:56:10.767
and assuring that, you know,

00:56:10.767 --> 00:56:12.936
America safeguards
its technology.

00:56:13.837 --> 00:56:18.041
But I suppose that
we have already worked

00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:20.343
with NASA very carefully,
and others,

00:56:20.343 --> 00:56:22.746
to ensure that there's
no technology transfer.

00:56:23.513 --> 00:56:26.916
We work very closely
to assure that they learn,

00:56:26.916 --> 00:56:30.086
the Chinese and other
of the nations we work with --

00:56:30.086 --> 00:56:32.122
I said we work
with some 30 nations;

00:56:32.122 --> 00:56:34.958
they've included Viet Nam,
Peru, and others --

00:56:34.958 --> 00:56:36.893
that there is
no technology transfer,

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:39.796
that the guidelines
and practices

00:56:39.796 --> 00:56:41.831
of the International
Space Station

00:56:41.831 --> 00:56:43.166
remain confidential.

00:56:44.367 --> 00:56:47.604
At the same time, we see
that just a few weeks ago,

00:56:47.604 --> 00:56:51.174
there's Canadian satellites
launching with the Chinese,

00:56:51.174 --> 00:56:54.144
there's Danish companies
that are developing satellites

00:56:54.144 --> 00:56:56.246
that are flying
with the Chinese.

00:56:57.981 --> 00:57:01.718
My point is that if we go in
with American leadership,

00:57:01.718 --> 00:57:05.188
and we go in and we can say
to the Chinese,

00:57:05.188 --> 00:57:08.892
"Here is the issues that
we regard as important in IP,

00:57:08.892 --> 00:57:11.027
copyright protection,
technology transfer,"

00:57:11.961 --> 00:57:13.963
there is when we have
the greatest strength,

00:57:13.963 --> 00:57:17.066
starting new, starting
with a new marketplace,

00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:18.902
to ensure that we get
what we need.

00:57:19.836 --> 00:57:22.539
And as the President has said,
we want to, you know, revamp

00:57:22.539 --> 00:57:24.908
and reconsider
our relations with China.

00:57:24.908 --> 00:57:28.411
And so, I can see no better
opportunity than to do it here,

00:57:28.411 --> 00:57:30.113
where we're not involved today,

00:57:30.113 --> 00:57:32.215
but we're clearly leaders
of the free world.

00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:35.351
General Dunford:
Yeah, thank you.

00:57:36.186 --> 00:57:37.453
The Vice President:
Secretary of Homeland Security

00:57:37.453 --> 00:57:39.889
Kirstjen Nielsen is recognized,
thank you, Kirstjen.

00:57:40.423 --> 00:57:41.524
Secretary Nielsen:
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

00:57:41.524 --> 00:57:43.326
Good morning,
and thank you to the panelists.

00:57:44.093 --> 00:57:45.795
My question is just
for all of you.

00:57:46.362 --> 00:57:48.565
As the Secretary of the
Department of Homeland Security,

00:57:48.565 --> 00:57:52.101
we care deeply about
space-based services,

00:57:52.101 --> 00:57:54.971
everything from the weather
and the satellites

00:57:54.971 --> 00:57:57.273
that we get from NOAA
in the Commerce Department,

00:57:57.841 --> 00:58:00.443
through to our ability
to warn our citizens,

00:58:00.443 --> 00:58:01.744
through to cyber security

00:58:01.744 --> 00:58:04.047
and then very specific
space-based services

00:58:04.047 --> 00:58:06.950
such as GPS-enabled position
navigation and timing.

00:58:07.584 --> 00:58:09.352
So, of concern to me
is making sure

00:58:09.352 --> 00:58:11.187
that as we work
with the private sector

00:58:11.187 --> 00:58:13.156
and as the U.S.
government moves forward,

00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:16.693
that we continue to build
in security and resilience

00:58:16.693 --> 00:58:18.361
into all of our tools.

00:58:18.361 --> 00:58:20.496
What more can
the U.S. government do,

00:58:20.496 --> 00:58:22.866
from your perspective,
to incentivize,

00:58:22.866 --> 00:58:24.033
as we go forward,

00:58:24.033 --> 00:58:25.501
that security and resilience

00:58:25.501 --> 00:58:27.136
in all of our
space-based services

00:58:27.136 --> 00:58:28.638
upon which we're
so heavily reliant?

00:58:31.741 --> 00:58:33.309
Ms. Lal:
So, I would say

00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:35.144
it would be helpful
for the government

00:58:35.144 --> 00:58:37.513
to work more with
the private sector,

00:58:37.513 --> 00:58:39.449
especially the part
of the private sector

00:58:39.449 --> 00:58:41.818
that typically hasn't been
in the government fold.

00:58:42.418 --> 00:58:45.088
And one way to do that
would be to make sure

00:58:45.088 --> 00:58:48.157
that the government uses
more commercial approaches,

00:58:48.157 --> 00:58:49.525
you know, things that, you know,

00:58:49.525 --> 00:58:53.296
not necessarily
cost-plus type contracts

00:58:53.296 --> 00:58:57.934
but ones that are more
solutions are outcome-driven

00:58:57.934 --> 00:59:01.304
where there's milestones and
payments based on milestones.

00:59:01.838 --> 00:59:03.606
Another alternative would be,

00:59:03.606 --> 00:59:06.376
another activity
to add would be,

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:09.445
to be able to accept
80 percent solutions,

00:59:10.113 --> 00:59:12.916
because that would just
really improve the aperture

00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:16.352
with the kind of companies
you can work with.

00:59:16.352 --> 00:59:18.221
We don't always need
to have a Ferrari;

00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:19.956
we can sometimes
use a Ford Focus.

00:59:21.925 --> 00:59:23.793
Mr. Manber:
I'll just quickly add that

00:59:23.793 --> 00:59:26.396
from our experience
at NanoRocks,

00:59:26.396 --> 00:59:28.998
we have a very robust
relationship with NASA

00:59:28.998 --> 00:59:30.233
on all levels.

00:59:30.233 --> 00:59:33.503
And having this sort
of partnership is critical.

00:59:34.337 --> 00:59:37.173
We always are
in lockstep with NASA

00:59:37.173 --> 00:59:39.709
on what we're doing,
especially as we go overseas.

00:59:40.376 --> 00:59:42.245
And you have to, you know,
there's emerging

00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:46.582
throughout the U.S. government
great folks who care,

00:59:47.083 --> 00:59:49.452
more than just getting up
and doing their job.

00:59:49.452 --> 00:59:51.921
And this is at DOD,
this is at NASA,

00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:53.289
and they really work with us

00:59:53.289 --> 00:59:56.759
to make sure that we don't
overstep what might be proper.

00:59:56.759 --> 00:59:58.561
We're always itching
to do more, of course;

00:59:58.561 --> 00:59:59.762
it's the commercial sector.

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:02.198
But you have to have
the relationships

01:00:02.198 --> 01:00:04.767
with the government officials
and the government folks.

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:07.170
And so, we really appreciate
our relationship with NASA.

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:08.871
And so, passing this along,

01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:12.342
I would say it's not something
maybe you can codify.

01:00:12.342 --> 01:00:14.410
You just have to have
an organize relationship

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:16.946
to be smarter,
to be alert,

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:18.548
and don't consider
the government,

01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:20.083
always, as the enemy,

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:22.585
but work with them on these
sort of critical issues.

01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:26.456
Mr. Cheng:
Ma'am, I would say that one

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:27.991
of the things to keep in mind

01:00:27.991 --> 01:00:32.395
is that space is part of
a larger information ecosystem.

01:00:33.062 --> 01:00:35.598
The Chinese view space
very holistically.

01:00:35.598 --> 01:00:37.700
When they talk about space
and space dominance,

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.736
they are talking not
only about satellites,

01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:40.770
but ground stations,

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:42.672
and the data links
that tie them all together,

01:00:42.672 --> 01:00:44.941
as well as the information
that passes over it.

01:00:44.941 --> 01:00:46.376
When we think about resilience,

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:49.412
then, we need to be
thinking beyond just space.

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:51.114
We need to be thinking
about redundancies,

01:00:51.114 --> 01:00:53.116
whether it's things
like EE Loran,

01:00:53.116 --> 01:00:55.718
or other alternatives
that may not be orbital.

01:00:55.718 --> 01:00:57.453
And when we think
about protecting

01:00:57.453 --> 01:00:59.088
our space capabilities,

01:00:59.088 --> 01:01:01.257
it means, again,
thinking holistically

01:01:01.257 --> 01:01:03.793
because it's really about
the information that passes

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:05.695
over and through
those space systems.

01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:11.067
The Vice President:
Join me in thanking these

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:12.101
outstanding panelists

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:15.138
for their inights and 
participation in the program.

01:01:15.138 --> 01:01:16.572
(Applause.)

01:01:16.572 --> 01:01:17.907
Thank you, all,
great job, great job.

01:01:17.907 --> 01:01:21.978
(Applause.)

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:27.150
The next panel is
entitled entrepreneurship

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:28.351
on the next frontier.

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:30.787
I'll invite our
panelists to go ahead

01:01:30.787 --> 01:01:33.589
and make your way
to the stage.

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:35.892
And before we get started,

01:01:35.892 --> 01:01:40.096
let me just say
to all the members

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:42.765
of the National Space Council.

01:01:42.765 --> 01:01:45.668
I think we've heard some very
insightful recommendations.

01:01:45.668 --> 01:01:50.073
And particularly, would request
General McMaster that --

01:01:51.407 --> 01:01:56.312
if you could develop a plan
that identifies additional steps

01:01:56.312 --> 01:01:59.415
derived from
the discussion today

01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:01.717
that ought to be added
to our space strategy.

01:02:01.717 --> 01:02:05.054
We'll look forward
to your presentation

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:09.225
on that at the next
National Space Council meeting.

01:02:12.795 --> 01:02:15.264
They've written me very
thoughtful opening remarks

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:17.467
about entrepreneurship
and the next frontier.

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:23.606
But in the interest of time,
let me be brief and say,

01:02:23.606 --> 01:02:28.578
President Trump
is for it, all right?

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:30.480
I was on the phone with
the President yesterday,

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.882
and this businessman turned
President of the United States

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:35.184
has great pride
and great enthusiasm

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:39.155
in not only the partnership,
the historic partnership

01:02:39.856 --> 01:02:43.626
between private sector
organizations and NASA,

01:02:44.127 --> 01:02:47.196
but also great pride
in the development

01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:48.898
of new platforms
and innovation

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:53.236
that we saw just two weeks
ahead with the Falcon Heavy,

01:02:53.236 --> 01:02:57.106
and that we see in all the names
of all the different rockets

01:02:57.106 --> 01:02:59.675
that we talked about
in my presentation today.

01:02:59.675 --> 01:03:04.080
I was at the Mojave Desert,
and visited the --

01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:06.816
another American space port.

01:03:06.816 --> 01:03:10.153
And I can't help but think,
100 years from now,

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:15.358
it will be our private
sector pioneers

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:18.561
that helped lift America

01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:22.165
into this new era
of space exploration,

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:24.634
just as American pioneers
have done in the past.

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:27.069
So, that said, I just
want to express

01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:28.738
a great enthusiasm
in President Trump,

01:03:28.738 --> 01:03:30.907
the great gratitude
to this distinguished panel,

01:03:32.241 --> 01:03:33.543
and let me introduce them all,

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:35.111
and then invite you
to give them a welcome.

01:03:35.778 --> 01:03:36.646
In the interest of time,

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:39.515
I'll ask the panelists
to summarize your remarks.

01:03:39.515 --> 01:03:41.250
We'll have time
for a few questions

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:43.886
before we're spirited
off to a tour,

01:03:43.886 --> 01:03:45.488
and I have to wing my way,

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:46.822
with many of these
Cabinet officials,

01:03:46.822 --> 01:03:48.824
back to Washington, D.C.

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:52.128
Our first panelist
is Mr. Eric Stallmer,

01:03:52.128 --> 01:03:54.397
president of Commercial
Spaceflight Federation,

01:03:55.097 --> 01:03:59.202
one of our hosts here today
for events last evening.

01:03:59.869 --> 01:04:01.404
Secondly is Kevin O'Connell,

01:04:01.404 --> 01:04:03.306
president of Innovative
Analytics Training.

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.408
Then, there's Tom Stroup,

01:04:05.408 --> 01:04:07.443
president of Satellite
Industry Association.

01:04:07.443 --> 01:04:08.377
And our fourth panelist

01:04:08.377 --> 01:04:10.947
is Dr. Mary Lynne Dittmar,

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:15.017
president and CEO of the 
Coalition for Deep Space Exploration.

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:17.553
These are the four
great champions

01:04:17.553 --> 01:04:19.322
of American
entrepreneurship in space,

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:20.590
and we're honored
to have you all here.

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:22.592
Thank you so very much.

01:04:22.592 --> 01:04:26.862
(Applause.)

01:04:26.862 --> 01:04:28.564
Mr. Stallmer, if you
could get it started,

01:04:28.564 --> 01:04:30.366
and briefly summarize
your remarks,

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:31.634
we'll move through
the panel quickly.

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:33.102
Thank you.

01:04:33.102 --> 01:04:34.303
Mr. Stallmer:
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:37.707
Cabinet secretaries and members
of the National Space Council,

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:39.308
thank you so much
for giving me the opportunity

01:04:39.308 --> 01:04:41.077
to be here today.

01:04:41.077 --> 01:04:42.612
America's commercial
space sector

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:44.180
is growing at a pace
and breadth,

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.616
creating thousands
of high-tech jobs

01:04:46.616 --> 01:04:49.285
driven by billions of dollars
of private sector investment.

01:04:50.052 --> 01:04:52.955
Last year, we witnessed
many breakthrough capabilities

01:04:52.955 --> 01:04:54.724
by U.S. commercial
space companies.

01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:57.293
And just recently,
as we discussed today,

01:04:57.293 --> 01:04:58.961
just last week --
or a few weeks ago,

01:04:58.961 --> 01:05:01.330
SpaceX launched
its Falcon Heavy,

01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:03.366
the first heavy
lift rocket developed

01:05:03.366 --> 01:05:05.067
and launched with
fully private funding.

01:05:05.668 --> 01:05:08.070
And Blue Origin flew
its new Shepard to space

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:12.008
under the new RLV license,
the first such revenue flight.

01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:14.510
They're also developing
their own heavy lift vehicle

01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:16.412
with private sector funding --
with private funding.

01:05:17.713 --> 01:05:20.516
But two significant challenges
threaten America's goals

01:05:20.516 --> 01:05:22.818
in expanding
our economic sphere and --

01:05:22.818 --> 01:05:27.723
deepening into space:
commercial space transportation

01:05:27.723 --> 01:05:30.393
and remote sensing are growing
at unprecedented rated,

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:34.463
while new space applications,
like space manufacturing,

01:05:34.463 --> 01:05:37.133
resource prospecting,
and human habitation,

01:05:37.133 --> 01:05:38.901
are being introduced.

01:05:38.901 --> 01:05:41.871
As discussed earlier,
our legal and regulatory

01:05:41.871 --> 01:05:44.473
and organizational frameworks
have not caught up

01:05:44.473 --> 01:05:47.310
and are putting on the brakes
on our current progress,

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:49.078
as well as our
future possibilities.

01:05:50.446 --> 01:05:52.181
We need to strive
for what economists

01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:55.318
call permission-less
innovation in spaceflight.

01:05:56.018 --> 01:05:59.021
So long as public safety,
international obligations,

01:05:59.021 --> 01:06:01.390
and national security
are not compromised,

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:04.126
the presumption should be
that a commercial space project

01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:05.661
can proceed.

01:06:05.661 --> 01:06:07.096
The regulation of space launch

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:08.831
and re-entry
to protect the public

01:06:08.831 --> 01:06:10.633
definitely warrant
a licensed regime;

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:13.102
however, the current
regulations,

01:06:13.102 --> 01:06:14.403
written decades ago,

01:06:14.403 --> 01:06:17.473
based on 1980s technologies
and operations,

01:06:18.074 --> 01:06:20.476
those rockets were expendable,
very expensive,

01:06:20.976 --> 01:06:23.746
and infrequently launched,
and carried only one payloads.

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:28.517
Space ports also faced
inconsistent interpretations

01:06:28.517 --> 01:06:30.119
of regulations
and requirements.

01:06:30.753 --> 01:06:33.155
The same rules that are
required to be implement --

01:06:33.155 --> 01:06:34.924
the same rules are required
to be implemented

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:36.926
differently at different
launch sites.

01:06:37.693 --> 01:06:41.263
And even modest improvements
to space ports infrastructure

01:06:41.263 --> 01:06:43.766
can require new rounds
of environmental review

01:06:43.766 --> 01:06:47.103
because it modifies the launch
site operator's license.

01:06:48.137 --> 01:06:50.806
Our members at CSF at eager
to work with the administration

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:53.843
to modernize and streamline
various licensing rules

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:57.813
into one performance-based rule
that preserves public safety

01:06:57.813 --> 01:07:00.783
without restricting industry
speed and flexibility

01:07:00.783 --> 01:07:03.986
to invent a future where
launchers are more frequent,

01:07:03.986 --> 01:07:06.088
more affordable,
and certainly, more reliable.

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:10.426
In many cases, rules can be made
clearer and more concise,

01:07:10.426 --> 01:07:12.695
with explanatory details
left to guidance.

01:07:13.996 --> 01:07:15.364
Remote sensing, in particular,

01:07:15.364 --> 01:07:18.067
has been constrained
by outdated regulations

01:07:18.067 --> 01:07:19.935
that often aren't
faithfully implemented.

01:07:21.036 --> 01:07:22.838
And finally, it's time for
the federal government

01:07:22.838 --> 01:07:24.840
to create a minimalistic process

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:27.777
for improving new
commercial space activities

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:29.745
by U.S. companies.

01:07:29.745 --> 01:07:32.381
H.R. 2809 provides
narrowly tailored

01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:35.050
approach to government
oversight of those activities,

01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:37.253
which why CSF has
endorsed this passage.

01:07:38.287 --> 01:07:39.855
With commercial
space industry --

01:07:40.456 --> 01:07:42.425
with a commercial space
industry unleashed

01:07:42.425 --> 01:07:44.059
to advance quickly
as possible,

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.629
the U.S. government
needs to adapt

01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:48.330
to gain the maximum
public benefit.

01:07:48.864 --> 01:07:50.699
Commercial companies
can deliver results

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:53.035
faster and cheaper
for taxpayers,

01:07:53.035 --> 01:07:55.671
but only a federal agency
can use commercial friendly

01:07:55.671 --> 01:07:58.207
procurement methods
that pay for results,

01:07:58.207 --> 01:07:59.975
not for it -- just effort.

01:07:59.975 --> 01:08:01.610
For example, NASA
should be encouraged

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:03.045
to use competitively-awarded,

01:08:03.045 --> 01:08:05.548
cost-shared funded
Space Act agreements

01:08:05.548 --> 01:08:08.417
to develop new space
exploration capabilities

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:11.053
so that the United States
can affordably accelerate

01:08:11.053 --> 01:08:12.254
a return to the moon,

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:14.223
and voyages beyond.

01:08:14.223 --> 01:08:17.126
All space-related agencies
should ask the question:

01:08:17.126 --> 01:08:18.194
can we partner?

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:21.030
Before taking the traditional
cost plus contracting path.

01:08:22.164 --> 01:08:26.268
In conclusion, America's
industrial paradigm for space

01:08:26.268 --> 01:08:29.138
has fundamentally changed,
developing to a point

01:08:29.138 --> 01:08:30.606
where the U.S.
government regulations

01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:33.676
and contracting practices
are now our largest impediments.

01:08:34.343 --> 01:08:37.313
Now, more than ever, we need
the National Space Council,

01:08:37.313 --> 01:08:39.982
and we need you to take action
and work with industry.

01:08:39.982 --> 01:08:41.984
Thank you so much
for your time.

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:51.627
(Applause.)

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:52.761
The Vice President: Thank you
very much, Mr. Stallmer.

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:54.530
Mr. O'Connell,
you're recognized.

01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:55.764
Mr. O'Connell:
Mr. Vice President,

01:08:55.764 --> 01:09:01.136
distinguished Cabinet members,
invited guests, good morning.

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:02.872
My name is Kevin O'Connell.

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:05.708
I am the founder and CEO
of Innovative Analytics

01:09:05.708 --> 01:09:06.809
and Training,

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:08.911
a small private consulting
firm in Washington, D.C.

01:09:09.678 --> 01:09:11.447
Today, I'm going to
bring forward to you

01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:13.716
my 25 years of writing

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:16.352
and analyzing commercial
remote sensing

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:18.287
for both government
and commercial clients.

01:09:19.088 --> 01:09:20.389
I'd like to talk to you
this morning

01:09:20.389 --> 01:09:22.458
about entrepreneurship
on the next frontier,

01:09:22.458 --> 01:09:23.792
but if you'll allow me,

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.294
I'd like to spend
a couple of minutes

01:09:25.294 --> 01:09:28.697
showcasing the commercial
remote sensing example

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:31.700
first from a perspective
of its promise, but secondly,

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:33.502
from the continuing
challenges that we have.

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:34.803
And some of them have
been mentioned already,

01:09:34.803 --> 01:09:36.305
and I'll go quickly over those.

01:09:38.507 --> 01:09:41.277
If you can imagine a traditional
intelligence analyst,

01:09:41.277 --> 01:09:42.878
or a scientist poring over

01:09:42.878 --> 01:09:45.614
a small number
of satellite images,

01:09:45.614 --> 01:09:47.516
you have a somewhat
outdated view of the world.

01:09:48.183 --> 01:09:50.085
American firms are at
the cutting edge

01:09:50.085 --> 01:09:52.555
of the global commercial
remote sensing market.

01:09:53.489 --> 01:09:55.724
They collect images
with high resolution,

01:09:55.724 --> 01:09:57.226
with increasing frequency,

01:09:57.793 --> 01:10:00.629
and create unprecedented
volumes of information.

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:03.499
Other innovators
are harnessing machine

01:10:03.499 --> 01:10:06.368
learning and other advanced
analytic techniques

01:10:06.368 --> 01:10:09.338
to gain insight
into that industry imagery.

01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:12.975
And yet other potential
entrants to the market

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:15.477
want to collect even more
exquisite satellite data,

01:10:16.178 --> 01:10:18.747
with other capabilities
like radio frequency data

01:10:18.747 --> 01:10:20.149
and social media.

01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:21.617
These American firms have access

01:10:21.617 --> 01:10:23.619
to world-class
satellite technology,

01:10:23.619 --> 01:10:25.254
and they're leveraging
breakthroughs

01:10:25.254 --> 01:10:27.523
and cloud computing
communications,

01:10:27.523 --> 01:10:29.592
artificial intelligence,
and visualization.

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:34.096
Some analysts believe that
remote sensing-based insights

01:10:34.096 --> 01:10:37.032
will become as important
to commercial decision-making

01:10:37.566 --> 01:10:39.668
as accounting
and computing is today.

01:10:40.502 --> 01:10:43.372
In other words,
we cannot talk about space

01:10:43.372 --> 01:10:45.741
without talking
about the effects

01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:47.943
they're already
on the ground today.

01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:51.814
Other capabilities,
like 3D image processing

01:10:51.814 --> 01:10:54.850
and augmented reality create
breathtaking visualizations

01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:56.885
based on real-time data

01:10:56.885 --> 01:10:59.421
that create new levels
of interaction and exploration.

01:11:00.255 --> 01:11:02.825
As we move deeper
into the insights economy,

01:11:02.825 --> 01:11:04.994
commercial remote sensing
will play an extraordinary role

01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:07.129
in providing
detailed information

01:11:07.129 --> 01:11:09.064
about a wide range
of topics on the ground.

01:11:10.132 --> 01:11:11.734
We all know the old phrase,

01:11:11.734 --> 01:11:14.303
 A picture is worth
a thousand words. 

01:11:14.303 --> 01:11:17.206
Consider, then,
what a million pictures,

01:11:17.206 --> 01:11:20.242
richly detailed,
efficiently organized,

01:11:20.242 --> 01:11:23.012
time sequenced,
and thoroughly analyzed

01:11:23.012 --> 01:11:26.115
might mean for what
we understand about today,

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:27.383
and even tomorrow.

01:11:28.217 --> 01:11:30.753
For the U.S. commercial
remote sensing industry,

01:11:30.753 --> 01:11:33.489
that's just one big step
on the way to the next frontier.

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:37.793
Next year marks,
as has been said,

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:40.462
the 25th anniversary of
the modern regulatory system

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:41.697
for commercial remote sensing.

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:44.266
While there has been
great progress,

01:11:44.266 --> 01:11:47.336
the process still hinders
the speed of U.S. innovation.

01:11:48.037 --> 01:11:50.039
First of all,
technological developments

01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:52.274
are outstripping our ability
to think about policy

01:11:52.274 --> 01:11:53.642
and regulatory developments.

01:11:54.243 --> 01:11:56.445
Much of the current
regulatory regime and outdated,

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:58.714
reflecting, technology
and business processes

01:11:58.714 --> 01:12:00.449
from the early 2000s.

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:02.751
Secondly, remote sensing impacts

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:05.354
a very wide range of
U.S. government interests,

01:12:05.354 --> 01:12:07.556
from national security
and foreign policy,

01:12:07.556 --> 01:12:09.124
to agriculture and weather.

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:12.194
Too many stakeholders delay
the licensing process,

01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:14.730
and as a result, sometimes
restricting companies

01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:18.033
from providing more advanced
remote sensing capabilities

01:12:18.033 --> 01:12:19.768
and the continuous
flow of data

01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:23.072
expected in today's
high-speed global markets

01:12:23.072 --> 01:12:26.942
in areas like agriculture,
finance, insurance, and others.

01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:29.578
Third, because satellite imagery

01:12:29.578 --> 01:12:32.481
is crucial to our nation's
defense and intelligence,

01:12:32.481 --> 01:12:34.183
it creates a level of caution

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:36.719
that can slow or restrict
innovations to market.

01:12:37.319 --> 01:12:40.522
We know that commercialization
creates challenges

01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:42.424
for U.S. national security,

01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:46.462
but slowing down or delaying
commercial innovation

01:12:46.462 --> 01:12:48.530
is neither consistent
with U.S. policy,

01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:50.866
nor likely to be
a successful strategy.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:55.671
Commercial innovators face a
new kind of innovator's dilemma:

01:12:55.671 --> 01:12:57.773
those with the most
innovative ideas

01:12:57.773 --> 01:12:59.475
wait the longest time
for approval.

01:13:00.075 --> 01:13:02.678
As innovators languish
in the regulatory process,

01:13:02.678 --> 01:13:04.880
foreign competitors
can jump out

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.949
and take advantage
of the original precedent.

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:09.685
But now, many of the remedies
are well-known,

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:11.053
and have been
discussed here today.

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:12.621
The need to shorten
and hold accountable

01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:14.623
U.S. licensing time lines,

01:13:14.623 --> 01:13:16.125
the need to create
the presumption of yes

01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:18.694
in the licensing process,
and getting the elevation

01:13:18.694 --> 01:13:20.763
to the Cabinet level
of hard decisions.

01:13:21.764 --> 01:13:23.465
Regulation space-based
capabilities

01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:26.869
must also take into account
the other technologies

01:13:26.869 --> 01:13:28.103
that are coming forward
in the market,

01:13:28.103 --> 01:13:30.739
such as drones and
high-altitude air vehicles.

01:13:32.608 --> 01:13:34.877
In essence, remote sensing
is moving rapidly

01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:37.513
from a traditional
aerospace capability,

01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:40.382
affecting a small number
of important decisions

01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:42.518
to an information capability

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:44.286
affecting thousands
of decisions,

01:13:44.286 --> 01:13:45.754
every single day.

01:13:45.754 --> 01:13:47.689
Even as we improve
the environment

01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:49.124
for U.S. commercial firms,

01:13:49.124 --> 01:13:52.461
a new slate of issues,
such as intellectual property,

01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:53.862
geospatial privacy,

01:13:54.396 --> 01:13:55.964
and foreign trade barriers

01:13:55.964 --> 01:13:58.167
will have to be incorporated
into our way of thinking.

01:13:59.635 --> 01:14:02.471
The 25-year case study
of commercial remote

01:14:02.471 --> 01:14:04.807
sensing provides important
lessons for how to think

01:14:04.807 --> 01:14:07.743
about the nation's broader
space commerce pursuits.

01:14:08.811 --> 01:14:10.512
We need to do a better job,
for example,

01:14:10.512 --> 01:14:13.482
of learning lessons
across the board areas

01:14:13.482 --> 01:14:15.884
like data rights, licensing,
and data protection.

01:14:16.451 --> 01:14:19.555
We also need to do a better job
of anticipating capabilities

01:14:19.555 --> 01:14:21.323
that are coming forward
in the market.

01:14:21.323 --> 01:14:23.158
This will allow for
early consideration

01:14:23.158 --> 01:14:26.195
of possible U.S. government
use and public policy impact.

01:14:26.728 --> 01:14:29.164
We've done well, for example,
in areas like non-Earth

01:14:29.164 --> 01:14:31.767
imaging and spatial
situational awareness.

01:14:32.434 --> 01:14:35.504
Finally, we need to encourage
strong, continuing collaboration

01:14:35.504 --> 01:14:37.639
between the U.S.
government and industry.

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:40.509
We need to do a better job of
harnessing industry information

01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:42.177
on issues like
global competition,

01:14:42.711 --> 01:14:44.546
international
regulatory activities,

01:14:44.546 --> 01:14:46.114
and emerging sources
of innovation.

01:14:46.615 --> 01:14:49.918
The U.S. government cannot be
the only source of good ideas

01:14:49.918 --> 01:14:52.087
on how to regulate
on complex issues,

01:14:52.087 --> 01:14:54.456
like space debris,
or space traffic management.

01:14:55.591 --> 01:14:59.361
To close, U.S. government
and industry roles are changing

01:14:59.361 --> 01:15:02.331
so we do need to think
about new strategies

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.633
to advance policy
and regulatory mechanisms

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:06.735
to stay as close
to technology as possible.

01:15:07.436 --> 01:15:09.338
We recognize that
U.S. leadership

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:12.241
is as much about shaping
the global environment,

01:15:12.241 --> 01:15:16.044
setting standards, encouraging
international partnerships,

01:15:16.044 --> 01:15:18.347
as it is about being
first in space,

01:15:18.347 --> 01:15:20.449
and in how we
ultimately use the data

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:23.085
in thousands of applications
on the ground every day.

01:15:23.819 --> 01:15:26.288
As in so many other technology
innovation areas,

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:31.393
both past and present, ours must
be a game of moving forward,

01:15:31.393 --> 01:15:32.961
not playing defense.

01:15:32.961 --> 01:15:34.663
Thank you, and I look
forward to your questions.

01:15:35.397 --> 01:15:36.732
The Vice President:
Great.

01:15:36.732 --> 01:15:38.667
Thank you, Kevin,
very well done.

01:15:38.667 --> 01:15:41.837
(Applause.)

01:15:41.837 --> 01:15:44.573
Tom Stroup, Satellite
Industry Association.

01:15:44.573 --> 01:15:46.141
Thank you for being with us.

01:15:46.141 --> 01:15:46.942
Mr. Stroup:
Mr. Vice President,

01:15:46.942 --> 01:15:48.644
the distinguished
members of the council,

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:51.079
I'm honored to be here today
in this extraordinary venue.

01:15:51.813 --> 01:15:54.516
I'm Tom Stroup, president of the
Satellite Industry Association.

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:57.719
SIA is a U.S.
based trade association

01:15:57.719 --> 01:16:00.222
representing the leading
satellite operators,

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:03.926
manufacturers, launch providers,
and ground equipment suppliers.

01:16:04.426 --> 01:16:06.929
We serve commercial, civil,
and military markets.

01:16:07.629 --> 01:16:09.131
I would like to take
this opportunity

01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:11.233
to focus on three areas:

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:13.635
innovation, spectrum certainty,

01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:15.604
and sustainable
space operations.

01:16:16.371 --> 01:16:21.243
Today, the satellite industry
supports over 211,000 U.S. jobs,

01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:22.878
including tens of thousands

01:16:22.878 --> 01:16:25.213
of well-paying
manufacturing positions.

01:16:25.881 --> 01:16:29.651
The satellite industry's
2017 estimated revenue

01:16:29.651 --> 01:16:31.820
was $260.5 billion,

01:16:32.788 --> 01:16:35.691
which does not reflect revenues
from the many businesses

01:16:35.691 --> 01:16:37.359
made possible
by our services.

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.928
Satellites are
constantly operating

01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:41.330
in the background of space,

01:16:41.964 --> 01:16:43.799
enabling the American economy

01:16:43.799 --> 01:16:45.867
in ways consumers
might not be aware.

01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:48.503
Beyond strictly
financial metrics,

01:16:48.503 --> 01:16:51.573
however, our very way of life
depends on the benefits

01:16:51.573 --> 01:16:55.210
we receive from satellite-based
services and applications.

01:16:55.944 --> 01:16:59.648
Satellites, communications,
Earth observation,

01:16:59.648 --> 01:17:03.051
and position navigation
and timing have transformed

01:17:03.051 --> 01:17:04.653
how we communicate,

01:17:04.653 --> 01:17:06.989
how we map, navigate the world,
and see our world.

01:17:07.656 --> 01:17:10.425
How we produce food and energy,
conduct banking,

01:17:10.425 --> 01:17:11.593
predict the weather,

01:17:11.593 --> 01:17:14.129
ensure national security,
and so much more.

01:17:14.129 --> 01:17:16.732
The ubiquity of
satellite coverage

01:17:16.732 --> 01:17:19.267
provides access to areas
across the globe

01:17:19.267 --> 01:17:20.802
that are otherwise unreachable.

01:17:21.603 --> 01:17:24.306
Satellites provide
telecommunication services

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:27.242
to U.S. citizens
from those in rural regions

01:17:27.242 --> 01:17:29.511
without terrestrial
internet access

01:17:29.511 --> 01:17:31.546
to scientists at the South Pole,

01:17:31.546 --> 01:17:34.750
and have proven critical in
areas of natural disasters,

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:36.618
such as the
hurricane-stricken areas,

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:39.121
such as Puerto Rico and Virgin
-- and the Virgin Islands.

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:43.759
Satellite imagery is also
critical for disaster response,

01:17:43.759 --> 01:17:45.961
allowing for
the surveying of damage,

01:17:45.961 --> 01:17:48.330
not just by emergency
management officials,

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:50.465
but by average citizens
from across the globe.

01:17:51.533 --> 01:17:53.068
All of the breakthroughs
we've seen

01:17:53.068 --> 01:17:54.803
because of satellite technology

01:17:54.803 --> 01:17:56.204
should not be taken for granted.

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:58.473
They depend upon our ability,

01:17:58.473 --> 01:18:00.809
our industry's ability
to access spectrum.

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:02.978
In order to sustain

01:18:02.978 --> 01:18:04.212
and meet the growing demand

01:18:04.212 --> 01:18:05.914
for satellite services,

01:18:05.914 --> 01:18:08.417
we encourage regulators
to continue to allocate

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:10.452
sufficient spectrum
for satellite use,

01:18:10.986 --> 01:18:13.488
both domestically
and via U.S. support

01:18:13.488 --> 01:18:16.992
at the upcoming world radio
communications conference.

01:18:17.893 --> 01:18:19.194
Regulatory streaming --

01:18:19.194 --> 01:18:21.830
streamlining uncertainty
also are critical

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:24.566
for the advancement of new
technologies in the industry.

01:18:25.267 --> 01:18:28.437
With plans to launch satellite
constellations of hundreds,

01:18:28.437 --> 01:18:31.606
if not thousands of satellites
over the next decade,

01:18:31.606 --> 01:18:35.844
it is crucial that regulation be
adaptable to new technologies.

01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:39.347
Finally, sustainable
development also --

01:18:39.347 --> 01:18:41.450
must also be at the heart
of innovations

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:43.485
and advancements
of the satellite industry.

01:18:44.086 --> 01:18:46.054
As a shared natural resource,

01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:49.224
it is our responsibility
to protect space

01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:52.461
and ensure its availability
for use by future generations.

01:18:52.961 --> 01:18:54.596
Thank you, and I look
forward to your questions.

01:18:55.831 --> 01:18:56.731
The Vice President:
Thank you very much.

01:18:56.731 --> 01:18:58.667
(Applause.)

01:18:58.667 --> 01:19:01.236
Well done, Tom, appreciate it.

01:19:02.237 --> 01:19:04.439
Mary Lynne Dittmar
is with the Coalition

01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:07.008
for Deep Space Exploration,

01:19:07.008 --> 01:19:09.177
and we're grateful for you here.

01:19:10.112 --> 01:19:11.780
Dr. Dittmar:
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:13.281
Members of the National
Space Council,

01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:14.749
Executive Secretary Pace,

01:19:14.749 --> 01:19:17.285
thank you for inviting me
to speak on entrepreneurship

01:19:17.285 --> 01:19:18.553
and economic expansion

01:19:18.553 --> 01:19:20.255
of the new frontier.

01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:22.424
Entrepreneurial risk-taking
and innovation are,

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:25.727
without doubt, engines for
economic development in space,

01:19:26.361 --> 01:19:28.763
beginning in low Earth orbit,
and expanding toward the moon.

01:19:29.564 --> 01:19:31.466
At the same time,
government programs,

01:19:31.466 --> 01:19:34.102
such as the Space Launch System,
the crew vehicle Orion,

01:19:34.636 --> 01:19:37.339
and the ground systems necessary
to support both government

01:19:37.339 --> 01:19:40.075
and industry provide
much-needed infrastructure

01:19:40.075 --> 01:19:41.443
for further
economic development.

01:19:42.244 --> 01:19:43.712
Even more importantly,

01:19:43.712 --> 01:19:45.747
they maintain national
constancy of purpose

01:19:45.747 --> 01:19:48.650
as a signal to other governments
of the U.S. commitment

01:19:48.650 --> 01:19:50.719
to leadership in space.

01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:52.254
As has already been discussed,

01:19:52.254 --> 01:19:54.623
the nature of the policy
and regulatory framework

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:57.759
guiding our collective issue --
collective efforts is crucial.

01:19:58.493 --> 01:20:01.263
I would like to address the
third trail acquisition reform.

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:05.433
The fiscal programmatic
reporting and management burdens

01:20:05.433 --> 01:20:07.736
associated with
the often-glacial pace

01:20:07.736 --> 01:20:10.739
of traditional contracting
can hardly be overstated.

01:20:10.739 --> 01:20:12.340
As an aside when
I was asked by a member

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:14.009
of the presidential
transition team

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:17.012
what single thing could most
advance exploration of space,

01:20:17.012 --> 01:20:18.513
my answer was far 2.0.

01:20:20.182 --> 01:20:24.019
Of more importance, even alarm
at the slow nature of government

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:27.155
procurements creates barriers
to technological advancement,

01:20:27.155 --> 01:20:29.391
posing a threat to
our national security

01:20:29.391 --> 01:20:30.625
and our leadership in space.

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:33.562
This is not to say
that traditional contracting

01:20:33.562 --> 01:20:35.063
should be abandoned.

01:20:35.063 --> 01:20:36.831
For example, cost-plus contacts

01:20:36.831 --> 01:20:38.934
for managing large-scale
development programs

01:20:38.934 --> 01:20:41.069
provide stability,
reduce industry risk,

01:20:41.069 --> 01:20:43.972
and ensure sustainment
of the U.S. industrial base

01:20:43.972 --> 01:20:46.174
over the years or decades
that are often required

01:20:46.174 --> 01:20:47.742
for these programs.

01:20:47.742 --> 01:20:50.412
That said, the means to leave
the starting gate

01:20:50.412 --> 01:20:53.181
with far more agility
than currently exists,

01:20:53.181 --> 01:20:55.917
as well as renewed mechanisms
for accountability

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:57.185
and constraints on schedule

01:20:57.185 --> 01:21:00.121
and cost growth are of
primary interest and reform.

01:21:01.456 --> 01:21:03.525
Other Transactional
Agreements, or OTAs,

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:04.793
represent a different approach

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:06.194
not subject to the oversight

01:21:06.194 --> 01:21:07.462
required of federal contracts.

01:21:08.096 --> 01:21:10.665
OTAs provide flexibility,
but also increased

01:21:10.665 --> 01:21:13.068
risk of reduced accountability
and transparency.

01:21:13.902 --> 01:21:15.804
For this reason,
the vast majority of them

01:21:15.804 --> 01:21:17.205
are relatively low value.

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:19.040
Notable exceptions include

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.875
the Commercial Orbital
Transportation System,

01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:23.712
or COTS, and the Commercial Crew
Development Program,

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:25.947
both at NASA.
During COTS,

01:21:25.947 --> 01:21:28.316
the government invested a
substantial amount of the cost,

01:21:28.316 --> 01:21:30.852
and left development in the
hands of private enterprise.

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:33.054
The resulting systems
were developed

01:21:33.054 --> 01:21:34.689
at much less cost
to the government

01:21:34.689 --> 01:21:36.958
than a traditional cost-plus
contract would have achieved.

01:21:37.692 --> 01:21:40.362
The story is less clear
with crude systems, however,

01:21:40.362 --> 01:21:42.931
wherein the balance between
contractor discretion,

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:43.965
government insight,

01:21:43.965 --> 01:21:46.167
and the risk to human lives
continues to be debated.

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:49.137
I turn next to public-private
partnerships,

01:21:49.137 --> 01:21:53.675
or P3s, which have advanced
both the A and the S in NASA --

01:21:53.675 --> 01:21:55.443
Aeronautics and Space.

01:21:55.443 --> 01:21:58.847
P3s take many forms: subsidies,
government-backed loans,

01:21:58.847 --> 01:22:01.449
government-owned contractor
operated entities,

01:22:01.449 --> 01:22:03.785
repurposing of public assets,
just to name a few.

01:22:04.519 --> 01:22:08.189
The success of P3s hinges
on informed allocation of risk

01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:10.058
to each side of the partnership.

01:22:10.992 --> 01:22:12.794
A realistic business case,

01:22:12.794 --> 01:22:14.696
which is an indispensable
requirement,

01:22:15.563 --> 01:22:17.699
and a means
to incentivize business

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:20.568
to align private objectives
with the public interest.

01:22:21.436 --> 01:22:24.606
As a path forward into deep
space, P3s carry much promise.

01:22:25.206 --> 01:22:27.709
But as on Earth, they require
a carefully thought out set

01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:30.712
of requirements,
processes, and objectives.

01:22:31.946 --> 01:22:35.583
Each of these models attempts
to balance risk discretion,

01:22:35.583 --> 01:22:39.120
cost incentives, and mission
objectives in different ways.

01:22:40.088 --> 01:22:41.823
I cannot say
this strongly enough:

01:22:42.457 --> 01:22:44.726
decisions regarding
which approach is best

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:46.061
for a given objective

01:22:46.061 --> 01:22:48.396
cannot be driven by ideology,

01:22:48.396 --> 01:22:50.332
whether political
or philosophical.

01:22:51.199 --> 01:22:53.201
Rather, an acquisition framework

01:22:53.201 --> 01:22:55.804
that drives successful program
development and execution

01:22:56.338 --> 01:22:59.741
encourages private investment
and market-driven solutions,

01:22:59.741 --> 01:23:01.343
and maintains
the ability to adapt

01:23:01.343 --> 01:23:03.712
to always-changing
external realities

01:23:03.712 --> 01:23:05.513
should be our
collective goal.

01:23:05.513 --> 01:23:07.515
Thank you.

01:23:07.515 --> 01:23:13.722
(Applause.)

01:23:13.722 --> 01:23:14.556
The Vice President:
Thank you, Mary Lynne.

01:23:14.556 --> 01:23:15.990
Very well done.

01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:20.628
And let me -- let me maybe
ask a question of the panel.

01:23:21.329 --> 01:23:24.666
I have a feeling
I'm going to get word

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:28.837
that we need to be moving
to our next appointment.

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:34.142
But maybe I could start
with you, Dr. Dittmar, that --

01:23:34.142 --> 01:23:36.544
given your extensive experience
on the Space Station,

01:23:37.045 --> 01:23:42.183
the President has announced
our plan to transition

01:23:42.183 --> 01:23:43.685
to a different model

01:23:44.652 --> 01:23:46.921
for America's presence
in low-Earth orbit.

01:23:46.921 --> 01:23:51.292
One of our previous
panelists said --

01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:53.261
I thought, rather insightfully,

01:23:53.261 --> 01:23:56.698
where we would transition
the government

01:23:56.698 --> 01:24:00.835
to more tenant and customer,
rather than landlord,

01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:05.607
so that we could focus
on human exploration,

01:24:06.741 --> 01:24:08.810
and pushing the boundaries.

01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:11.546
Can -- since you all
represent this industry,

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:15.617
could each of you maybe give me
one minute on where the --

01:24:17.652 --> 01:24:19.788
where are the opportunities,
where are the challenges?

01:24:19.788 --> 01:24:21.156
What should this council
be aware of,

01:24:21.156 --> 01:24:23.458
as we seek to make
that transition?

01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:25.226
And Dr. Dittmar,
on the Space Station, you've --

01:24:26.327 --> 01:24:28.096
I've forgotten more about it
than I'll ever learn.

01:24:28.096 --> 01:24:29.397
Dr. Dittmar:
So, I'll start by saying

01:24:29.397 --> 01:24:32.200
that the demands side

01:24:33.501 --> 01:24:36.604
is as important as
the supply side, in this case.

01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:39.908
So, developing --
finding additional ways

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:40.875
that have already
been discussed,

01:24:40.875 --> 01:24:43.578
but many other ways to
encourage demand, to develop --

01:24:43.578 --> 01:24:45.580
especially in low-Earth orbit
is critical.

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:47.582
I think we also need
to establish some criteria

01:24:47.582 --> 01:24:49.384
for that transition.

01:24:49.384 --> 01:24:50.752
Those should include readiness

01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:53.087
to assume role of
the commercial industry,

01:24:53.087 --> 01:24:54.489
and there are certainly
a number of efforts

01:24:54.489 --> 01:24:55.824
that are under way right now.

01:24:55.824 --> 01:24:57.792
A clear strategy
for continued expanded

01:24:57.792 --> 01:24:59.027
international collaboration,

01:24:59.027 --> 01:25:00.061
both in low-Earth orbit

01:25:00.061 --> 01:25:02.330
and then toward the moon
is very important.

01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:04.599
The framework that guided
the development of the station

01:25:04.599 --> 01:25:06.367
has enabled everything
that's happened there,

01:25:06.367 --> 01:25:08.503
and I think that's critical.

01:25:08.503 --> 01:25:10.505
A plan for ensuring
that critical exploration

01:25:10.505 --> 01:25:12.273
technologies can continue
to be developed.

01:25:12.273 --> 01:25:15.276
So, for example, environmental
control is very important.

01:25:15.276 --> 01:25:18.446
Astronauts like to breathe
they're in deep space.

01:25:18.446 --> 01:25:20.682
So, we need to make sure
that we have a working system

01:25:20.682 --> 01:25:22.083
that will enable
that over a long period

01:25:22.083 --> 01:25:23.318
of time in deep space.

01:25:23.318 --> 01:25:25.286
And then, the nature
of the vehicle itself.

01:25:26.154 --> 01:25:28.156
You know, what is it capable of?

01:25:28.156 --> 01:25:29.491
What is the follow-on
capable of?

01:25:29.491 --> 01:25:31.259
Sort of what do we want to do
with it, going forward?

01:25:31.259 --> 01:25:32.160
The Vice President:
Good, good insights.

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:33.928
Anyone else?
Just a quick shot on --

01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:35.463
Mr. Stroup:
Just very quickly --

01:25:35.463 --> 01:25:37.131
The Vice President:
Tom?

01:25:37.131 --> 01:25:38.800
Mr. Stroup: -- I would also 
address procurement reform because --

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.435
because I think very often,

01:25:40.435 --> 01:25:43.204
as the military is large
customer of the industry,

01:25:43.204 --> 01:25:46.007
making a transition
from viewing themselves

01:25:46.007 --> 01:25:48.643
as purchasing satellites to
purchasing services in addition

01:25:48.643 --> 01:25:52.213
to the unique satellites
that they have a specific need.

01:25:52.213 --> 01:25:55.650
But looking at how they can
acquire satellite services

01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:56.851
more quickly would be important.

01:25:57.418 --> 01:25:59.287
The Vice President:
Great, Kevin, Eric?

01:26:00.154 --> 01:26:01.389
Mr. O'Connell:
Just briefly, I think

01:26:01.389 --> 01:26:03.224
anticipating the kinds
of capabilities

01:26:03.224 --> 01:26:05.059
that are coming forth
in the market --

01:26:05.059 --> 01:26:07.462
paying explicit attention
to U.S. government use,

01:26:07.462 --> 01:26:09.797
to public policy concerns,
et cetera,

01:26:09.797 --> 01:26:12.000
it's something that needs
to be done proactively,

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.434
not wait until people show up

01:26:13.434 --> 01:26:15.036
with a new capability
for licensing.

01:26:17.205 --> 01:26:18.006
Mr. Stallmer:
And I think,

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:19.207
just to touch on
what Mary Lynne said,

01:26:19.207 --> 01:26:22.143
you know, the idea of having
a smooth transition plan,

01:26:22.143 --> 01:26:23.411
avoiding any kind of gap,

01:26:23.945 --> 01:26:26.481
and really utilizing
a lot of the innovation

01:26:26.481 --> 01:26:29.150
and the technology that the
commercial industry is driven --

01:26:29.150 --> 01:26:32.487
is driving right now,
whether it be through habitat --

01:26:32.487 --> 01:26:33.955
you know, habitat modules,

01:26:33.955 --> 01:26:35.857
or you know, new
transportation systems,

01:26:35.857 --> 01:26:38.660
or just the experiments
that are taking place

01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:39.861
on the International
Space Station.

01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:42.697
I think it's -- there's
remarkable technologies

01:26:42.697 --> 01:26:44.299
that are being developed
at a rapid pace,

01:26:44.299 --> 01:26:45.600
and we want to
incorporate them

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.502
throughout the process
of this transition.

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:50.305
The Vice President:
Great, that's great.

01:26:50.305 --> 01:26:52.774
Join me in thanking
this outstanding panel.

01:26:52.774 --> 01:26:54.976
Great insights,
great overview.

01:26:54.976 --> 01:26:57.545
Thank you so much, great job.

01:26:57.545 --> 01:27:01.316
(Applause.)

01:27:01.316 --> 01:27:03.885
Well, the members of
the National Space Council,

01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:06.087
I think this has been
a great discussion.

01:27:06.087 --> 01:27:11.059
Before we adjourn, I'd like
to task a few items to assign

01:27:11.793 --> 01:27:13.661
to Administrator Lightfoot.

01:27:14.796 --> 01:27:17.966
I appreciate you working
with Commerce and State

01:27:17.966 --> 01:27:23.438
to develop a strategy
to develop the framework

01:27:23.438 --> 01:27:24.739
for great cooperation

01:27:24.739 --> 01:27:26.674
with our private
sector partners.

01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:33.081
And as appropriate,
international partners as well.

01:27:34.716 --> 01:27:35.917
And we'd --

01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:40.054
I'd welcome your recommendations
by our meetings

01:27:40.054 --> 01:27:42.624
this fall that we could forward
to the President

01:27:42.624 --> 01:27:45.627
in the form of
a decision memorandum.

01:27:45.627 --> 01:27:47.895
And we already --

01:27:47.895 --> 01:27:52.867
I think we touched
on a number of issues

01:27:52.867 --> 01:27:54.535
in the previous
recommendation,

01:27:54.535 --> 01:27:56.204
but this panel's been
a great affirmation,

01:27:56.204 --> 01:27:58.406
I think, of
the overall direction,

01:27:58.406 --> 01:28:00.174
but we'll take your
steady council on this,

01:28:00.174 --> 01:28:02.110
on an ongoing basis.

01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:04.779
With that, let me thank
all the members

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:08.316
of the National Space Council,

01:28:08.316 --> 01:28:11.185
especially the members
of the Cabinet who are here.

01:28:11.986 --> 01:28:14.455
Distinguished members
of the user advisory group,

01:28:14.455 --> 01:28:16.424
I encourage all of you
that have an interest

01:28:16.424 --> 01:28:18.860
in the work of
the National Space Council

01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:22.430
to avail yourself of
the extraordinary women and men

01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:25.867
who have stepped forward
to offer advice and counsel

01:28:26.768 --> 01:28:29.837
to the work of
the National Space Council.

01:28:29.837 --> 01:28:34.008
I want to thank
the extraordinary men

01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:36.944
and women of
the Kennedy Space Center

01:28:37.545 --> 01:28:39.914
for their hospitality

01:28:39.914 --> 01:28:42.750
and to each
and every one of you,

01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:45.420
thank you for your
great interest in this.

01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:47.388
The work will continue,

01:28:47.388 --> 01:28:50.058
and America is leading
in space again,

01:28:50.692 --> 01:28:51.893
thanks to all of you, thank you.

01:28:51.893 --> 01:28:53.294
God bless you,
it's good to be with you all.

01:28:53.294 --> 01:28:54.395
(Applause.)
