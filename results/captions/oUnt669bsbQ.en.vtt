00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.230
You look rested for
someone who was at the Oscars last night.

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:04.895
Did you go out afterwards?

00:00:04.895 --> 00:00:06.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I made my one stop.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.910
I breezed through.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.740
&gt;&gt; Drive by at the Vanity Fair party,
that's it.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.950
&gt;&gt; That's it?
&gt;&gt; Of course, it was down the hill from my

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.700
house, so it was easy this year.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.340
&gt;&gt; It's usually a lot further away.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.670
This year it was Was closer so.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:16.240
&gt;&gt; The party?

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.780
&gt;&gt; Boom, straight up the hill.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.175
&gt;&gt; Good, now and
wasn't Jimmy great last night?

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:21.450
Didn't you think he did a good job?

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah, he's no Ellen DeGeneres but
he's all right.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.530
&gt;&gt; Well you know, nobody is, nobody is.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.870
&gt;&gt; Everybody's trying to rip,
you know, your thing off.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.400
I actually watched the Grammy's they were
trying to rip off your whole selfie thing,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.640
it didn't work so well.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.044
&gt;&gt; I saw with them doing
the karaoke in the car.

00:00:37.044 --> 00:00:38.622
Well.
&lt;&lt; Yours was way doper.

00:00:38.622 --> 00:00:39.212
[LAUGH].

00:00:39.212 --> 00:00:40.310
&lt;&lt; You're very sweet.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.290
You're very sweet.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.246
So who were you sitting with?

00:00:43.246 --> 00:00:44.490
&gt;&gt; My wife.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.000
&gt;&gt; And who else?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.240
Who else was around you?

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.262
&gt;&gt; Everybody in Hollywood.

00:00:47.262 --> 00:00:49.053
&gt;&gt; Aha [LAUGH].

00:00:49.053 --> 00:00:50.144
&gt;&gt; All the hopefuls.

00:00:50.144 --> 00:00:52.208
&gt;&gt; Great.
Everybody sitting there pins and needles.

00:00:52.208 --> 00:00:54.108
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I was relaxed cause I wasn't up for

00:00:54.108 --> 00:00:56.009
anything so
it was cool to able to be there.

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:59.630
&gt;&gt; So you go even though you're not,
so you like going to those things.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.470
&gt;&gt; I was presenting.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.060
I was you know, you always go for

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.745
the goody basket, but-
&gt;&gt; Is that right?

00:01:04.745 --> 00:01:06.410
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Now they stopped giving them to

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.950
presenters.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.565
Now they just give them to people who
are nominated, so I'm done with that.

00:01:09.565 --> 00:01:11.175
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So, now you're not gonna present?

00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:11.965
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
[NOISE]

00:01:11.965 --> 00:01:12.558
&gt;&gt; You're only gonna

00:01:12.558 --> 00:01:13.340
go if you're nominate.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.770
&gt;&gt; Only if I'm getting a goody bag.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.126
&gt;&gt; Well good-
&gt;&gt; It's all about the basket.

00:01:17.126 --> 00:01:18.206
&gt;&gt; Yeah LAUGH] Is it?

00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:21.040
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Do they have that good of stuff that

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.810
it's worth going?

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.220
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean years ago it used to be
&gt;&gt; A lot of money.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.440
The first time I went I
remember going to rehearsal and

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.470
they give you a basket at rehearsal and
Jack Nicholson was nominated that year.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.530
He came out with this basket and

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.350
he actually gave it to somebody in
the crowd that was in the back waiting.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.830
&gt;&gt; Wow, that's nice.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.967
&gt;&gt; Worth tons of money.

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:44.775
It was lots of great stuff in there.

00:01:44.775 --> 00:01:46.396
&gt;&gt; Now let me ask you a question.

00:01:46.396 --> 00:01:51.940
Well, just said that your movies
have made about $17 billion.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Not that you make $17 billion.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.360
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; But you earn a good living.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.110
&gt;&gt; I do all right.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.481
&gt;&gt; You don't really need a free basket,
you're doing okay.

00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:01.364
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Everybody likes-

00:02:01.364 --> 00:02:01.928
&gt;&gt; Free stuff.

00:02:01.928 --> 00:02:02.535
&gt;&gt; Free stuff.

00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:03.106
&gt;&gt; Yeah right.

00:02:03.106 --> 00:02:08.663
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; That's

00:02:08.663 --> 00:02:12.469
my answer to the question,
what's the best thing about being famous?

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:13.020
Free stuff.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.710
&gt;&gt; The free stuff.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.510
&gt;&gt; Its so backwards though,

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.226
I mean when we're-
&gt;&gt; Free stuff.

00:02:17.226 --> 00:02:20.439
&gt;&gt; When we're- [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; When we're struggling, as a stand up,

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.589
you know, if I was an opener I had to
pay for my food, if I was a middle act,

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:28.228
I got it half off,
if I was a headliner, I got it for free.

00:02:28.228 --> 00:02:31.830
So like you, when you're struggling
they don't give you free stuff, and

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.660
all of a sudden we make it and
people just send you stuff all the time.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.280
&gt;&gt; It was crazy.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.150
&gt;&gt; it's not fair.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.340
So when you are and as I say that
many movies that you've been in,

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.850
that to make 17 billion
that's really impressive.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
I'm still trying to catch Harrison though

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.100
&gt;&gt; Harrison is still ahead of me

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.920
because of Star Wars last year.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.893
So I gotta make,
I think my assistant told me I was like $8

00:02:52.893 --> 00:02:57.780
to maybe $150 million or
somewhere behind him.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.720
&gt;&gt; That's close.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.265
&gt;&gt; But yeah,

00:02:59.265 --> 00:03:01.017
I got a chance to grab him with-
&gt;&gt; With this-

00:03:01.017 --> 00:03:01.867
&gt;&gt; Either this movie.

00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:02.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.340
&gt;&gt; Triple X is doing really well in China.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.200
So I might catch him soon so
it would be that.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.495
Or this movie, or
whenever The Incredibles 2 comes out.

00:03:11.495 --> 00:03:12.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
That's a given, done.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.870
&gt;&gt; For sure, yes.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.030
You will win.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.860
And then you will make
the most of any other actor.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.390
&gt;&gt; And then I'll be back on the highest

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.880
grossing actor in
the history of Hollywood.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.180
I had that title for about five years.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.550
And Harrison.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.770
Made one movie and caught me.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:29.543
&gt;&gt; Damn him.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:30.049
&gt;&gt; Damn him.

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:30.556
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:03:30.556 --> 00:03:31.786
&gt;&gt; And when you catch yourself,

00:03:31.786 --> 00:03:34.417
like if you're in your hotel
room flipping through and

00:03:34.417 --> 00:03:38.070
you see a movie of yours come on,
will you, do you like to watch yourself?

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.833
&gt;&gt; I love watching my movies.

00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:40.832
&gt;&gt; You do?
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:03:40.832 --> 00:03:41.962
&gt;&gt; Yeah that's why I'm here.

00:03:41.962 --> 00:03:44.761
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:44.761 --> 00:03:47.992
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; What-

00:03:47.992 --> 00:03:51.270
&gt;&gt; I mean back when I was doing theater in

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.440
New York, I always wanted to see
the play I was in with me in it.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.335
And that's impossible.

00:03:56.335 --> 00:03:58.880
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So when I got a chance to do movies it

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.060
was like like heaven, it's like-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.290
&gt;&gt; I can watch me all the time.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.815
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:04:02.815 --> 00:04:05.065
&gt;&gt; So if I'm at home channel surfing and

00:04:05.065 --> 00:04:07.800
there's nothing on that I
really wanna watch, I can

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.920
just throw my name into the search engine
and some will come up that I will see.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:11.560
&gt;&gt; Of course they will.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.234
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; We're back with Samuel L Jackson,

00:04:14.234 --> 00:04:16.616
and so
you're good friends with Judge Judy.

00:04:16.616 --> 00:04:17.813
&gt;&gt; Yes, that's my friend.

00:04:17.813 --> 00:04:21.180
We have dinner at least four or
five times a year.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.160
&gt;&gt; And you love watching her show.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.110
&gt;&gt; All the time.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love her show too.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.850
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:26.500
&gt;&gt; She's hilarious.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.935
She says some pretty, I mean she's
a no-nonsense person, so are you.

00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:33.010
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And so we thought we're play a game,

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.710
and it's called Judy or Jackson.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.070
Let me go first cuz I don't
wanna be influenced by you.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.320
I don't even know if you'll know,
but we're gonna put up a quote, and

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.190
we're gonna use these paddles and guess
Who said it, you or Judge Judy and so

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.230
let's see the first one.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.350
You're going to regret the fact that
you opened your eyes this morning!

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.336
I'm gonna say that that's you.

00:04:53.336 --> 00:04:57.369
&gt;&gt; Its, Really?

00:04:57.369 --> 00:04:58.244
Wow.

00:04:58.244 --> 00:05:02.435
[APPLAUSE] Alright.

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:05.410
[APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Are these quotes from his movies or

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.610
just like in a-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.770
That's why it sounded like-
&gt;&gt; I don't say anything else

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:10.410
that's poignant.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's-
&gt;&gt; Everything I

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.450
say is important in a movie.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.960
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.720
&gt;&gt; Or it's a tee shirt.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.080
&gt;&gt; I'm as serious as a heart attack.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:20.663
I'm gonna say that's her.

00:05:20.663 --> 00:05:24.426
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; No-

00:05:24.426 --> 00:05:27.771
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:05:27.771 --> 00:05:28.749
&gt;&gt; 0 for 2.

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:30.085
Alright lets-
&gt;&gt; I'm slaying this game.

00:05:30.085 --> 00:05:32.053
&gt;&gt; You really are good at it.

00:05:32.053 --> 00:05:36.826
Let's see

00:05:36.826 --> 00:05:43.190
the next one.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.370
[LAUGH] [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE]
The one time I follow you.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.870
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.920
&gt;&gt; You don't remember that?

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.870
&gt;&gt; Who did I say that to, David Caruso?

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:55.670
He's in that movie.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:56.760
Or maybe I said it to Nick Cage.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.760
&gt;&gt; You have to watch it tonight.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.430
&gt;&gt; Okay, I'll do that.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.955
I will.
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:05:58.955 --> 00:06:01.420
[APPLAUSE] Do we have another one?

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.800
&gt;&gt; Wow
&gt;&gt; If you lie to me,

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.049
I'll wipe the floor with you worse
than anybody that's ever tackled you.

00:06:09.049 --> 00:06:12.750
[LAUGH] [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Good looking out.
