00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.179
Seven Biblical Reasons why 2019 could really
be

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.490
the year of the Escape of the Bride;

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.509
the gathering together of the Elect;

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.230
and the taking of the Multitude out of the Tribulation.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.740
Number One: 2019 is the 1335th year.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.250
In Daniel chapter twelve it says there will
be a Time of Trouble

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.020
and at that time the people will be delivered,
everyone that shall be found in the book.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.020
The Book is explained in Revelation as the
Book of Life.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.810
Revelation 21:2,27 says that those who enter
the Holy City in heaven

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.700
(the Bride) are written in the Book of Life.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.860
So Daniel chapter 12 is talking about the
final time of trouble

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.100
and the deliverance of the Bride to heaven.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.420
Then it gives a timing clue at the end of
the chapter in verses 11 and 12.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.680
It says: “And from the time that the daily
sacrifice shall be taken away,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.580
and the Abomination that makes desolate set
up,

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.700
there shall be a thousand two hundred and
ninety days.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.460
Blessed is he that waits and comes to the
thousand three hundred and thirty-five days.”

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.030
In order to understand this, first, we have
to find when the Abomination was set up.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.510
This is found in Daniel chapter 11.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.390
For the full Daniel 11 timeline please see
the video linked here.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.500
In short, Daniel 11 verse 31 describes the
setting up of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.810
by the King of the North in 685 CE.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.650
This is confirmed by the fulfillment of Daniel
12:11.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.920
From the time the daily sacrifice was first
taken away by the King of the North in 606 BC

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.260
until the Abomination was set up by the King
of the North in 685 CE

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.110
was exactly 1290 years.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.210
The Bible tells us days can also represent
years in Ezekiel 4:6 and Numbers 14:34.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.220
So verse 11 was fulfilled in 685 CE:

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.400
1290 years from the taking away of the first
daily in Jerusalem (606 BC)

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.380
to the setting up of the Abomination in Jerusalem
(685 CE).

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.820
Then it says Blessed are those who come to
the 1335th day.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.040
1335 years from the setting up of the Abomination
in 685 CE

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.140
ends in the year 2020.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.820
However, verse 12 says the blessed year is
the 1335th year.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.500
Not the completion of 1335 years,

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.180
but the final 1335th year itself.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.160
2020 represents the completion of 1335 years

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.560
and 2019 represents the start of the final
1335th year.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.160
In other words, 2019 is the Blessed Year;
the 1335th day.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.480
Number 2: It is immediately after the Tribulation
of the Days.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.870
In Matthew 24 Jesus gives more details about
the timeline of events

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.750
starting with the Abomination of Desolation
that Daniel talked about

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.390
and ending with the gathering of the Elect.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.270
In verses 15 and 16 it says when you see the
Abomination of Desolation

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.360
That Daniel talked about stand in the Holy
Place,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.489
Then those in Judea will flee into the mountains.

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.860
And in verse 21 it explains that the fleeing
into the mountains starts the Tribulation period.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.160
This is paralleled in Revelation 12 verse
6.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.040
It says the Woman will flee into the wilderness
for 1260 days.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.610
The word used in both Matthew 24:16 and Revelation
12:6 is the same:

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.599
The word is Pheugo: Flee.

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:42.830
So Daniel 12, Revelation 12, and Matthew 24
are providing a timeline.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.989
Each one giving more details.

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.610
Daniel 11 and 12 tell us when the Abomination
occurred

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.970
By laying out the exact number of years between
specific historical events

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.580
That must match an exact timeline.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.720
Matthew 24 then tells us that after this Abomination,

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.580
Those in Judea will flee and the Tribulation
will start at that fleeing.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:13.120
Then Revelation 12 adds that the fleeing into
the wilderness will last exactly 1260 days

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.540
And before the fleeing there will be a sign
in heaven.

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.800
The sign of Revelation 12 is explained in
the video linked here.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.120
But in short, it occurred in both 686 and
the year 2012.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.820
In 686 it occurred during the building
of the Dome of the Rock.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.160
So we had the fulfillment of Daniel 12:11,

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.479
the fulfillment of Matthew 24:15,

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.180
and the fulfillment of Revelation 12:1-5 at
that time (685-686).

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.819
That is how we know the Tribulation started
shortly after 685 CE.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:57.140
Matthew 24 continues on to verse 29 where
it confirms that the Tribulation it refers to

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.720
Is the Tribulation of the Days.

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.430
This is important because Daniel 12 also talks
about a time of trouble

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.820
That lasts for a Time, Times, and Half a Time.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.420
In fact, there are three time periods representing
Trouble or Tribulation:

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.949
There is the Time, Times, and Half a Time

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:22.120
Found in Daniel 7:25, Daniel 12:7, and Revelation
12:14.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.070
This is the final time of trouble, and we
know this because Revelation 12:14

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.639
Tells us it occurs at the end of the 1260
days.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.600
The Woman in Revelation 12 represents Judea
in verse 6

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.419
But in verse 14 the Woman represents the Multitude of All Tribes and Nations.

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.930
For more on this, please see the video on
Revelation 12 linked here.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.400
This final time of trouble is also a period
of 42 months

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.659
explained in Revelation 11:2 and 13:5.

00:05:55.659 --> 00:06:00.689
For more on this watch the Revelation 11 and
13 videos.

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:04.639
You will notice that these three Biblical
references to times of trouble

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:10.020
Are described using different words: there
is the Trouble of Times,

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.449
the Trouble of Months, and the Trouble of
Days.

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:22.979
The trouble of Days is the 1260 Days explained
in Revelation 11:3 and 12:6.

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:29.719
Jesus explained in Matthew 24:29 that the
Tribulation that comes after the Abomination

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:31.970
Is the Tribulation of the Days.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.590
In other words, it represents the 1260 day
period,

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.060
which we now understand is a 1260 year period.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:47.599
So by solving Daniel 11 and 12, Revelation
11 and 12, and Matthew 24

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.080
We can see the timeline:

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:56.160
First, the Daily was taken away by the first
King of the North in 606 BC,

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.219
next, 1290 years later, the Abomination of
Desolation was set up

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:04.479
by the King of the North in 685 CE.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:11.840
While that Abomination was being set up, the
sign of Revelation 12 occurred in the sky in 686 CE.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.960
Then shortly after that Judea fled out of
Jerusalem

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.270
And that represented the start of the 1260
years.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.710
If we could find the exact moment of the fleeing,

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.740
then we would be able to easily find the
end of the 1260 years.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:33.760
And Jesus said Immediately after this 1260
years the stars will fall

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.969
and the elect will be gathered by the angels.

00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:45.140
In 1701 author Robert Fleming wrote about
why he believed the 1260 years started in 758

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.720
and would end in the year 2018.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.319
He was not alone.

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:54.189
There were many authors then, and still are
other researchers today

00:07:54.189 --> 00:08:00.240
who believe the 1260 years started around
the early development of the Holy Roman Empire.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:06.220
Upon current examination of the scriptures,
it is fairly obvious that Revelation 11 and 12

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:11.920
give a timeline of historical events that
started around the rise of the Holy Roman Empire

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.179
and continue through the modern era.

00:08:14.179 --> 00:08:18.240
For more on that, see the Revelation 11 and
12 videos.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:23.040
There is no way to know exactly when the Tribulation
of Days started

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:28.060
Because we cannot know exactly when the fleeing
into the Wilderness began.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:34.460
But if Robert Fleming is right, and the Tribulation
of the Days did start in 758

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.260
then its end would have been 2018

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:44.460
And the period Immediately After 2018 could
represent 2019.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.290
There is a clue about that in Revelation
11.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:53.300
It talks about the 1260 days that the Two
Witnesses walk the earth.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:58.880
The Two Witnesses are Two Candlesticks out
of a total of Seven Candlesticks.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.880
Earth’s total population is currently in
the Seven Billion range

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.860
and is not expected to reach Eight Billion
until 2024.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.160
The population of Christians and Jews is Two
Billion.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:14.340
For more on this, watch the video,

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:19.030
but the Two Billion Christians and Jews represent
the Two Witnesses

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:24.410
walking the Great City, Babylon the Great,
that covers all seven continents.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:28.160
The fact that these Two Billion out of a total
of Seven Billion (2 out of 7 Candlesticks)

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:35.530
Only occurs now, at the exact end of the 1260
year period may not be coincidence.

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:36.820
But there is more.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:43.200
Revelation 11 verse 10 specifically says that
before the end of the 1260 days

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.740
the people of Earth will be making merry and
sending gifts to one another.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.710
Please watch the video for that translation.

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:56.310
The making merry and sending gifts is an obvious
reference to December.

00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:02.490
Even in ancient Roman Times, December was
the month to make merry and send gifts.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:09.350
So the prophecy is telling us the that 1260
days will end in December.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:15.420
In other words, the 1260 days will end at
the end of the Roman year.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:21.600
That means that the “Immediately After”
refers to the following year!

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:33.240
So if the 1260 years ended in December 2018, then 2019
represents the time period

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.600
Immediately After the Tribulation!

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.300
In other words, the time the Elect will be
gathered together!

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:47.260
Number 3: It is the end of the 400 year affliction.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:54.280
In Genesis 15:13 Abraham is told that his
seed will be a stranger in a land that is not theirs

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:59.380
they will serve a nation of people there and
be afflicted four hundred years.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:03.790
and that nation that they shall serve will
be judged by God.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:10.270
In Deuteronomy 28-30 there is a list of curses
that will befall the seed of Abraham.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:15.860
The first clue about this nation is that it
is as swift as the Eagle.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:24.580
In verse 49 it says it is a nation from far,
from the end of the Earth, as swift as the Eagle.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.680
A nation whose language they will not understand.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:35.310
And in verse 68, it says they will be brought
into Egypt again with ships.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:42.930
This is important because the literal land
of Egypt is accessible by land from Jerusalem.

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.170
Its not talking about literal Egypt.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:49.150
Its talking about Babylon the Great.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:56.630
Revelation 17 verses 5 and 18 explain that
Babylon the Great is called the Great City

00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:03.760
and Revelation 11 verse 8 tells us the Great
City is also spiritually called Egypt and Sodom.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:08.900
So the Egypt that the descendants of Abraham
travel to by ships

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.700
is Babylon the Great.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:15.600
And there, it says they will be sold to their
enemies as slaves.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:23.680
In Deuteronomy 28 verse 36 it confirms that
this is a nation that was not known to their fathers.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.320
So it was not Ancient Egypt.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.670
For more on how we know this did not represent
ancient Egypt

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.280
you can watch the video linked here.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:39.720
But it tells us clearly in Deuteronomy 29
verses 22 and 23

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:46.020
That the Afflicted will see the Fire and
Brimstone rain down from heaven

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.180
Just like Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:53.160
Luke 17:29 and 30 says at the coming of
the Son of Man

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.560
It will rain Fire and Brimstone like Sodom
and Gomorrah.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:02.180
This is the end of the Tribulation of Days
in Matthew 24:29, 30.

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:07.680
So Deuteronomy 29 indicates that the Affliction
is going to end

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.100
when the 1260 Days end!

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:18.340
This is confirmed in Deuteronomy 30:3-5 where
it says that when this curse happens

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:25.360
God will return, gather them from all nations,
even gather them in heaven,

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:29.140
And then return them to their own land.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:34.840
This is the gathering of the Elect in heaven
in Matthew 24:31

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:39.480
and the return of the Bride in Revelation
21:2.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:45.370
The return to their homeland is the Bride’s
return to Earth!

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:51.100
So if the curse or Affliction ends when the
1260 years end,

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.130
then when did it begin?

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:59.170
The clues tell us this was a bringing of slaves
into a nation belonging to Babylon the Great

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:02.220
That was only accessible by ships.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.590
That this nation is represented by an Eagle,

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.420
And it was not known by their fathers.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:16.010
I think it is obvious this refers to the slave
ships brought across the Atlantic to the Americas.

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:21.730
The first slaves ships arrived in America
in the year 1619.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.760
If this represented the beginning of the Affliction,

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:29.060
then 400 years later ends in 2019!

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:36.180
The exact year that represents the time period:
“Immediately After the Tribulation!”

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:44.080
Number 4: It is after 70 years have been accomplished
of Israel serving Babylon.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:49.220
In Jeremiah 25:1-12 we are told that the nations
around Jerusalem

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.810
will serve the King of Babylon for Seventy
Years,

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:55.660
And once those Seventy Years are accomplished

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.420
the King of Babylon will be punished.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:02.600
This punishment clearly represents the fall
of Babylon the Great

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.240
for multiple reasons explained in the playlist linked at the end of this video.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:13.180
But in short, this is clear in verse 33 where
it says the Whole Earth will suffer at this event.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:17.800
It refers to the punishment of the King of
Babylon the Great,

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:24.370
And this is explained as the Eighth King in
Revelation 17:7-11.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:30.120
The first Six Kings were Ancient Babylon,
Persia, Greece,

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.279
and the Western, Eastern, and Holy Roman Empires.

00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:38.690
The Seventh was the League of Nations and
the Eighth is the United Nations.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:44.980
For more on this please watch the playlist linked at the end of this video.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.320
The United Nations created the country of
Israel

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:52.100
in the region surrounding Jerusalem in 1947

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.480
And it was officially declared in 1948.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.160
Therefore, the nations around Jerusalem started
serving

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.290
the Eighth King of Babylon the Great in 1948,

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:07.800
And seventy years later ended in 2018.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.880
So the seventy years have now been
accomplished

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.440
of the nations around Jerusalem serving the
eighth King of Babylon.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:20.400
Number 5: Jesus provided a parable that goes
along with this.

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:25.770
In Matthew 24:32-34 he says that one generation
will not pass

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:28.750
From the time the Fig Tree puts forth leaves

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:32.600
until all the things he mentioned have come
to pass.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:37.340
In other words, everything he mentions from
verse 1 to verse 32,

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.730
(including the falling of the stars and the
gathering of the Elect)

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:47.940
Will be completed within one generation after
the Fig Tree puts forth leaves.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:52.740
The Fig Tree represents Israel, as explained
in Hosea 9:10,

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:58.589
And one generation equals seventy to eighty
years in Psalm 90:10.

00:16:58.589 --> 00:17:02.400
Since the nation of Israel was established
in 1948,

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.320
Seventy years later would be 2018

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.700
And Eighty years later would be 2028.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:15.040
This means that generation will end sometime
between 2018 and 2028,

00:17:15.049 --> 00:17:21.539
And Jesus said the gathering of the Elect
will occur Before the end of that generation.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:26.320
So the gathering of the Elect would occur before
2028!

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:31.100
Number 6: It is in the midst of the final
seven years.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:36.960
In Daniel 9:24-27 Gabriel gives a very specific
timeline

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.830
That ends with a flood in the midst of a seven
year period.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:47.220
For details on this see the Daniel 9 video
in the playlist linked at the end of this video.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:52.540
But in short, Gabriel says there will be a
total of Seventy Seven

00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:57.279
From the Commandment to Restore Jerusalem
until the End of Sins.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:02.020
If the Commandment was the United Nations
vote to create the nation of Israel

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:09.120
Then the Seventy Seven would start in 1947
and end in 2024.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:15.749
And more specifically, during this period
he says a man called Messiah will show up

00:18:15.749 --> 00:18:21.179
After Seven, Seven, and sixty-two Shavuots.

00:18:21.179 --> 00:18:24.379
The man the world called “Messiah” was
Obama.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:33.580
The Seven, Seven, is 14 years after 1947,
which landed in 1961, the year of Obama’s birth,

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:41.379
And the 62 Shavuots ended in 2009, the year
Obama became President of the United States.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:48.860
Then it says this man will confirm a covenant with many starting a period of seven years.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:55.100
Obama won the Peace Prize in 2009 for confirming
the Non-Proliferation Treaty

00:18:55.110 --> 00:19:00.799
Which is a Treaty between all the world nations
belonging to the United Nations.

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:03.289
In other words, a Treaty with many.

00:19:03.289 --> 00:19:07.680
This Treaty is usually confirmed by each successive
President.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:12.110
So next it says the man called Messiah will
be cut off

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:18.639
And the end by a flood will occur during the
reign of the Prince or Leader after that.

00:19:18.639 --> 00:19:23.879
The man called Messiah was President for Seven
Years after the Peace Prize

00:19:23.879 --> 00:19:27.190
From 2009 to 2016.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:31.940
The Prince or Leader that shall come was elected
in 2016

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.129
and began his leadership in 2017.

00:19:35.129 --> 00:19:42.730
Seven years from 2017 ends in 2024; the exact
end of the Seventy Seven.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:47.620
The alternate translation of verses 26 and
27 say:

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:52.520
“After sixty two Shavuots Messiah cut off,
not people.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:57.900
Leader come in, perhaps to go to ruin, city
sacredness end,

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:02.400
Flood, end, battle, desolated, cut.

00:20:02.409 --> 00:20:09.980
Strong covenant many, one seven, half seven
cease, sacrifice, gift on the wing,

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:14.840
Detested thing desolated, desolated, even
complete,

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.119
Cut, pour forth, desolated.”

00:20:18.119 --> 00:20:20.850
The flood mentioned in this verse is important

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:25.330
because Revelation 12:15 also mentions this
flood.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:29.900
It occurs when the Woman in verse 14 escapes
the serpent.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.919
The Dragon, it says, causes the flood,

00:20:32.919 --> 00:20:38.539
And verse 4 tells us the Dragon casts the
stars to the Earth with its tail.

00:20:38.539 --> 00:20:45.220
The Dragon, on one level, represents a Comet
that casts an asteroid to Earth.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:53.320
This asteroid is the Millstone that hits the
sea destroying Babylon in Revelation 18:21.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:59.220
This is the waves that will cover Babylon
in Jeremiah 51:42.

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:04.850
It is the Rain of Fire and Brimstone in Luke
17:29-30.

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:09.980
It is the Falling of the Stars in Matthew
24:29.

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:14.919
This asteroid impact occurs Immediately After
the Tribulation of the Days

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.560
And it causes a tsunami because it hits the
sea.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:24.380
A tsunami that Daniel 9 says will occur in
the midst of the final seven years.

00:21:24.389 --> 00:21:29.720
The final seven years started when the man
called Messiah was cut off

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.220
And the next leader took office.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:36.420
This seven year period started in 2017.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:42.720
However, the end in 2024 represents the end
of all sins

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:47.679
And the flood occurs in the midst of the final
seven years.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:52.820
That means the flood (asteroid impact) will
occur sometime between

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.000
2017 and 2024.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.840
But we know Revelation 13:5 tells us the Beast
will continue for 42 months.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:08.520
This is another reason we know the final time
of trouble of 3.5 years (42 months)

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:12.820
Occurs after the 1260 years.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:20.440
The asteroid hits but the Beast is able to
continue, despite this, for 42 months

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:25.330
Which is 3.5 years and a Time, Times, and
Half a Time.

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:30.039
If the complete End of all Sins occurs by
2024,

00:22:30.039 --> 00:22:34.249
Then the final Time of Trouble must occur
before that.

00:22:34.249 --> 00:22:38.300
This indicates that the final 3.5 years must
start,

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:43.059
either before, or at the very latest, by 2020.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:51.340
Daniel 9:27 indicates the flood will occur
in the midst or the middle of the final seven years.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:57.180
If the final seven years are indeed 2017 to
2024,

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.320
Then the exact middle point would occur in
2020.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:08.559
Many people think it must occur exactly 1260
days from the start of the seven years.

00:23:08.559 --> 00:23:11.480
However, Daniel doesn’t say that.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:17.139
We know, at this point, that the 1260 days
refer to years,

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:21.480
the 1290 days were complete in 685,

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:25.340
and the 1335 days end in 2020,

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:30.460
With the final 1335th year starting in 2019.

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:36.400
Daniel 9 is not referring to the setting up
of the Abomination of Desolation.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:42.780
Instead, it is referring to the overspreading
of Multiple Abominations.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:48.420
So the flood, Daniel says, will occur in the
midst of the final seven years.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:53.570
Perhaps in the middle, but not necessarily
the exact middle.

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:59.360
Instead, he says it will occur “in the midst”
of the final seven years.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:05.380
In other words, somewhere between 2017 and
2024.

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:12.029
And this flood represents the escape of the
Woman in Revelation 12:14

00:24:12.029 --> 00:24:17.200
Which is the Multitude of all Tribes and Nations
in Revelation 7.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:24.200
Number 7: It is seven years after
the sign of the escape in Revelation 12.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.629
The Sign of Revelation 12 occurred in 686
CE

00:24:28.629 --> 00:24:32.179
at the setting up of the Abomination of Desolation

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:38.880
and it also occurred in 2012 on the exact
date of the ancient Feast of Trumpets!

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:42.440
That sign occurs before the escape

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:48.980
and 2019 represents the end of Seven Years
from that sign.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:54.720
For more on that please see the playlist at the end of this video.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:59.500
Those are the seven reasons that 2019 may
really be:

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:03.420
1. The 1335th year that the Blessed have been
waiting for.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:10.040
2. The time of the gathering of the Elect immediately
after the Tribulation of 1260 years.

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:13.020
3. The end of the 400 year Affliction.

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:17.680
4. The year Babylon is punished after 70 years
have been accomplished.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.400
5. Within the Fig Tree generation.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:24.540
6. The time of the flood in the midst of the
final Seven Years

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:30.220
and 7. The escape from the serpent seven years after
the sign in Revelation 12.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:35.400
For more details on any of this, please see
the playlist linked here.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.900
