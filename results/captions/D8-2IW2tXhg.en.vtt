00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.090
As a man who throughout his entire life lusted
for unlimited power, Palpatine seemed to not

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.340
genuinely care for anything or anyone else
but attaining said goal.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.779
However there may have been at least one person
Palpatine actually did care for and perhaps

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.630
even love in his life.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.800
Her name was Sly Moore, a reserved Umbaran
female who’s life was surrounded by rumors

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.940
as the public believed that she and Emperor
Palpatine had a romantic relationship with

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.940
each other.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.460
With some of them going as far as giving her
the unofficial title of “Queen of the Empire”.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.230
These rumors seemed to be based off of Palpatine’s
public interactions with Sly Moore, as they

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.640
were kind of seen as a couple at times.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.130
We actually get a glimpse of said couple like
interaction from them in Episode 3, where

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.180
right before Anakin enters Palpatine's private
Opera house chamber, we see him and Sly Moore

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.160
laughing together as they sat next to each
other enjoying the show.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.789
Also apparently Sly Moore was the mother of
Palpatine’s secret son, Triclops, who was

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.710
created after she supposedly impregnated herself
with Palpatine's DNA.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.549
So what made her so special and why did Palpatine
seem to care for her so much, and why did

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.460
she herself seem to care so much for him?

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.360
Well this possibly might have to do with how
they first met and their relationship afterwards.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.340
When she was born, Sly Moore was said to have
been force sensitive.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.369
But before the Jedi Order could take her,
she was instead kidnapped by Darth Maul on

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.540
orders of Palpatine, presumably so the force
sensitive child could be used for dark side

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.710
experiments.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.270
Experiments that took place within the asteroid
Cron Drift where she was subjected to ancient

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.570
Sith Lord spirits that mentally and spiritually
assaulted her.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.480
Despite being forced to undergo this torment
for months, she remained sane as her strong

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.590
will pushed her through the dark side experiments.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.540
Perhaps after seeing how strong she was, Palpatine
decided to take her under his wing and forge

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.070
her into a powerful assist of his.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.180
He did this by staging a rescue mission for
her, to which under the guise of the humble

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.850
Senator from Naboo, Palpatine made it look
like he rescued her from the asteroid, making

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.600
her believe that he had no connection to the
original kidnappers.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.169
After nursing her back to health, Palpatine
took care of her and began educating her in

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:18.669
politics, all the while keeping her a secret
and safe from potential enemies.

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:21.920
An interesting contrast with how he treated
her compared to Darth Maul.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.660
Where with Darth Maul Palpatine went out of
his way to abuse the poor Zabrak and to constantly

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.230
remind him with the fact of how little he
cared for him, while with Sly Moore he treated

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.780
her as if she were his daughter.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.290
Anyway, over the years they formed a strong
sense of trust among each other, so much so,

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.919
that Palpatine eventually revealed to her
that he was force sensitive just like her

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.060
and that he was in fact a Sith Lord.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.680
Though it’s unknown if he told her that
he was the one who ordered her kidnapping

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.070
when she was younger.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.160
He eventually told her of his plan to take
over the galaxy, and after she proclaimed

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.820
eternal loyalty to him, Palpatine had her
become one of his most trusted aides in the

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.350
Galactic Senate.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.880
When he became Supreme Chancellor of the Republic,
Moore quickly ascended to the position of

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.630
Senior Administrative Aide where she could
be remain at his side at all times.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.280
It was later rumored that Moore blackmailed
the previous Staff Aide Sei Taria into stepping

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.910
down so that she could take her place.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.751
As Staff Aide her duties consisted of helping
organize the Chancellor's schedules, meeting

00:03:24.751 --> 00:03:28.979
with other figures on behalf of the Chancellor,
taking notes on the Chancellor's meetings

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:33.440
and ideas, as well as helping form policy
to be presented to the senate.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.030
On top of her formal duties, she was also
entrusted by Palpatine to use her force sensitivity

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.840
and her native species’ natural mind-clouding
abilities to impersonate Darth Sidious whenever

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.460
he needed her to do so.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.880
And Palpatine did this as a means to convince
his pawns that he and Darth Sidious were separate

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.980
people, as when Moore was impersonating Darth
Sidious and communicating with his minions,

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.810
Palpatine would make sure he was somewhere
in the public around the same time to make

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.510
it seem like they both were at separate places
at the same time.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.820
So none of his minions could ever imagine
linking the two together.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.880
After the formation of the Empire, Sly Moore
was one of the first members to be appointed

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.430
to the Imperial Ruling Council, which acted
as the Emperor’s inner circle.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.470
It was around this time that the public began
to believe that she and Palpatine had a romantic

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.170
relationship going on, due to how close she
was to him and how they acted around each

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.260
other.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.030
One of her first duties in the Empire was
to oversee the training of captured Jedi padawans

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.600
and other force sensitives on the planet Byss,
where they were converted and trained to become

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.940
dark side servants of the Emperor.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.010
She had them tortured and pitted against each
other if they refused to submit, with some

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.430
even being killed if they refused to serve
the Empire.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.340
On top of that, she was also interested in
Dark side experiments.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.980
She was in a way inspired by Palpatine’s
old master, Darth Plagueis, wishing to continue

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.280
his tests involving manipulating midi-chlorians
to create life.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.100
Apparently her experiments with the manipulations
of midi-chlorians was how she created Palpatine's

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.550
son, by using his midi-chlorian rich DNA to
impregnate herself so she could give birth

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:07.790
to a powerful being.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.400
It was rumored that when she became pregnant
from the DNA, that she retired to her home

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.740
planet Umbara where she died when giving birth
to Triclops.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.220
Which if true would explain why Palpatine
disliked his son so much, to the point of

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.570
making him into a slave and sending him to
the spice mines after his many failures of

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.540
being trained as a dark sider.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.170
As he was the cause of his lover’s death.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.250
But then again those were just rumors, so
Sly Moore’s ultimate fate is left unknown.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.910
Now it’s possible that Palpatine loved Sly
Moore not only because he raised her up himself

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.020
like she were his daughter, but also because
they had very similar personalities.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.230
Umbarans were naturally known to be very manipulative
people who craved power and influence.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.670
Just like Palpatine.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.090
But they were also known for having a very
dark sense of humor, so much so that ordinary

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.150
beings tended to be disgusted by their jokes.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:12.150
But Palpatine was clearly no ordinary being,
and he actually had a 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:52.970
very dark sense 
of humor himself, to th
