00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:22.808
It's rather tough, following two
such accomplished story tellers.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.970
The story that I want to tell though
is one of elegant simplicity.

00:00:29.168 --> 00:00:35.764
It was that, a title I
suggested to David Talbott

00:00:36.383 --> 00:00:41.421
when I looked at the picture
that was emerging from

00:00:41.446 --> 00:00:45.712
an understanding of gravity,
which I spoke about last year,

00:00:46.855 --> 00:00:55.898
and as I worked on it I understood that
the universe really is much simpler

00:00:56.057 --> 00:01:00.818
then anyone could
have considered.

00:01:01.088 --> 00:01:06.718
But then, at the same time, there was
something that occurred in Canada,

00:01:07.202 --> 00:01:12.203
a presentation which I
watched with dismay,

00:01:12.228 --> 00:01:15.926
called the elegance or the
simplicity of everything.

00:01:18.014 --> 00:01:20.297
I'll see if I can get this to..

00:01:20.322 --> 00:01:22.945
it says the connection is lost..

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.944
Here we go.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.018
So The Elegant Simplicity
of the Electric Universe.

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:38.192
How come so many clever
people can't see it?

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.905
Only in the last few months
that I've found out why.

00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:45.878
It's an understanding that's
important for everyone,

00:01:45.903 --> 00:01:48.608
including all of you here.

00:01:49.656 --> 00:01:53.169
Today specialization is
the enemy of science.

00:01:53.636 --> 00:01:56.753
It produces more complication
than simplification

00:01:56.778 --> 00:01:59.729
because experts mislead
each other with things,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.482
as Tom said: "they don't
know they don't know."

00:02:03.808 --> 00:02:07.779
The result is a useless
reflection in a shattered mirror.

00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:14.207
So, who am I to be speaking to you about
the elegant simplicity of the universe?

00:02:14.762 --> 00:02:18.792
Looking back I can see how
I got into this position,

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.469
how I became a boundary
writer of science,

00:02:22.494 --> 00:02:27.211
as the science editor of the Canberra
Times dubbed me some years ago.

00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:32.553
From the earliest age I was
curious about how things worked,

00:02:32.578 --> 00:02:37.597
or read books and investigated
things on my own.

00:02:38.105 --> 00:02:42.758
Other kids did the same so I didn't
consider myself exceptionally clever.

00:02:43.377 --> 00:02:47.850
Looking back, it seems the event
that separated me from my peers

00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:53.512
was being inspired by an extraordinary
story of planetary chaos

00:02:53.537 --> 00:02:57.725
by Immanuel Velikovsky and his
book "Worlds in Collision".

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.593
This happened while I
was in high school.

00:03:01.545 --> 00:03:05.722
So, I began to question many of
the things I was being taught

00:03:05.747 --> 00:03:10.480
and when I got to university I think
I was the only physics undergrad

00:03:10.505 --> 00:03:14.143
who used to haunt the Anthropology
shelves at the library,

00:03:14.485 --> 00:03:20.817
checking to see whether Velikovsky
had cherry-picked his sources

00:03:21.285 --> 00:03:25.069
or whether he had made a
real case to be answered.

00:03:25.094 --> 00:03:30.310
And I came to the conclusion that he had
made a very good case to be answered.

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:34.899
So what had Velikovsky done?

00:03:34.924 --> 00:03:37.565
He'd thrown down a gauntlet
to astronomers that

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.363
they rejected by having his
best-selling book burned.

00:03:41.863 --> 00:03:45.696
So, book burning didn't
finish centuries ago.

00:03:45.721 --> 00:03:48.060
It happened last century.

00:03:49.965 --> 00:03:52.343
Velikovsky's heresy
was to publish that

00:03:52.368 --> 00:03:55.937
electromagnetism played a dominant
role in the solar system,

00:03:55.962 --> 00:03:59.855
particularly during periods
of planetary chaos.

00:04:01.386 --> 00:04:06.490
Many years later and shortly
before Velikovsky's passing,

00:04:06.522 --> 00:04:10.674
I visited him at his home in
Princeton and discussed this issue

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.170
about the electrical
nature of gravity

00:04:13.195 --> 00:04:17.289
because this was perhaps the
single most important thing

00:04:17.314 --> 00:04:20.150
that the astronomers
threw at him.

00:04:20.175 --> 00:04:23.802
That his mechanism
disobeyed Newton's laws.

00:04:24.343 --> 00:04:27.415
Once again this is the certainty
that there's only this law,

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.161
there's no "what if?" There is some
other aspect to the mechanism?

00:04:34.653 --> 00:04:40.471
So, it has taken me all of the intervening
years since then, there's quite a few,

00:04:40.496 --> 00:04:44.232
to overcome the education
I received as a student,

00:04:44.257 --> 00:04:48.433
to find the few true
pioneers of science

00:04:49.203 --> 00:04:56.583
and to relate this to
everyday experience.

00:04:57.432 --> 00:05:01.587
I firmly believe that the
Electric Universe is simple

00:05:02.642 --> 00:05:05.812
and you could begin to teach
it in primary school.

00:05:08.225 --> 00:05:12.548
It's an amazing and engrossing
story which fires the imagination

00:05:12.573 --> 00:05:16.166
and the explanations relate
to everyday experience.

00:05:16.552 --> 00:05:20.100
The Electric Universe is a cultural,
as well as a scientific, revolution

00:05:20.125 --> 00:05:23.443
that has been
millennia in coming.

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:27.167
It allows us to understand,
for the first time,

00:05:27.168 --> 00:05:29.392
the obsessive fear of
the planetary gods

00:05:29.417 --> 00:05:32.673
and their doomsday weapon,
the mighty Thunderbolt.

00:05:32.848 --> 00:05:38.043
The phenomenal thunderbolt of the planetary
gods is the link between our human story

00:05:38.068 --> 00:05:41.114
and the science of the
electric universe.

00:05:41.365 --> 00:05:45.008
Some of the renowned scientists of the
past like Newton and Faraday,

00:05:45.033 --> 00:05:48.660
predicted that electricity is the
secret to understanding gravity

00:05:48.685 --> 00:05:50.811
and therefore the universe.

00:05:50.937 --> 00:05:54.834
But in the early 20th century,
following the madness of World War,

00:05:54.859 --> 00:06:00.485
we reverted to the ancient geometric
religious mysticism of Pythagoras and Plato.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.199
In fact mathematicians were
formerly called geometers.

00:06:04.707 --> 00:06:10.213
And wartime established a fire hose of government
funding of science that hasn't ceased.

00:06:10.238 --> 00:06:12.839
It has had the
unintended consequences

00:06:12.864 --> 00:06:16.400
of paralyzing progress within
huge bureaucratic institutions

00:06:16.425 --> 00:06:20.132
and fostering censorship in the
form of anonymous peer review

00:06:20.157 --> 00:06:23.607
which stalls even
minor advances.

00:06:23.632 --> 00:06:29.579
Paradigm shifts come from individuals and
are resisted vigorously by authorities.

00:06:30.198 --> 00:06:35.176
The wartime command to large groups of
scientists to shut up and calculate

00:06:35.201 --> 00:06:39.816
has become, with the advent of
computers, shut up and simulate!

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:45.732
Simulations' pretty pictures are routinely
used to persuade non-expert audiences.

00:06:45.757 --> 00:06:48.011
Science is now in show business

00:06:48.036 --> 00:06:52.345
producing CGI virtual reality
entertainment on big screens.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.153
But computer models can only
reflect back what you put in.

00:06:56.178 --> 00:07:01.551
As a scientist, one must attend
to what lies beyond any model.

00:07:03.162 --> 00:07:08.638
Here is M74, a perfect example
of elegant simplicity.

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:11.617
It's called the perfect
spiral galaxy.

00:07:12.109 --> 00:07:16.262
Cosmologists can't explain
its formation or rotation

00:07:16.287 --> 00:07:20.981
without inventing weird stuff like
dark matter and a central black hole.

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:25.668
But adding arbitrary patches to a model
to make it work on a computer screen

00:07:25.693 --> 00:07:28.860
is not simplifying and it's
certainly not elegant.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.349
It's generally a sign that your model
is incomplete or just plain wrong.

00:07:34.691 --> 00:07:40.732
You'll notice on the picture
the strings of red spots in M74.

00:07:40.757 --> 00:07:44.675
They are star birth regions that
are brought out in this image.

00:07:45.095 --> 00:07:49.873
I'll discuss this later because
they confirm the Electric Universe.

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:57.102
The definition of elegance for a scientific
theory or solution to a problem is

00:07:57.127 --> 00:08:01.237
well-designed, pleasingly
ingenious and simple.

00:08:01.262 --> 00:08:04.841
Symmetry and balance are
also often important.

00:08:05.627 --> 00:08:09.842
But assessments of ingenuity
and simplicity are subjective,

00:08:09.867 --> 00:08:13.402
like an individual's
response to modern art.

00:08:14.378 --> 00:08:16.091
Paul Gauguin wrote:

00:08:16.116 --> 00:08:20.947
"The history of modern art is also the history
of the progressive loss of art's audience.

00:08:20.972 --> 00:08:26.953
Art has increasingly become the concern of the
artist and the bafflement of the public."

00:08:28.532 --> 00:08:30.792
So where are the art
critics of modern science

00:08:30.817 --> 00:08:34.140
when presented with a chalkboard
covered in mathematical symbols,

00:08:34.165 --> 00:08:37.628
most of which are undefined
in any real sense?

00:08:38.562 --> 00:08:40.898
Critics of this art
of branded deniers,

00:08:40.899 --> 00:08:44.267
as if consensus constitutes
a religious truth.

00:08:44.553 --> 00:08:47.208
Only a belief can be denied

00:08:47.233 --> 00:08:50.324
and if it's a consensus
belief it ain't science

00:08:50.349 --> 00:08:53.959
as Michael Crichton said in
one of these famous speeches.

00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:58.846
The late astronomer Halton Arp lamented
that investigative journalism,

00:08:58.871 --> 00:09:03.112
or in other words art
criticism, in science is dead.

00:09:03.541 --> 00:09:06.984
The Big Bang is the antithesis
of elegance and simplicity

00:09:07.009 --> 00:09:12.975
with its random explosions and collisions and
its multiplicity of forces and particles.

00:09:15.222 --> 00:09:18.348
Despite this, he is an
authority who said publicly

00:09:18.373 --> 00:09:21.905
that everything is not just
simple but astonishingly simple.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:27.109
Neil Turok, director of the Perimeter Institute
for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada

00:09:27.134 --> 00:09:30.450
speaking on October the
seventh last year..

00:09:31.617 --> 00:09:34.418
The astonishing
simplicity of everything,

00:09:34.443 --> 00:09:37.502
but that implies you
know everything.

00:09:39.708 --> 00:09:42.720
But I will show you that there
are many very basic things

00:09:42.745 --> 00:09:46.037
that experts don't
know they don't know.

00:09:50.323 --> 00:09:53.062
Neil Turok defined simplicity:

00:09:53.087 --> 00:09:56.092
"Simplicity means
concepts which unify.

00:09:56.117 --> 00:09:59.792
They bring together disparate
ideas, disparate knowledge,

00:09:59.817 --> 00:10:02.316
make sense of them
and simplify."

00:10:02.341 --> 00:10:04.056
I agree.

00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:07.278
But adding fudge factors like
dark matter and dark energy

00:10:07.303 --> 00:10:10.015
is the antithesis of simplicity.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.110
What other disparate
knowledge was canvassed?

00:10:13.135 --> 00:10:15.654
Certainly not Halton Arp's
observational research

00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:18.717
that shows the universe
is not expanding.

00:10:18.742 --> 00:10:21.571
Certainly not peer-reviewed
plasma cosmology

00:10:21.596 --> 00:10:25.750
that explains it simply and
predicts so much in cosmology.

00:10:29.877 --> 00:10:34.729
Simple concepts are those that
explain as much as we possibly can

00:10:34.754 --> 00:10:37.305
with the least possible
number of assumptions.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.482
And I agree, that's a good test.

00:10:39.507 --> 00:10:44.078
The problem is how little theoretical
physics actually explains.

00:10:44.103 --> 00:10:49.224
Quantum physics has no explanation,
gravity has no explanation

00:10:49.249 --> 00:10:51.384
and the two are incompatible.

00:10:51.409 --> 00:10:56.199
Theoretical physics, as it
stands today, is very limited.

00:10:56.224 --> 00:10:59.872
But as British astrophysicist
Mike Disney shows,

00:10:59.897 --> 00:11:05.095
the number of free parameters (assumptions)
in the Big Bang exceeds the measurements.

00:11:05.738 --> 00:11:10.738
So consensus Big Bang cosmology fails
this test at the starting gate.

00:11:10.763 --> 00:11:15.561
A recent massive supercomputer simulation
produced the universe of galaxies

00:11:15.586 --> 00:11:18.307
that seems to match
observations.

00:11:18.332 --> 00:11:21.277
Despite using concepts
that are invalid.

00:11:21.963 --> 00:11:25.119
So what good are
computer simulations?

00:11:25.396 --> 00:11:30.299
With all the free parameters it could
have produced a platypus or koala bear.

00:11:30.324 --> 00:11:35.502
Nevertheless, simulations are offered
as experiments and proof of theories.

00:11:38.916 --> 00:11:41.970
After describing the
Big Bang, Turok said:

00:11:41.995 --> 00:11:45.192
"The universe has turned out
to be stunningly simple.

00:11:45.217 --> 00:11:48.398
It's simpler than any of
our models can explain."

00:11:48.985 --> 00:11:52.372
But hang on a minute, if none of the
models can explain the simplicity,

00:11:52.397 --> 00:11:54.818
surely all of the
models have failed.

00:11:57.818 --> 00:12:02.604
Now, here's the astonishingly simple
equation of all known physics.

00:12:03.104 --> 00:12:06.800
I would ask, where is life and
consciousness in that equation?

00:12:07.475 --> 00:12:11.819
You'll notice that Peter Higgs gets a
mention, the second from the right.

00:12:11.844 --> 00:12:14.936
Turok said: "They've
found the Higgs boson"!

00:12:14.961 --> 00:12:16.212
No, they didn’t!

00:12:16.237 --> 00:12:18.410
If the Higgs mechanism
explains masses

00:12:18.435 --> 00:12:22.187
it should be able to calculate the mass
ratio of the proton to the electron.

00:12:22.212 --> 00:12:23.331
It can't.

00:12:23.356 --> 00:12:26.193
And who in this audience
thinks that's simple?

00:12:27.709 --> 00:12:30.942
That it allows them to
understand everything.

00:12:34.736 --> 00:12:37.886
But here we come to an
important qualifier.

00:12:40.164 --> 00:12:45.602
"The grand unified theory is compact
and elegant in mathematical terms."

00:12:46.896 --> 00:12:51.371
Turok then launches into numbers,
Pythagoras' theorem, imaginary numbers,

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:53.640
allowing the solution
of any equation

00:12:53.665 --> 00:12:58.393
and an enthusiastic endorsement of
mathematics for the rest of the lecture.

00:12:58.418 --> 00:13:01.405
But unless each symbol and
operator can be defined..

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:02.148
pardon me,

00:13:02.149 --> 00:13:07.143
defined in real physical terms, an
equation is physically meaningless.

00:13:10.296 --> 00:13:15.320
Mismatches with theory cause the invention
of ever more particles and forces.

00:13:15.345 --> 00:13:19.193
Which violates the claim of
simplicity and elegance.

00:13:22.173 --> 00:13:28.038
In fact, mathematics is an art often
applied unscientifically to science.

00:13:28.309 --> 00:13:31.003
Unless you have all of the
correct physical concepts

00:13:31.028 --> 00:13:33.397
and definitions in your
mathematical model,

00:13:33.431 --> 00:13:36.572
the conclusions cannot
be relied upon.

00:13:36.597 --> 00:13:39.580
The art becomes surreal.

00:13:39.904 --> 00:13:43.621
The genius Johann Wolfgang
Von Goethe wrote:

00:13:43.646 --> 00:13:49.472
"Mathematics has the completely false
reputation of yielding infallible conclusions."

00:13:51.226 --> 00:13:56.460
So we come to art and surrealism
and the celebrity, Kip Thorne,

00:13:56.485 --> 00:14:00.411
Feynman emeritus professor of
theoretical physics in Caltech

00:14:00.436 --> 00:14:03.111
who has this to say
about simplicity:

00:14:03.136 --> 00:14:07.472
"Simplicity is the touchstone
in finding new physical laws...

00:14:07.497 --> 00:14:12.500
if it's elegant, then it's a rough rule
of thumb: you're on the right track."

00:14:13.654 --> 00:14:18.105
Thorne was the executive producer
of the sci-fi film Interstellar.

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:22.173
The film blurb says: "His
math guided the creation of

00:14:22.198 --> 00:14:25.482
the mesmerizing and the most
accurate simulation ever

00:14:25.507 --> 00:14:27.954
of what a black hole
would look like.

00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:34.240
And it was the product of the year of work
by 30 people and thousands of computers."

00:14:37.029 --> 00:14:40.618
Kip Thorne said: "I think the thing
that makes this film different

00:14:40.643 --> 00:14:44.804
is that the science is woven into this film
and into the story from the beginning.

00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:47.460
And woven in deeply.

00:14:48.497 --> 00:14:51.706
Real science."

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:56.791
Quite the reverse is true, cosmology has
become science fiction entertainment.

00:14:56.816 --> 00:14:59.638
There's nothing scientific
about the slide on the right

00:14:59.663 --> 00:15:03.986
from Thorne's Wolfgang Pauli
lecture in Zurich in 2011,

00:15:04.011 --> 00:15:09.096
"A black hole is made from warped
space . . . and space and time."

00:15:09.121 --> 00:15:11.517
But as Steve Crothers has
shown, black hole theory

00:15:11.542 --> 00:15:14.628
makes no sense mathematically,
let alone physically.

00:15:14.653 --> 00:15:20.713
How do you make a material object out of
two immaterial concepts, space and time?

00:15:22.919 --> 00:15:26.474
As science teacher [Evan Camp]

00:15:26.499 --> 00:15:31.913
Evan Camp's student asked: "How can
smart people believe this stuff?"

00:15:32.881 --> 00:15:35.967
Recently I found the answer

00:15:35.992 --> 00:15:41.261
and it shows that our education systems
damage our ability to do science.

00:15:45.585 --> 00:15:51.680
The first thing to do, I think Tom touched
on this, is to first know yourself.

00:15:52.236 --> 00:15:54.774
The distinguished
doctor Iain McGilchrist

00:15:54.799 --> 00:15:59.226
is a psychiatrist, doctor, writer,
former Oxford literary scholar

00:15:59.251 --> 00:16:01.864
who wrote: The Master
and his Emissary,

00:16:01.889 --> 00:16:06.798
subtitled: The Divided Brain and
the Making of the Western World.

00:16:07.235 --> 00:16:11.478
His shorter e-book is: The Divided
Brain and the Search for Meaning,

00:16:11.503 --> 00:16:13.719
which I recommend to you.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.843
There are also some
excellent Youtube videos,

00:16:16.868 --> 00:16:21.423
interviews with him and
also an RSA animation

00:16:21.615 --> 00:16:24.796
from which I will
have a few images.

00:16:28.149 --> 00:16:34.062
He points out: The brain is profoundly divided
and this organ is profoundly asymmetric.

00:16:34.718 --> 00:16:36.203
And he asked the question:

00:16:36.228 --> 00:16:41.552
Why would nature divide brains if
there wasn't some use for that?

00:16:44.599 --> 00:16:47.138
He said: It's not true
that one part of the brain

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:52.119
does reason and the other does emotion.
Both are profoundly involved.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:58.036
It seems the main function
of the corpus callosum

00:16:58.061 --> 00:17:02.969
that join, joining fibres between
the left and right hemispheres,

00:17:02.994 --> 00:17:06.057
is to inhibit the
other hemisphere.

00:17:06.754 --> 00:17:09.577
Something very important
is going on here.

00:17:11.706 --> 00:17:16.032
The right hemisphere reacts faster
but inhibits less strongly.

00:17:17.788 --> 00:17:21.391
I should point out too that
physically they are different.

00:17:21.764 --> 00:17:24.664
One hemisphere is slightly
smaller than the other

00:17:24.689 --> 00:17:27.287
and the left hemisphere
is slightly rotated

00:17:27.312 --> 00:17:33.409
and the surface convolutions
are different..

00:17:33.434 --> 00:17:37.362
And even the chemical signaling
is different on both sides

00:17:37.387 --> 00:17:40.783
so they have a different
job to perform.

00:17:44.007 --> 00:17:47.409
This is a slide from
the RSA academies,

00:17:47.434 --> 00:17:50.439
the Royal Society of Arts
academies in the UK.

00:17:50.464 --> 00:17:54.717
I presume you've probably
all seen the animated

00:17:54.742 --> 00:17:58.297
swift drawing while
somebody is lecturing.

00:17:58.322 --> 00:18:02.929
This is from the YouTube video that
I recommend you to have a look at.

00:18:05.413 --> 00:18:12.744
In this he shows that the left hemisphere
is narrowly focused and attends to detail

00:18:12.769 --> 00:18:17.928
while the right hemisphere
is more broadly focused,

00:18:17.929 --> 00:18:22.004
it's alert and open to
what's going on around.

00:18:22.029 --> 00:18:25.087
And he gives an example
of the chicken.

00:18:25.112 --> 00:18:31.869
He said: the left hemisphere in the chicken
is looking for the seeds amongst the dirt,

00:18:31.894 --> 00:18:37.297
the right hemisphere is making sure the
chicken doesn't become somebody else's lunch.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.614
And I think that's a
good way to look at it.

00:18:41.639 --> 00:18:46.917
In other words the left hemisphere is survival,
the right hemisphere is a broad picture

00:18:46.942 --> 00:18:48.875
of what’s going on around you.

00:18:52.375 --> 00:18:58.587
I wrote to Iain McGilchrist and I sent him
a copy of the paper, PDF of the paper

00:18:58.612 --> 00:19:02.794
which had actually studied the left and
right hemisphere and image the activity

00:19:02.819 --> 00:19:06.612
that goes on when you ask physics
questions, of a student.

00:19:06.637 --> 00:19:10.319
And you'll notice that the left hemisphere
lights up like a Christmas tree

00:19:10.344 --> 00:19:13.171
and the right hemisphere
is rather passive.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:18.567
The different colors just referred to different
characteristics of what's being asked.

00:19:18.592 --> 00:19:24.448
Algebraic equation representation
is red, the green is periodicity,

00:19:24.473 --> 00:19:26.479
energy flow is blue.

00:19:30.424 --> 00:19:34.164
This brings me to: we've all
heard of cognitive dissonance,

00:19:34.189 --> 00:19:38.175
as if you're presented with something
that you just cannot handle,

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.113
it just doesn't make
any sense to you.

00:19:41.138 --> 00:19:45.428
And it seems that it's a
result of the differences

00:19:45.453 --> 00:19:47.999
between the two
hemispheres of the brain.

00:19:48.482 --> 00:19:54.078
The left hemisphere, as I said, has narrow
focus, only sees what it expects to see

00:19:54.103 --> 00:19:57.071
and has automatic
machine-like responses.

00:19:57.096 --> 00:19:59.044
It's about survival.

00:20:00.012 --> 00:20:05.025
Education in science reinforces the
bits rather than the whole picture.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.595
So the left hemisphere is
involved in the training.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:13.587
It's a vicious cycle because it
focuses on aspects we expect to see.

00:20:14.913 --> 00:20:17.739
You get stuck in a
certain way of thinking.

00:20:17.764 --> 00:20:21.017
Also the left hemisphere
needs to be in control.

00:20:22.744 --> 00:20:24.895
And the left hemisphere people,

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:31.650
that's those who have dominant
left hemisphere, exhibit denial.

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:37.511
We can all think of many
examples of this, I think,

00:20:37.536 --> 00:20:41.553
Michael Shermer's visit to our
last meeting as an example.

00:20:43.999 --> 00:20:49.091
The right hemisphere: meaning comes
from understanding the whole.

00:20:49.116 --> 00:20:51.999
In other words, it's trying
to take in the whole picture.

00:20:52.024 --> 00:20:56.859
And being comfortable, and this is important,
with not being able to grasp everything.

00:20:56.884 --> 00:21:00.492
You don't need to understand
the creation of the universe.

00:21:03.786 --> 00:21:05.493
What's more, he said,

00:21:05.518 --> 00:21:10.407
happiness comes from understanding your
connectedness and engagement with the world.

00:21:10.432 --> 00:21:12.011
I would say the universe

00:21:12.036 --> 00:21:15.657
because that's what the Electric
Universe is about, connectedness.

00:21:16.514 --> 00:21:22.837
Left hemisphere, Big Bang cosmology is
consequently, I would say, hope-less.

00:21:24.988 --> 00:21:28.536
McGilchrist's e-book is subtitled:
"Why are we so Unhappy?"

00:21:28.561 --> 00:21:31.852
And this is an, this is the whole
thing about the Electric Universe,

00:21:31.853 --> 00:21:36.409
there is no subject that it shouldn't
touch on if it is a real cosmology.

00:21:37.275 --> 00:21:41.315
He says, happiness comes
from social connectedness

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.608
and a sense of purpose
beyond the immediate.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.446
I would say that seems to
characterize our conferences.

00:21:48.668 --> 00:21:51.748
There is a great
sense of purpose.

00:21:53.018 --> 00:21:56.045
Modern goal-oriented
education, on the other hand,

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:58.465
and its constant audit
and inquisition,

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:02.232
turns off the intellectually
adventurous teachers and students.

00:22:02.257 --> 00:22:06.597
We don't understand the world by
putting it together bit by bit.

00:22:06.622 --> 00:22:08.667
Quite the opposite, in fact.

00:22:12.445 --> 00:22:14.619
So, Left Hemisphere Training

00:22:14.644 --> 00:22:19.214
The knowledge that is mediated by the left
hemisphere is within a closed system.

00:22:20.127 --> 00:22:23.448
This is typical of the scientific
approach of course, you isolate

00:22:23.473 --> 00:22:26.689
the small part of something and
then try and analyze that.

00:22:26.983 --> 00:22:29.538
It has the advantage
of appearing perfect

00:22:29.563 --> 00:22:33.568
but the perfection is bought
ultimately at the price of emptiness.

00:22:37.783 --> 00:22:41.484
So you see, the Big Bang
is a closed system.

00:22:41.509 --> 00:22:46.643
The universe expanded from a non-physical
point thirteen and a half billion years ago

00:22:46.668 --> 00:22:49.349
and increasing entropy
and disorder is expected

00:22:49.374 --> 00:22:51.381
but we see increasing order.

00:22:51.406 --> 00:22:54.273
The universe is not
a closed system!

00:22:55.576 --> 00:22:57.910
Geology is a closed system.

00:22:57.935 --> 00:23:01.765
So geologists could simply
extrapolate things seen today

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:06.075
back a few billion years and
make up any story they fancied.

00:23:07.686 --> 00:23:09.949
Biology is a closed system.

00:23:10.235 --> 00:23:12.856
Each organism is self-contained.

00:23:12.881 --> 00:23:15.767
Brain circuitry will
explain consciousness.

00:23:16.243 --> 00:23:18.850
Sheldrake and others
show this is invalid.

00:23:18.875 --> 00:23:21.939
The closed mechanical
model is wrong!

00:23:22.431 --> 00:23:25.198
Einstein's inertial frames
are closed systems.

00:23:25.223 --> 00:23:27.968
They have lost all
external references.

00:23:28.365 --> 00:23:31.520
You gotta ask, the speed
of light, you know,

00:23:31.545 --> 00:23:34.458
inertial reference frame
with respect to what?

00:23:34.483 --> 00:23:37.030
Some arbitrary observer.

00:23:41.459 --> 00:23:44.734
So modern science is
empty of real meaning.

00:23:44.759 --> 00:23:48.337
Left hemisphere dominance
is the safeway.

00:23:48.362 --> 00:23:51.980
A way that minimizes risk and
provides a way forward that seemingly

00:23:52.005 --> 00:23:56.028
is a more secure and logical
approach to decision making.

00:23:56.303 --> 00:23:59.528
The Machine metaphor reduces
things to isolated bits

00:23:59.553 --> 00:24:02.084
and loses sight of
the connected whole.

00:24:02.109 --> 00:24:07.222
Stars are isolated objects,
galaxies are isolated objects,

00:24:07.247 --> 00:24:09.887
we are isolated individuals.

00:24:09.912 --> 00:24:13.163
It's chickens, picking
at seeds in the dirt.

00:24:16.507 --> 00:24:22.085
Of course, when you're tied
up with this narrow view

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:25.308
you end up with a whole
of mirrors effect.

00:24:25.866 --> 00:24:27.731
The more we get
trapped into this,

00:24:27.756 --> 00:24:31.143
the more we undercut the things
that might have led us out of it

00:24:31.168 --> 00:24:34.222
and we just get reflected back
into more of what we know,

00:24:34.247 --> 00:24:37.962
about what we know, about what
we know, about what we know...

00:24:37.987 --> 00:24:42.526
So the greatest problem becomes the
things we don't know we don't know.

00:24:44.986 --> 00:24:48.194
More information, we
have it in spades

00:24:48.219 --> 00:24:50.455
but we get less and
less able to use it,

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.979
to understand it, to be wise.

00:24:53.004 --> 00:24:55.358
These are Iain
McGilchrist's words.

00:24:55.773 --> 00:24:59.611
Instead we go searching in the
crap for signals we expect to see.

00:24:59.636 --> 00:25:01.933
That's my words.

00:25:07.178 --> 00:25:09.709
"There's a paradoxical
relationship",

00:25:10.058 --> 00:25:12.620
Iain says, "as I know
as a psychiatrist,

00:25:12.645 --> 00:25:16.217
between the knowledge of the parts
and wisdom about the whole.

00:25:16.242 --> 00:25:19.938
It's the machine model that is
supposed to answer everything

00:25:19.963 --> 00:25:21.348
but it doesn't."

00:25:21.349 --> 00:25:23.898
In other words the
theory of everything.

00:25:27.684 --> 00:25:30.675
This is a perfect example
of a hall of mirrors.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.889
This is the large hadron
collider control room.

00:25:34.367 --> 00:25:40.182
Experiments are done on computer
screens, it's virtual research.

00:25:40.207 --> 00:25:44.678
In our computerized world the virtual
makes something seem more real.

00:25:45.583 --> 00:25:48.912
As one scientist said,
sexy images sell!

00:25:49.794 --> 00:25:52.096
We see that all the
time in the media.

00:25:52.121 --> 00:25:56.347
The picture, however, has become
fragmented and surreal science fiction.

00:25:56.372 --> 00:25:59.347
Mistakes no longer mean going
back to the drawing board,

00:25:59.372 --> 00:26:02.165
mistakes now need
to be de-bugged.

00:26:04.291 --> 00:26:08.383
It creates a classic hall of
mirrors reflecting a single model.

00:26:09.583 --> 00:26:14.032
Signals buried in noise become
statistical discoveries and proof.

00:26:14.057 --> 00:26:18.747
The computers are programmed to find, deep
in the noise, what they expect to see.

00:26:18.772 --> 00:26:20.446
I think the,

00:26:20.471 --> 00:26:24.508
the LIGO and the gravitational wave
experiment is a prime example.

00:26:24.949 --> 00:26:28.494
Images on a screen become
real discoveries or proof,

00:26:28.519 --> 00:26:31.605
the Higgs boson,
gravitational waves.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:35.302
It illustrates group-think and
left hemisphere dominance,

00:26:35.327 --> 00:26:37.857
a blindness to alternatives.

00:26:37.858 --> 00:26:39.706
...Sorry...

00:26:41.301 --> 00:26:44.708
But paradigm shifts come from
individuals using their mind,

00:26:44.733 --> 00:26:47.193
not large teams using computers,

00:26:48.312 --> 00:26:50.762
the ultimate black boxes.

00:26:51.859 --> 00:26:55.721
They invent new forces and particles
to reclaim control of the model.

00:26:55.746 --> 00:26:59.189
The quark, the gluon,
dark energy, dark matter.

00:26:59.982 --> 00:27:02.395
So big science is failing.

00:27:02.593 --> 00:27:05.908
There have been no fundamental
advances for a century.

00:27:05.909 --> 00:27:08.680
It's accepted that the
basis of what we now...

00:27:08.705 --> 00:27:11.223
what is now known is
more or less correct.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:15.890
A Copernican revolution is totally
unthinkable within the current system.

00:27:16.292 --> 00:27:18.459
There are not many
differences between

00:27:18.484 --> 00:27:22.453
the modern academy and the universities
in the 16th and 17th century

00:27:22.478 --> 00:27:26.256
which conformed to the church
and to Aristotle's text.

00:27:26.541 --> 00:27:28.047
The symptoms?

00:27:28.072 --> 00:27:30.251
Science is non-predictive.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.220
There are continual surprises.

00:27:33.245 --> 00:27:36.208
Counter arguments are
ignored or unpublished

00:27:36.209 --> 00:27:40.925
and the history of science is sanitized
to give the impression of progress.

00:27:52.547 --> 00:27:54.978
What's the remedy?

00:27:56.827 --> 00:28:00.253
Evan Camp is a teacher, an
8th grade science teacher

00:28:00.278 --> 00:28:03.253
who ran an Electric Universe
group after school.

00:28:03.278 --> 00:28:06.870
He presented an outstanding
talk at EU 2013,

00:28:06.895 --> 00:28:10.045
Exciting Students with
Unsettled Science.

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:14.020
It's available on the
Thunderbolts.info YouTube channel.

00:28:14.823 --> 00:28:20.410
He said: "Every mile you go in the wrong
direction is really a two-mile error.

00:28:20.435 --> 00:28:23.958
Unlearning is twice
as hard as learning."

00:28:23.983 --> 00:28:28.713
In fact it's much harder than that because
at the end of the first mile you are lost.

00:28:28.738 --> 00:28:34.251
Because what you have learned
inhibits new learning

00:28:34.276 --> 00:28:36.275
and accelerates forgetting.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:40.036
This requires an active
remedial process.

00:28:40.901 --> 00:28:45.703
It requires a conceptual mediation
program as early as possible.

00:28:46.035 --> 00:28:47.879
Such a program has been tested

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.629
by Dr. Harry Lyndon in south
Australia, with encouraging results.

00:28:51.874 --> 00:28:56.278
He says, the primary goal of science
educators involves helping young people

00:28:56.279 --> 00:28:59.550
to acquire scientific knowledge
with greater facility.

00:28:59.575 --> 00:29:02.608
To achieve a deeper level of
understanding in their studies

00:29:02.633 --> 00:29:05.295
and for these understandings
to be lasting.

00:29:05.956 --> 00:29:08.137
It has been
established, however,

00:29:08.162 --> 00:29:10.469
that a universal
problem in schooling

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:14.985
concerns the fact that science learning
is evidently difficult for most students.

00:29:15.358 --> 00:29:17.564
A general conclusion that

00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:20.079
even students who are
successful in examinations

00:29:20.104 --> 00:29:24.033
are unable to retain and
apply scientific concepts.

00:29:24.506 --> 00:29:28.125
When students move into high school,
many experience disappointment

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:32.108
because the science they are taught
is neither relevant nor engaging

00:29:32.133 --> 00:29:35.688
and doesn't connect with their
interests and experiences.

00:29:36.396 --> 00:29:39.405
When new information or
ideas disagree or conflict

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:42.129
with what the left
hemisphere already knows,

00:29:42.154 --> 00:29:46.110
the left hemisphere inhibits
or denies the new information

00:29:46.135 --> 00:29:50.135
and causes accelerated forgetting
of the new knowledge or skill.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.637
It protects all prior knowledge.

00:29:52.662 --> 00:29:55.556
Old learning disables
new learning.

00:29:55.581 --> 00:29:59.583
According to Lyndon, it's
why old habits die hard.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:08.096
Old Way/New Way Learning where the old
and the new are repeatedly contrasted

00:30:08.121 --> 00:30:12.159
is a method developed by Dr.
Lyndon and a colleague

00:30:12.184 --> 00:30:14.794
and it's an innovative
teaching method.

00:30:16.326 --> 00:30:21.017
It's a system where the students
actively and repeatedly

00:30:21.042 --> 00:30:24.941
contrast the old and the new until
the inhibition is overcome.

00:30:24.966 --> 00:30:28.361
It forces the student to
think about thinking.

00:30:29.067 --> 00:30:31.307
This is important for
what is to follow.

00:30:31.332 --> 00:30:34.286
Because it will help those who
follow the Thunderbolts movement

00:30:34.311 --> 00:30:36.490
to understand the
problems others face

00:30:36.515 --> 00:30:39.295
when confronted with
a paradigm shift

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.809
of the magnitude of the
Electric Universe.

00:30:41.834 --> 00:30:46.225
And also some areas of
your own personal denial.

00:30:50.326 --> 00:30:56.287
So, cosmology must address the
infinitesimal as well as the infinite.

00:30:56.867 --> 00:30:59.077
So let's go to the
heart of the matter.

00:30:59.102 --> 00:31:03.933
Because, incredibly,
mass is undefined!

00:31:03.958 --> 00:31:06.242
In every textbook
and encyclopedia

00:31:06.267 --> 00:31:09.430
the amount of mass is confused
with the amount of matter.

00:31:09.455 --> 00:31:12.677
Perhaps because they both
begin with the letter 'M'.

00:31:13.122 --> 00:31:17.622
This means that no scientist
understands E=mc²

00:31:18.455 --> 00:31:21.015
This confusion allows
particle physicists

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:24.148
to talk of creation and
annihilation of matter

00:31:24.173 --> 00:31:27.661
which is impossible without
understanding what matter is.

00:31:27.955 --> 00:31:30.138
It's not physics.

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:32.806
E = mc² is simply
telling us that

00:31:32.831 --> 00:31:37.846
that mass is a measure of the
amount of energy held in matter.

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:42.790
Particles have no
mass, we're told.

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:46.283
And with this ignorance the
standard particle model says,

00:31:46.308 --> 00:31:49.887
subatomic particles have no
intrinsic mass which is nonsense.

00:31:49.912 --> 00:31:54.397
Are they saying protons and electrons
have no rest mass, no energy?

00:31:54.398 --> 00:31:56.241
It seems so.

00:31:56.687 --> 00:31:59.875
In the standard particle model
mass is provided externally

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:04.708
by a kind of cosmic trickle
of imaginary Higgs bosons.

00:32:05.194 --> 00:32:08.274
The total cost of finding
something dubbed the Higgs boson

00:32:08.299 --> 00:32:12.852
at the Large Hadron Collider ran over
13 billion dollars in July 2012,

00:32:12.877 --> 00:32:15.121
at the running cost of a
billion dollars a year.

00:32:15.146 --> 00:32:18.471
That makes it more than 17
billion years, billion dollars

00:32:18.496 --> 00:32:22.543
wasted, chasing the green
of the Cheshire cat.

00:32:22.568 --> 00:32:26.473
The LHC operates like smashing
countless jumbo jets in the mountains

00:32:26.498 --> 00:32:29.822
and picking over the debris
to see how they fly.

00:32:29.847 --> 00:32:33.641
But the whole is more than the
sum of the bits, we can see.

00:32:33.666 --> 00:32:37.061
We are not dealing
with closed systems.

00:32:38.815 --> 00:32:42.497
Even worse, it's like asking
one of Douglas Adams'

00:32:42.522 --> 00:32:45.589
telephone hygienists to
do the investigation.

00:32:45.614 --> 00:32:48.379
The investigators are
not properly trained.

00:32:51.407 --> 00:32:53.185
Energy is undefined.

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:56.993
What you will find in textbooks are
examples of different forms of energy.

00:32:57.018 --> 00:33:00.382
The Big Bang is supposed to have
originated from pure energy

00:33:00.407 --> 00:33:04.508
which is nonsense when energy only makes
sense in relation to matter in motion,

00:33:04.533 --> 00:33:06.833
with respect to
all other matter.

00:33:06.858 --> 00:33:10.191
But matter hasn't been defined
in any physical sense

00:33:10.216 --> 00:33:12.826
involving sensible
internal movement.

00:33:15.026 --> 00:33:16.997
The quantum realm is weird.

00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:21.187
It's admitted by leading physicists that
no one understands quantum mechanics.

00:33:21.212 --> 00:33:26.194
It's incompatible with Einstein's postulate
of no instantaneous information transfer

00:33:26.219 --> 00:33:29.164
and it seems to involve even
the experimenter's thoughts

00:33:29.189 --> 00:33:31.670
in the outcome of
some experiments.

00:33:31.893 --> 00:33:35.821
Once again, any experiment
is not a closed system

00:33:36.053 --> 00:33:38.380
as physicists like to assume.

00:33:38.405 --> 00:33:41.967
That is why the quantum
realm appears weird.

00:33:43.628 --> 00:33:48.652
Light and the electric force are mysteriously
transferred through empty space.

00:33:49.066 --> 00:33:52.255
We have all experienced the
force between two magnets.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.922
What's happening in the
space between them?

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:01.154
The pioneers of electromagnetism
knew there has to be a medium

00:34:01.179 --> 00:34:04.878
to transfer the electric force.
They called it the ether.

00:34:05.229 --> 00:34:10.836
The ether has to be an electrically
polarizable medium that fills the universe.

00:34:11.148 --> 00:34:14.967
In that way you can daisy-chain
the electric force directly.

00:34:14.992 --> 00:34:17.487
It's a longitudinal force.

00:34:17.961 --> 00:34:21.628
And applying the speed of light limit
to that makes no sense whatsoever

00:34:21.653 --> 00:34:24.499
because light is a wave motion.

00:34:25.548 --> 00:34:29.517
I think I've said before that's like the
difference between pulling on a rope

00:34:29.542 --> 00:34:32.214
and feeling the tug at the
other end almost instantly,

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:36.238
and waving one end of the rope and waiting
for the wave to get to the other end.

00:34:36.263 --> 00:34:39.890
Light is a slow process
in the universe.

00:34:41.635 --> 00:34:46.746
So if we have this ether that fills
the universe, space is full.

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:49.548
There's no such thing
as a perfect vacuum.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:55.158
Einstein knew there has to be an ether but
his postulates somehow did away with it.

00:34:55.183 --> 00:34:57.770
He admitted that his theory
of relativity would fail

00:34:57.795 --> 00:35:00.558
if the Earth's motion through
the ether were detected.

00:35:00.559 --> 00:35:04.286
That's because his inertial frames of
reference would not be equivalent.

00:35:04.311 --> 00:35:09.085
It would be like having one observer
experiencing a gentle breeze from the ether wind

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:12.437
while another might be
suffering a howling gale.

00:35:12.462 --> 00:35:16.638
As it turns out, Dayton Miller repeated
the Michelson-Morley ether experiments

00:35:16.639 --> 00:35:19.153
far more rigorously and
at different elevations.

00:35:19.178 --> 00:35:21.702
He found an ether drift.

00:35:21.727 --> 00:35:26.359
Sadly, left hemisphere training
denied and quickly forgot this fact.

00:35:29.628 --> 00:35:32.834
So let's have a look at the
standard particle model.

00:35:33.739 --> 00:35:37.253
An atom, once a promise of
fundamental simplicity,

00:35:37.278 --> 00:35:42.344
is really a nucleus within a hazy
probabilistic fog of electrons.

00:35:42.598 --> 00:35:45.618
The nucleus is some protons
and neutrons held together

00:35:45.643 --> 00:35:49.211
by the mysterious short range
nuclear or strong force.

00:35:49.236 --> 00:35:51.497
The particles in the
nucleus have a hidden,

00:35:51.522 --> 00:35:54.894
unknown number of weird
undetectable bits inside.

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:58.058
These bits are appearing
and disappearing

00:35:58.083 --> 00:36:02.090
in defiance of a principle of science
that miracles are forbidden.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:05.477
Meanwhile, a recent report
from the Large Hadron Collider

00:36:05.502 --> 00:36:08.684
suggests new findings that
don't fit this model.

00:36:09.977 --> 00:36:13.977
Here's a snapshot of a proton
by Professor Matthew Strassler.

00:36:14.002 --> 00:36:20.486
He writes: "...imagine all of the quarks
(up, down, and strange -- u, d, s),

00:36:20.487 --> 00:36:25.276
antiquarks (u, d, s with a
bar on top), and gluons (g),

00:36:25.301 --> 00:36:27.332
zipping around near
the speed of light,

00:36:27.357 --> 00:36:31.022
banging into each other, and
appearing and disappearing."

00:36:31.625 --> 00:36:35.245
So, a proton is said to be some
quarks held together by some gluons

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:39.911
which are themselves the quantized
manifestations of the strong force.

00:36:41.007 --> 00:36:45.041
There is no mention of how a
force manifests as a particle.

00:36:45.066 --> 00:36:46.677
It gets much worse.

00:36:46.702 --> 00:36:50.173
A gluon is really one of
several colors of gluon.

00:36:50.198 --> 00:36:54.206
But it also has the simultaneous
property of anti-color.

00:36:54.405 --> 00:36:57.319
Gluons mediate the
interaction between quarks

00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:01.059
but they also mediate the interaction
between themselves and quarks.

00:37:01.084 --> 00:37:03.439
That's right, gluons
are the strong force

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.869
but they also experience
the strong force.

00:37:07.639 --> 00:37:12.196
Happily for the physicists, quarks
are unobservable in principle

00:37:12.221 --> 00:37:15.188
because they only exist
inside the nucleon.

00:37:15.587 --> 00:37:18.004
It's very convenient..

00:37:20.203 --> 00:37:22.007
This is simple?

00:37:22.032 --> 00:37:23.791
You can forget elegance.

00:37:23.816 --> 00:37:27.450
This is extreme, narrow, left
hemisphere focus on a model

00:37:27.475 --> 00:37:31.434
with no basic definitions to make
sense of the words being used.

00:37:32.529 --> 00:37:35.388
Andrew Pickering, the author
of "Constructing Quarks",

00:37:35.413 --> 00:37:39.189
it is a sociological study
of particle physics

00:37:40.372 --> 00:37:44.283
and it's interesting book, says:
"There's no obligation on anyone

00:37:44.308 --> 00:37:47.506
to take account of what 20th
century science has to say.

00:37:47.531 --> 00:37:52.156
To listen too closely to scientists may
be simply to stifle the imagination,"

00:37:52.181 --> 00:37:53.937
that is the right hemisphere.

00:37:53.962 --> 00:37:58.826
"Worldviews are cultural products, there
is no need to be intimidated by them."

00:38:01.234 --> 00:38:04.995
We come to the Electric
Universe model of the atom.

00:38:05.567 --> 00:38:08.732
The electrically neutral atom
is made of charged particles,

00:38:08.757 --> 00:38:10.909
positive and negative
in equal numbers,

00:38:10.934 --> 00:38:14.214
together with a number of neutral
particles called neutrons.

00:38:14.239 --> 00:38:15.996
Stating the obvious.

00:38:17.125 --> 00:38:21.128
All subatomic particles are real
with real locations in space,

00:38:21.153 --> 00:38:23.477
it's not a probabilistic fog.

00:38:26.446 --> 00:38:31.544
There is a polarizable ether which transmits
force and carries electromagnetic waves.

00:38:31.959 --> 00:38:36.433
The universe is full of an electrically
neutral perfect fluid of neutral particles

00:38:36.458 --> 00:38:41.654
which passes through atoms and celestial
bodies practically as if they weren't there.

00:38:42.051 --> 00:38:44.859
Neutrinos fit this description.

00:38:45.772 --> 00:38:51.677
So, the Electric Universe then defines
what it means by energy and mass.

00:38:51.702 --> 00:38:57.499
Energy is matter in motion relative to
the matter in the rest of the universe.

00:38:58.801 --> 00:39:03.089
It used to be said, in
relation to the fixed stars.

00:39:04.073 --> 00:39:06.628
This is not a closed
system approach.

00:39:06.653 --> 00:39:11.810
It is a unifying relational concept
first articulated by Ernst Mach.

00:39:15.653 --> 00:39:17.751
So we define mass:

00:39:17.776 --> 00:39:21.880
Mass is a measure of particle
distortion instead of acceleration

00:39:21.905 --> 00:39:26.189
in response to the electric forces
from all other matter in the universe.

00:39:26.214 --> 00:39:28.983
It's a bit like pushing a
balloon full of water.

00:39:29.008 --> 00:39:32.206
It will tend to distort,
rather than move.

00:39:32.231 --> 00:39:38.399
And it's the same with these orbital systems
of electrons and protons and so on.

00:39:39.569 --> 00:39:43.456
Once again, this conforms
with Ernst Mach's principle.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.444
Neutrons may not exist
in the nucleus.

00:39:48.469 --> 00:39:53.382
If so, only two particles are necessary
to build all of the elements.

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:58.599
This idea came from Edwin Kaal
who I'm pleased to say is here

00:39:58.624 --> 00:40:01.438
and will be presenting
in the breakout room.

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:05.903
And the problem for physicists
is how do you hold together

00:40:05.928 --> 00:40:08.054
all of the positive
charges in the nucleus,

00:40:08.079 --> 00:40:11.331
they should repel one
another very powerfully.

00:40:11.881 --> 00:40:14.437
The repulsion of those
positive charged protons

00:40:14.462 --> 00:40:16.959
should prevent it from
forming in the first place.

00:40:16.984 --> 00:40:21.476
However, atomic nuclei seem to
require neutrons for stability.

00:40:21.934 --> 00:40:25.292
That's because when a
radioactive atom nucleus decays

00:40:25.317 --> 00:40:28.647
neutral particles are sometimes
observed to leave the nucleus

00:40:28.672 --> 00:40:30.605
and exist for a few minutes

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:33.954
before further decaying into
an electron and a proton.

00:40:34.533 --> 00:40:39.591
So it was assumed, such a neutral
particle pre-existed in the nucleus.

00:40:40.281 --> 00:40:42.985
The "what if" question
wasn't asked.

00:40:43.239 --> 00:40:45.549
That maybe that wasn't so.

00:40:45.779 --> 00:40:48.198
This is an assumption that
still does not explain

00:40:48.223 --> 00:40:50.866
how the positive nucleus
remains cohesive.

00:40:50.891 --> 00:40:54.896
So a special short-range strong
nuclear force was invented.

00:40:55.054 --> 00:40:58.404
The proliferation of
forces and particles.

00:40:59.404 --> 00:41:02.575
Edwin Kaal suggested
a simpler solution.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.522
If the electrons remain as
discrete particles in the nucleus,

00:41:05.547 --> 00:41:07.815
they will tend to
arrange themselves

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:11.014
to, on average, seat equidistant
between the protons;

00:41:11.039 --> 00:41:13.808
because the distance between
the protons is greater than

00:41:13.833 --> 00:41:16.338
that between each proton and
a neighboring electron,

00:41:16.363 --> 00:41:19.272
the attractive electric force
between the proton and electron,

00:41:19.297 --> 00:41:20.819
sorry if it's too fast,

00:41:20.844 --> 00:41:23.685
will be four times greater
than the repulsive force.

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:28.579
This simple hypothesis removes the need for
an extra strong force within the nucleus.

00:41:28.604 --> 00:41:30.658
It's much simpler.

00:41:30.683 --> 00:41:33.464
And then it seems that
neutrons are short-lived,

00:41:33.489 --> 00:41:37.360
metastable resonance of a closely
bound proton and electron.

00:41:38.257 --> 00:41:39.778
This is simple.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:49.615
The Electric Universe simply proposes
structure within structure, repeated pattern.

00:41:50.191 --> 00:41:53.880
To understand magnetism and gravity
we must go to the heart of matter

00:41:53.905 --> 00:41:57.044
a similar approach to that
of Andre Marie Ampere,

00:41:57.069 --> 00:42:00.496
Carl Friedrich Gauss, Wilhelm
Weber and Walther Ritz,

00:42:00.521 --> 00:42:05.303
who considered the behavior of positive and
negative charged particles of different mass

00:42:05.328 --> 00:42:08.614
with great success but were
ignored for political reasons.

00:42:08.639 --> 00:42:10.789
Chiefly, they weren't
English, I think.

00:42:13.933 --> 00:42:15.814
Here's a simple hypothesis.

00:42:15.839 --> 00:42:17.862
The electron and
proton have stable

00:42:17.887 --> 00:42:21.110
resonant orbital structures
of smaller charged particles.

00:42:22.085 --> 00:42:23.568
In that case,

00:42:23.822 --> 00:42:29.934
the positron, that is the antiparticles,
and anti proton are mirror particles.

00:42:29.959 --> 00:42:32.782
They're not antiparticles,
they're mirrors.

00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:36.928
There is no antimatter, no
creation or annihilation.

00:42:36.953 --> 00:42:39.268
But this requires that
there be an ether

00:42:39.293 --> 00:42:43.145
of composite neutral particles of
vanishingly small mass, the neutrinos.

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:47.650
Neutrinos must be quite complex
inside but totally collapsed

00:42:47.675 --> 00:42:53.719
so that they can accept energy and
then become a particle and its mirror.

00:42:53.744 --> 00:42:55.314
But there's nothing,

00:42:55.339 --> 00:42:58.786
it is just assumed that when these
particles seem to disappear,

00:42:58.811 --> 00:43:02.067
that they're annihilated,
the matter has disappeared.

00:43:02.289 --> 00:43:03.908
That's not so.

00:43:05.789 --> 00:43:09.345
So the ether must be nor matter
of vanishingly small mass

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:13.202
composed of all the sub particles needed
to split into an electron and a positron

00:43:13.227 --> 00:43:18.583
for example, when subjected to the
appropriate energy, electromagnetic energy.

00:43:19.621 --> 00:43:21.234
For stability,

00:43:21.259 --> 00:43:23.848
and this is one of the
stumbling blocks, of course,

00:43:23.873 --> 00:43:27.078
for particle physicists
to go this way,

00:43:27.522 --> 00:43:32.025
is that the electric
force must act

00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:34.949
between the tiny particles
within the atom instantly.

00:43:34.974 --> 00:43:36.712
No speed of light delay.

00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:41.916
The two stable particles --
the electron and the proton,

00:43:41.941 --> 00:43:46.788
if we assume the neutron is
just a metastable particle,

00:43:47.249 --> 00:43:53.329
form 254 stable nuclides
plus another 85 metastable,

00:43:53.354 --> 00:43:56.825
that is radioactive nuclides,
for a total of 339.

00:43:56.850 --> 00:44:02.401
So from this simple resonant systems
of structure within structure

00:44:02.426 --> 00:44:05.455
we have all of the
materials we need to see,

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:10.040
to make what we see in
the world around us.

00:44:11.734 --> 00:44:15.578
When those nuclei combine with the
requisite number of negative electrons

00:44:15.579 --> 00:44:19.297
to form atoms and molecules, the
possibilities are boundless

00:44:19.322 --> 00:44:21.043
in the living world.

00:44:23.399 --> 00:44:25.427
What does this mean?

00:44:25.596 --> 00:44:31.291
Only a single force is necessary, the
powerful instantaneous electric force.

00:44:31.316 --> 00:44:34.547
The phenomenal strength of the
naked electric force can be

00:44:34.572 --> 00:44:37.457
judged by the simple
illustration in the lower left.

00:44:37.576 --> 00:44:42.430
This shows that if the charge; passing through
two 120 watt light bulbs in one second,

00:44:42.455 --> 00:44:45.489
were to be transferred
equally to two metal plates,

00:44:45.514 --> 00:44:49.656
the repulsive force between those
plates would equal 1 million tons.

00:44:50.743 --> 00:44:54.248
So it's critical that the electric
force is a balanced force,

00:44:54.273 --> 00:44:56.842
attractive or repulsive.

00:44:56.867 --> 00:45:02.482
These two propositions are the epitome
of elegant simplicity balance.

00:45:04.133 --> 00:45:07.622
The little diagram
there on the left,

00:45:07.647 --> 00:45:10.959
extreme left at the top, shows the
attraction between positive and negative

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:14.610
and the repulsion
between like-particles.

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:22.958
There are two forms of the
electric force that we experience.

00:45:22.983 --> 00:45:29.649
One is the electrostatic, we have
separated charge some distance apart,

00:45:29.674 --> 00:45:34.408
and the electric dipole where the distance
between the two charges becomes so small

00:45:34.433 --> 00:45:37.295
that the field is altered and
you get a different effect

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.566
called the dipole field.

00:45:40.217 --> 00:45:44.317
So it just depends on the degree of
separation of a positive and negative charge.

00:45:44.318 --> 00:45:46.442
It's a difference in scale.

00:45:46.467 --> 00:45:51.611
On our scale we experience the dipole
field of atomic electric fields

00:45:51.636 --> 00:45:55.435
and subatomic electric fields in
the form of magnetism and gravity.

00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:57.471
They are dipole fields.

00:46:00.455 --> 00:46:05.458
So, both forms of the electrostatic
and the dipole field

00:46:05.483 --> 00:46:09.685
occur between atoms and is
responsible for chemistry.

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:17.313
The e-force operates between all of the
particles and sub particles within each atom.

00:46:17.338 --> 00:46:20.443
In close proximity this can
result in distortion of the atoms

00:46:20.468 --> 00:46:22.562
to form electric
dipoles themselves.

00:46:22.587 --> 00:46:25.486
Which can result in the
attraction to form a molecule

00:46:25.511 --> 00:46:30.188
or they may enter a new resonant dance
by sharing an electron as chemistry.

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:35.807
The dipole distorting action on electrons
and protons produces dipolar magnetism.

00:46:36.449 --> 00:46:38.865
The diagram there is actually,

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:43.174
I made a mistake, the positive and negative
on the left and right should be reversed.

00:46:43.199 --> 00:46:45.667
But this just shows
that if you...

00:46:45.692 --> 00:46:47.538
just try this thing here...

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:54.568
if you have an electric field
operating on a particle here,

00:46:54.593 --> 00:46:57.262
charged particle here,
and accelerating it

00:46:57.287 --> 00:47:00.987
and on the opposite
side decelerating it,

00:47:01.012 --> 00:47:06.181
the result will be an elliptical orbit
with the nucleus at one of the focuses.

00:47:06.475 --> 00:47:11.211
And the result of this is that
you get a transverse dipole

00:47:11.236 --> 00:47:14.920
and that transverse dipole is
shown there as the magnetic force

00:47:14.945 --> 00:47:17.532
because if you have two
current-carrying wires,

00:47:17.557 --> 00:47:22.879
where the electric field in the wire is
causing this distortion in electrons,

00:47:23.331 --> 00:47:27.321
then the dipoles are aligned
so they tend to attract

00:47:27.346 --> 00:47:30.000
and we know that current
flowing down two wires

00:47:30.025 --> 00:47:33.751
in the same direction attract,
in the opposite way they repel.

00:47:39.092 --> 00:47:42.568
OK, so. And the other
thing is that,

00:47:43.139 --> 00:47:46.721
I mentioned the ultra-week
dipolar gravity.

00:47:48.388 --> 00:47:51.679
And this is the diagram, what
happens to an atom in that case.

00:47:51.704 --> 00:47:54.765
The gravitational field
cannot be shielded from,

00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:57.676
so the gravitational force
operates on the heavy nucleus

00:47:57.701 --> 00:48:01.428
so that it falls towards one
of the focuses of the ellipse.

00:48:01.429 --> 00:48:08.350
This time it's oriented radially
towards the surface of the body.

00:48:12.225 --> 00:48:15.461
But the interesting thing
about that is that

00:48:15.486 --> 00:48:17.538
once you've said that,
this means that

00:48:17.539 --> 00:48:20.799
the body like the Earth and the
Moon, which are shown here,

00:48:20.824 --> 00:48:24.198
the negative poles on both
bodies are facing outwards

00:48:24.199 --> 00:48:26.940
which means they're
repelling one another.

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:35.537
So it means that the, it's long-range
repulsive, short-range attractive.

00:48:35.562 --> 00:48:39.229
We, on the surface of the earth, are
like iron filings. We don't care

00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:43.036
which magnet, we go to adjust,
the nearest one will do.

00:48:45.496 --> 00:48:49.307
The gravitational mass of the distant
galaxies has a fundamental influence

00:48:49.332 --> 00:48:53.200
over the motion of the
bodies in the solar system

00:48:53.225 --> 00:48:57.337
and this is actually shown by precession
of the perihelion of the planets

00:48:57.362 --> 00:49:03.913
which is tied to the distant stars and
not to the Sun or general relativity.

00:49:03.938 --> 00:49:07.912
Because general relativity doesn't
have a reference frame like that.

00:49:08.428 --> 00:49:11.056
Short-term changes in the
Earth's magnetic field

00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:13.516
that occur over periods
of just years or decades

00:49:13.541 --> 00:49:16.364
have now been shown in new
research to have a very close

00:49:16.389 --> 00:49:18.796
relationship with
changes in gravity.

00:49:18.821 --> 00:49:21.784
The two are very
similar, similar forces.

00:49:22.387 --> 00:49:25.212
There is no gravitational
collapse in space,

00:49:25.237 --> 00:49:27.488
no black hole
swallowing everything.

00:49:27.513 --> 00:49:32.227
It is the electromagnetic force alone
that coalesces matter in deep space.

00:49:32.592 --> 00:49:38.718
So the assumption that gravity was the controlling
force on the large-scale is incorrect.

00:49:39.351 --> 00:49:42.652
There's no need for a Big Bang to
separate everything initially,

00:49:42.677 --> 00:49:46.403
gravity is a balanced force like
magnetism and cannot form neutron stars

00:49:46.428 --> 00:49:50.118
or other fanciful super-condensed
celestial objects.

00:49:50.959 --> 00:49:57.839
A planet's gravity is established at its
birth by powerful electromagnetic forces.

00:49:57.864 --> 00:50:03.797
Once the body is formed and the
charge on the surface is established,

00:50:03.822 --> 00:50:07.710
the gravitational field is set
by both the surface charge

00:50:07.735 --> 00:50:13.288
and the initial coalescence
by electromagnetic forces.

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:24.238
So the outcome of
all that is that

00:50:24.239 --> 00:50:28.455
all matter in the local universe is
connected by the electric force instantly.

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.431
That's Mach's principle.

00:50:30.456 --> 00:50:34.035
The origin of mass and
quantum spooky connection.

00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:39.408
Because this force is instantaneous, this
so called, entanglement and non-locality

00:50:39.433 --> 00:50:42.228
suddenly has a
simple explanation.

00:50:42.253 --> 00:50:46.886
And energy is a measure of motion with respect
to the matter in the rest of the universe.

00:50:46.911 --> 00:50:51.934
Mass is a measure of the energy stored
in the orbital motion inside a particle.

00:50:53.704 --> 00:51:00.830
And simultaneity means there is a universal
time and three-dimensional space.

00:51:00.855 --> 00:51:05.192
We return to the sanity and
simplicity of classical physics.

00:51:07.623 --> 00:51:10.155
These matter resonances
are interesting too

00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:13.276
because having an
orbital structure

00:51:13.301 --> 00:51:16.878
allows resonant instantaneous
connections and complex interactions

00:51:16.903 --> 00:51:19.301
which explains weird
quantum behavior.

00:51:19.326 --> 00:51:22.006
The important thing is that
the electron and proton

00:51:22.031 --> 00:51:24.387
have an orbital charge
structure like atoms

00:51:24.412 --> 00:51:28.073
which explains their internal
energy and their magnetic moment.

00:51:28.098 --> 00:51:33.550
And distortion in an electric field appears as
an increase in mass rather than acceleration.

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:36.428
Quantum tunneling

00:51:36.453 --> 00:51:41.189
In transistors electrons face a barrier
like the illustration in the diagram.

00:51:41.214 --> 00:51:43.650
It's like having to carry
a weight over a hill

00:51:43.675 --> 00:51:46.425
but in a weird quantum
phenomenon called tunneling

00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:49.600
the electron passes through that
barrier as if there's a tunnel.

00:51:49.625 --> 00:51:52.330
The Electric Universe model
of the electron and proton,

00:51:52.355 --> 00:51:56.223
having an orbital structure of
oppositely charged particles,

00:51:56.248 --> 00:52:00.506
allows us to see that the hill or
the repulsive electrical force

00:52:00.531 --> 00:52:05.952
between similar charges can instantly
disappear or become a downhill race.

00:52:05.977 --> 00:52:09.030
The reason is that the force
between two similar particles

00:52:09.055 --> 00:52:11.251
can become attractive
instead of repulsive

00:52:11.276 --> 00:52:15.510
if you get the particles together
at just the right moment.

00:52:16.321 --> 00:52:20.536
In chemistry this resonance is achieved
by the use of heavy metal catalyst

00:52:20.561 --> 00:52:23.943
which has numerous internal
subatomic resonances.

00:52:23.968 --> 00:52:29.377
The same catalytic process is available,
in my opinion, for nuclear fusion.

00:52:31.147 --> 00:52:36.227
So called warm fusion is
possible by nuclear chemistry,

00:52:37.904 --> 00:52:41.771
catalyzing the nuclei to
attract instead of repel.

00:52:46.031 --> 00:52:48.638
So catalytic chemistry is
possible, in my opinion,

00:52:48.663 --> 00:52:51.382
in the photospheric
plasma of all bright stars

00:52:51.407 --> 00:52:54.188
where the nuclei are
separated from the electrons

00:52:54.213 --> 00:52:57.506
and can actually come close
together in the presence

00:52:57.531 --> 00:53:00.553
of the heavy elements
we see in the spectrum.

00:53:02.396 --> 00:53:06.540
And you've gotta ask the question then,
is this the path to the future power?

00:53:06.565 --> 00:53:07.642
Like the Sun.

00:53:07.667 --> 00:53:13.709
But only "unlike the sun" that
is believed by present science.

00:53:14.757 --> 00:53:18.539
In this way all-stars generate the
heavy elements in their photospheres

00:53:18.564 --> 00:53:20.819
where we detect them
in their spectra.

00:53:20.844 --> 00:53:26.128
Rare exploding super novae are the most
ineffectual production means imaginable.

00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:30.039
Because having produced it you
then disperse it into deep space.

00:53:31.626 --> 00:53:36.091
There's also an unsuspected resonant
means of connection in living systems.

00:53:36.116 --> 00:53:40.696
The morphic field of Rupert
Sheldrake, the mind-body connection,

00:53:40.721 --> 00:53:43.663
consciousness, subtle energies.

00:53:43.688 --> 00:53:47.169
The Electric Universe model
explains biological transmutations

00:53:47.170 --> 00:53:50.455
at body temperature as demonstrated by Dr.
Louis Kervran.

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:54.833
His is a clear demonstration
of this simple process.

00:53:55.944 --> 00:53:58.814
Is light a wave or a particle?

00:54:01.141 --> 00:54:03.619
If so, what's waving?

00:54:04.024 --> 00:54:07.130
Einstein did away with
a medium to waive.

00:54:07.694 --> 00:54:10.474
Or is light a
particle, a photon?

00:54:10.499 --> 00:54:12.793
It can't be both, a
wave and a particle.

00:54:12.818 --> 00:54:20.140
You'll notice they merely mouthed a
term that it's particle-like, they say.

00:54:21.378 --> 00:54:23.894
It's a meaningless
use of language.

00:54:24.013 --> 00:54:29.382
If so, according to Einstein, to travel at
the speed of light it must have zero mass.

00:54:29.803 --> 00:54:32.904
But a particle of zero
mass has no energy.

00:54:32.929 --> 00:54:36.797
You can't multiply 0 x infinity
and get a real number.

00:54:39.026 --> 00:54:43.555
And if it's got 0 mass it
can't be affected by gravity

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:46.307
so there can be no
gravitational lensing.

00:54:46.332 --> 00:54:51.521
Lensing occurs as a simple atmospheric
diffraction effect in the ether.

00:54:51.546 --> 00:54:54.740
It's like an atmosphere
around the body.

00:54:54.765 --> 00:54:59.014
Evidence from stars at the galactic
center show no gravitational lensing

00:54:59.039 --> 00:55:01.399
as expected from
standard theory.

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:04.859
Clearly, we depend on light
to observe the universe

00:55:04.884 --> 00:55:06.984
but we don't understand light.

00:55:13.397 --> 00:55:15.464
Photons don't exist.

00:55:15.489 --> 00:55:19.465
Light is a transverse electrical
disturbance in the ether.

00:55:20.234 --> 00:55:24.802
And the ether must be a dielectric medium
to transfer an electrical disturbance.

00:55:25.905 --> 00:55:29.499
The wave carries energy
through the medium..

00:55:34.657 --> 00:55:37.197
..catch up here..

00:55:39.093 --> 00:55:44.747
..and the energy is absorbed by the first
atom that is in instantaneous resonance

00:55:44.748 --> 00:55:47.320
with the sending atom.

00:55:47.321 --> 00:55:49.812
It gives the appearance

00:55:51.994 --> 00:55:56.391
that a photon has traveled between
the sender and the receiver.

00:55:56.416 --> 00:55:58.566
It's appearance only.

00:56:02.611 --> 00:56:05.775
Talking about light brings
us to cosmological redshift.

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:10.602
Hubble found, the fainter and smaller a galaxy
appeared -- the higher was its redshift.

00:56:10.627 --> 00:56:14.149
In the diagram you can see the
spectral lines of hydrogen move

00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:17.087
progressively to the red
end of the spectrum

00:56:17.556 --> 00:56:20.960
as the distance is
thought to increase.

00:56:21.207 --> 00:56:25.654
The redshift was simply assumed to
be due to velocity away from us

00:56:25.877 --> 00:56:28.848
by analogy with the
Doppler shift of sound.

00:56:29.403 --> 00:56:32.805
Hubble's law is considered the
first observational basis

00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:35.043
for the expansion
of the universe.

00:56:35.803 --> 00:56:39.524
But ironically, Hubble thought
it the least likely explanation.

00:56:39.549 --> 00:56:42.910
He felt, it more likely
indicated some new physics.

00:56:42.935 --> 00:56:47.808
So it was Hubble's professional
astronomer assistant,

00:56:47.809 --> 00:56:51.543
Halton C. Arp, who later
proved this to be so.

00:56:52.274 --> 00:56:54.925
If the redshift is not
simply a Doppler effect,

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:59.163
Hubble wrote, the region observed
appears as a small homogeneous

00:56:59.188 --> 00:57:05.138
but insignificant portion of the universe
extended indefinitely both in space and time.

00:57:07.138 --> 00:57:11.888
Recently and surprisingly more distant
galaxies seem to be accelerating away from us.

00:57:11.889 --> 00:57:14.944
This discovery won the Nobel
Prize and gave rise to the need

00:57:14.969 --> 00:57:20.299
for huge amounts of mysterious dark
energy to power the acceleration.

00:57:20.324 --> 00:57:25.010
I read about that discovery
on October the sixth 2011.

00:57:25.035 --> 00:57:28.188
The discovery of the acceleration
of the expanding universe

00:57:28.213 --> 00:57:32.005
is an interpretation based on total
ignorance of the real nature of stars

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:35.179
and the standard candle which
was used as the measurement

00:57:35.204 --> 00:57:38.025
to determine the distance away.

00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:42.993
So it's gratifying to find support once
more in a report this month titled:

00:57:43.018 --> 00:57:46.423
"Could a new type of supernova
eliminate dark energy?"

00:57:46.448 --> 00:57:50.532
It has been found that the near-UV
light from the most distant supernovae

00:57:50.557 --> 00:57:52.681
is brighter than
the closer ones.

00:57:52.706 --> 00:57:57.474
In other words, there's something going
on at the atomic and subatomic level.

00:57:58.228 --> 00:58:01.486
Of course, this is
unexpected and unexplained.

00:58:02.383 --> 00:58:06.380
The diagram on the left shows the
difference between the Big Bang universe

00:58:06.405 --> 00:58:08.890
and the Plasma Universe.

00:58:08.915 --> 00:58:11.618
It's easy to see which
one is simpler.

00:58:15.676 --> 00:58:19.847
Intrinsic redshift and Dr.
Halton Arp

00:58:19.872 --> 00:58:23.941
(Hubble's assistant who was
dubbed the modern Galileo).

00:58:24.316 --> 00:58:30.484
He found redshifts, quasars, physically
connected to and in front of,

00:58:30.509 --> 00:58:33.372
high redshift quasars rather,
physically connected to

00:58:33.397 --> 00:58:36.062
and in front of low
redshift active galaxies.

00:58:36.063 --> 00:58:41.350
This observation of a quasar between
the galaxies NGC 73 19 and the Earth

00:58:41.375 --> 00:58:46.419
is impossible if the quasars are over
90 times farther away than the galaxy.

00:58:48.568 --> 00:58:50.439
So, Hubble was right.

00:58:51.098 --> 00:58:53.708
Something is wrong with physics.

00:58:53.733 --> 00:58:57.113
Arp showed the redshift happened
in small jumps or quanta

00:58:57.138 --> 00:58:59.541
which indicates a
subatomic effect.

00:58:59.566 --> 00:59:03.352
But subatomic, these
quantum effects

00:59:03.377 --> 00:59:05.653
are supposed to only occur
at the subatomic level,

00:59:05.678 --> 00:59:07.930
here we've got occurring
on the galactic.

00:59:08.166 --> 00:59:09.699
This requires, once again,

00:59:09.724 --> 00:59:15.146
the electric force to be operating at
ultra-high speed, instantaneously.

00:59:15.904 --> 00:59:20.272
So, quasars are born at high
speed and with low redshift.

00:59:22.445 --> 00:59:28.277
This is Arp's diagram, you see
the parent galaxy in the center.

00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:33.218
This is one here.

00:59:33.823 --> 00:59:39.808
And the high redshift quasars, and the
redshift decreases as they move away.

00:59:39.809 --> 00:59:42.282
Initially their
velocity is very high,

00:59:42.307 --> 00:59:45.204
they are faint,
highly red-shifted

00:59:45.229 --> 00:59:50.347
and traveling at the fair
fraction of the speed of light.

00:59:50.372 --> 00:59:52.164
Over time they gain in mass.

00:59:52.189 --> 00:59:53.252
This is interesting.

00:59:53.277 --> 00:59:56.743
That means that energy is being
supplied to the matter in the quasar,

00:59:56.768 --> 00:59:58.288
the mass is increasing.

00:59:58.313 --> 01:00:00.826
So that eventually they
can actually become

01:00:00.851 --> 01:00:04.264
a turnaround here and
become a companion galaxy.

01:00:05.049 --> 01:00:08.951
This is an example of another
path that they can take

01:00:08.976 --> 01:00:12.370
where you end up with another
Bi Lac objects as it's called,

01:00:12.395 --> 01:00:14.623
producing multiple
galaxies here.

01:00:14.648 --> 01:00:18.681
So there is a genealogy,
if you like, of galaxies.

01:00:19.268 --> 01:00:21.187
The idea that the
Andromeda galaxy

01:00:21.212 --> 01:00:24.765
is going to crash into our galaxy
in the future, is rubbish.

01:00:25.329 --> 01:00:28.575
It's based on the idea that
Andromeda's blue shift,

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:31.289
with respect to us, means
that it's approaching us.

01:00:31.314 --> 01:00:33.921
No, just means that
it's older than us.

01:00:39.939 --> 01:00:43.311
So the Electric
Universe explains this.

01:00:44.787 --> 01:00:47.603
Quasars are born at high
speed and with low mass.

01:00:47.628 --> 01:00:50.926
They escape the forces of the
electromagnetic galactic nucleus,

01:00:50.951 --> 01:00:54.367
that's the parent
galaxy, as neutrons.

01:00:54.392 --> 01:00:56.734
And because the neutrons
have no charge,

01:00:56.759 --> 01:01:01.212
they can escape the intense
electromagnetic forces

01:01:01.237 --> 01:01:04.727
that hold that plasmoid in
the center of the galaxy.

01:01:04.752 --> 01:01:07.819
They have enough time
to get away from the,

01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:11.921
those powerful forces and then they
decompose into electrons and protons

01:01:11.946 --> 01:01:14.625
which are the forerunners
of hydrogen.

01:01:17.371 --> 01:01:21.859
So, as the electrical energy pours into
the quasar its mass and brightness

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:25.085
increases and it slows down
to become a companion galaxy.

01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:30.972
So this was an explanation, the only
explanation for Halton Arp's observations.

01:01:31.538 --> 01:01:36.408
Quasars are not the brightest and
most distant objects in the universe.

01:01:39.678 --> 01:01:43.624
They are among the youngest
and closest, so they..

01:01:44.521 --> 01:01:48.499
the objects in the mirror really
are closer than they appear.

01:01:49.128 --> 01:01:52.899
The visible universe is smaller
than we have been told.

01:01:54.861 --> 01:01:57.679
So the universe, the real
universe, is in balance.

01:01:57.704 --> 01:01:59.450
It is not expanding.

01:01:59.957 --> 01:02:02.764
This is important for
understanding of gravity.

01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:06.200
Gravity cannot be simply
an attractive force.

01:02:07.145 --> 01:02:10.604
The universe is of
unknown age and extent,

01:02:12.810 --> 01:02:15.415
the origin of the
universe is unknown,

01:02:16.350 --> 01:02:21.618
there is a universal now and space
has three physical dimensions.

01:02:21.619 --> 01:02:25.634
This brings everything back down
to, as Tom was pointing out,

01:02:25.659 --> 01:02:28.745
conditions as we
experience it on Earth.

01:02:31.816 --> 01:02:33.534
Dark Matter Galaxies

01:02:33.559 --> 01:02:36.189
Galaxies are treated as
isolated objects in space

01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:40.018
produced somehow by attractive
gravity in an expanding universe.

01:02:40.043 --> 01:02:43.024
Their rotation and structure
remains a mystery.

01:02:43.238 --> 01:02:46.076
They're made of eighty percent
invisible dark matter.

01:02:47.282 --> 01:02:51.971
Tom got a good introduction to
that story about dark matter.

01:02:51.996 --> 01:02:55.863
Dark matter has been described as
an invisible elephant in the room.

01:02:55.888 --> 01:02:59.062
You know it's there by the dent
it makes in the floorboards.

01:02:59.784 --> 01:03:04.721
Dark matter is only inferred theoretically
by using our experience of gravity on earth

01:03:04.746 --> 01:03:07.309
and projecting it onto the
rest of the universe.

01:03:07.334 --> 01:03:09.607
Once again it's the
geocentric problem.

01:03:10.194 --> 01:03:14.867
We look at the gravity on earth and
then we just extrapolate outwards.

01:03:14.892 --> 01:03:17.811
Because that's all
mathematicians can do.

01:03:20.065 --> 01:03:25.041
It needs an impossible gravitational
black hole in the center,

01:03:25.066 --> 01:03:29.501
black holes exist theoretically in
asymptotically flat space in an empty universe.

01:03:29.526 --> 01:03:33.770
You cannot superimpose any other matter
in such a hypothetical universe.

01:03:33.795 --> 01:03:36.187
Black holes don't exist!

01:03:36.212 --> 01:03:42.218
Yet some sport long thin high-velocity
jets over intergalactic distances.

01:03:42.855 --> 01:03:46.191
There's no satisfactory theoretical
explanation for these jets.

01:03:46.216 --> 01:03:49.143
This is the standard, taking
the standard approach.

01:03:49.881 --> 01:03:52.491
Electric Galaxies
On the other hand,

01:03:52.967 --> 01:03:55.779
Plasma Cosmology shows
experimentally and observationally

01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:59.898
that galaxies are governed
by electromagnetic forces.

01:04:00.303 --> 01:04:04.538
Tony Peratt said that
they introduced gravity

01:04:04.539 --> 01:04:08.733
into their super computer runs and
it made no difference whatsoever.

01:04:10.281 --> 01:04:14.035
Spirals rotate as
simple Faraday motors,

01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:16.209
that's why that curve is flat.

01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:19.563
It's as if you've got a plate and
you're just spinning the plate.

01:04:19.588 --> 01:04:23.473
Stars are born in and trace
the spiral power lines.

01:04:24.021 --> 01:04:27.113
Where there is a higher
density of gas and dust,

01:04:27.138 --> 01:04:30.399
it's typical of an electrical
discharge, where the density of the

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.611
material becomes greater, the
discharge becomes more filamentary.

01:04:34.636 --> 01:04:38.078
Stars form along those
pinched current filaments.

01:04:39.546 --> 01:04:41.297
There are no black holes.

01:04:41.322 --> 01:04:44.178
It's a compact high-energy
plasmoid and this

01:04:44.179 --> 01:04:47.709
comes down to peer-reviewed
Plasma Cosmology.

01:04:48.256 --> 01:04:52.056
Their apparent mass is due to the
relationship between mass and energy.

01:04:52.081 --> 01:04:58.028
If e = mc², if you got a high concentration
of energy in that tiny plasmoid,

01:04:58.053 --> 01:05:02.768
it will exhibit a
considerable mass.

01:05:03.776 --> 01:05:05.837
It's certainly not a black hole.

01:05:06.103 --> 01:05:10.249
The other thing is that galaxies
lineup axially showing the electrical

01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:14.254
connectedness because they're threaded
like Catherine wheels on a wire.

01:05:14.255 --> 01:05:19.534
And that wire is one of these intergalactic
Birkeland current filaments.

01:05:23.431 --> 01:05:25.199
So let's look at stars.

01:05:25.224 --> 01:05:27.774
We've done galaxies,
let's look at stars.

01:05:30.107 --> 01:05:33.892
Eddington, Arthur Eddington
had the temerity to say,

01:05:33.917 --> 01:05:37.067
"it should not be too difficult to
understand something as simple as a star".

01:05:37.068 --> 01:05:39.880
This is typical left hemisphere.

01:05:40.665 --> 01:05:42.411
His quote is typical.

01:05:42.436 --> 01:05:46.836
Isolate, simplify and
ignore a global view

01:05:46.861 --> 01:05:51.348
because if you look at coronas, sunspots,
flares, magnetic cycles etc.

01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:56.109
his gas model doesn't
predict any of them.

01:05:56.706 --> 01:05:59.040
And the alternatives
are not explored.

01:05:59.065 --> 01:06:02.020
He dismisses electrical
aspects in a few paragraphs.

01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:05.769
The failure of this approach is
shown by continual complications

01:06:05.794 --> 01:06:07.603
with each new discovery.

01:06:08.089 --> 01:06:11.243
It's treated as an isolated
gravitating ball of gas.

01:06:11.268 --> 01:06:14.514
Conventionally, it's a body
that satisfies 3 conditions.

01:06:15.736 --> 01:06:19.520
It's made of hydrogen
plus a few impurities,

01:06:19.545 --> 01:06:23.480
having core of the lightest element
is the most fanciful assumption.

01:06:23.505 --> 01:06:28.834
It's needed to allow the thermonuclear
energy model to be viable.

01:06:30.961 --> 01:06:35.894
That also requires a hypothetical
extreme conditions in the core.

01:06:35.919 --> 01:06:40.282
It's only required by the thermonuclear
theory and is completely untestable.

01:06:42.726 --> 01:06:44.613
It also has,

01:06:44.638 --> 01:06:46.629
I mean that's unverifiable,

01:06:46.654 --> 01:06:50.521
and also the sequence of nuclear
reactions that take place in the core

01:06:50.546 --> 01:06:52.230
cannot be verified.

01:06:52.255 --> 01:06:56.594
They're very complex and requires quantum
tunneling which I referred to earlier,

01:06:56.619 --> 01:07:00.991
and what's more, there's a more complex
different story for different stars.

01:07:01.016 --> 01:07:03.397
It's certainly not simple.

01:07:04.364 --> 01:07:07.571
It's an explosive model
because one of the reactions

01:07:07.596 --> 01:07:10.703
is sensitive to the temperature
to the fifth power.

01:07:14.385 --> 01:07:18.312
It also needs an
unknown radiation zone

01:07:18.337 --> 01:07:22.209
to break down the x-rays
from the nuclear core.

01:07:22.423 --> 01:07:25.200
There's no body known
that has a radiation

01:07:25.225 --> 01:07:29.178
or the energy transferred through
the body, through a radiation zone.

01:07:29.179 --> 01:07:31.011
So this is hypothetical.

01:07:32.757 --> 01:07:36.618
And also from the point of view
of life on Earth and so on

01:07:36.643 --> 01:07:40.849
it has a restrictive and variable
'Goldilocks zones' distance from the star.

01:07:40.874 --> 01:07:44.721
It's not the best place to
nurture life in the universe.

01:07:47.253 --> 01:07:49.274
Impossible Stars

01:07:49.655 --> 01:07:52.814
Formation by gravitational
accretion doesn't work.

01:07:52.839 --> 01:07:55.267
It's never been explained
satisfactorily.

01:07:55.599 --> 01:07:58.623
It has hydrogen, the lightest
element in the core,

01:07:58.648 --> 01:08:02.076
the model doesn't predict the
observed features of behavior,

01:08:02.339 --> 01:08:06.512
has different models for white
dwarfs, neutron stars, etc

01:08:06.821 --> 01:08:11.099
and the life story of stars is
super complicated and untestable.

01:08:11.124 --> 01:08:14.638
And some stars do strange things,
they switch from one place to another

01:08:14.663 --> 01:08:17.395
without going through
the transition stages.

01:08:17.743 --> 01:08:20.959
Renowned scientists like Eddington
who made grave mistakes

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.525
about the Sun and Einstein's
general relativity,

01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:27.668
he went out explicitly to prove Einstein
correct -- not to test his theory,

01:08:27.693 --> 01:08:29.719
continue to haunt us today.

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:33.266
It gives the light to the belief
that science is self-correcting.

01:08:33.291 --> 01:08:38.013
It is, oh sorry, it is not, given the
way in which science is done today.

01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:43.590
As Eddington said, if there's no
other way out we may have to suppose

01:08:43.615 --> 01:08:47.261
that bright line spectra in the star
are produced by electric discharges.

01:08:47.286 --> 01:08:50.837
The clues were there but "what
if" was not followed through.

01:08:54.304 --> 01:08:57.258
Herschel reveals a
ribbon of future stars.

01:08:57.259 --> 01:08:59.883
This was reported on March
the 30th this year.

01:09:00.645 --> 01:09:02.778
So this is a very
recent picture.

01:09:03.436 --> 01:09:07.584
Stars and planets are formed by
powerful electromagnetic forces

01:09:07.609 --> 01:09:09.361
like pearls on a cosmic string.

01:09:09.386 --> 01:09:11.669
This is a quote from
an earlier report.

01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:13.694
Gravity can be ignored.

01:09:13.719 --> 01:09:17.241
In Plasma Cosmology there's
no gravitational accretion.

01:09:19.285 --> 01:09:22.463
There's no way you can form a
string like that using gravity.

01:09:22.488 --> 01:09:27.384
Gravity is a central force and
material tends to come in to a center.

01:09:27.409 --> 01:09:29.765
It doesn't form a string.

01:09:31.274 --> 01:09:33.924
But this recent report says,

01:09:34.352 --> 01:09:35.686
this is important,

01:09:35.711 --> 01:09:39.490
stars are shot out of the filaments
by a slingshot mechanism.

01:09:39.515 --> 01:09:43.664
And there's a diagram here which
shows the filaments moving around

01:09:43.689 --> 01:09:47.750
like those in the plasma
ball, they snake about.

01:09:48.338 --> 01:09:51.438
The stars having been formed in
this filament are left behind

01:09:51.439 --> 01:09:56.878
as the filament moves on
and these stars are shot out.

01:09:57.758 --> 01:10:03.149
And it's interesting because plasma..
Tony Peratt described to us

01:10:03.174 --> 01:10:06.465
once the effects seen in high
energy discharge experiments

01:10:06.490 --> 01:10:09.936
as these plasmoids
scattered like buckshot.

01:10:10.197 --> 01:10:12.673
Now it's not only stars
that are formed here,

01:10:12.698 --> 01:10:16.045
it's all solid bodies
including planets.

01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:20.414
And they may be captured by the
stars to form the weird assortment,

01:10:20.439 --> 01:10:23.357
over three-and-a-half
thousand of them, so far,

01:10:23.382 --> 01:10:26.584
of exo-planetary systems
that have been observed.

01:10:26.609 --> 01:10:31.427
New stars also may fission to produce
hot Jupiters in very close orbits

01:10:32.504 --> 01:10:36.855
and achieve electrical stability with
their changing electrical environment.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:41.277
The movement of the filaments, as I
said, is like those in the plasma ball.

01:10:41.552 --> 01:10:44.715
Heavy elements convect
into a cool core.

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:48.770
This is interesting because these,
those blue filaments you saw before

01:10:48.795 --> 01:10:52.670
are the coldest part of the cloud and
this is where the stars are forming.

01:10:52.695 --> 01:10:57.564
The traditional view is that the stars
had to form by gravitational collapse

01:10:57.589 --> 01:11:00.389
and not lose any of the
heat of the collapse,

01:11:00.414 --> 01:11:03.112
otherwise they couldn't
start their nuclear fires.

01:11:03.137 --> 01:11:05.287
This doesn't require
any of that.

01:11:07.168 --> 01:11:10.246
It was one of the
surprises for theorists.

01:11:11.137 --> 01:11:13.556
Is that the,

01:11:13.581 --> 01:11:16.823
the blue filament I mentioned is
the coldest part of the cloud

01:11:16.848 --> 01:11:20.031
and contains eight hundred
times as much mass as the Sun.

01:11:20.056 --> 01:11:23.235
This is not a surprise
for plasma cosmologists.

01:11:27.538 --> 01:11:32.101
So, all stars have a
cool planetary core.

01:11:32.715 --> 01:11:34.879
Stars and many planets
are born together

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:37.603
along the same electrical
umbilical cord.

01:11:37.628 --> 01:11:41.944
Other planets and moons are born later
in electrical fissioning events

01:11:41.969 --> 01:11:44.051
and capture events.

01:11:44.654 --> 01:11:48.769
Hydrogen and helium tend to
form the outermost atmosphere.

01:11:51.234 --> 01:11:55.179
This is a diagram showing the
actual form of the filaments.

01:11:55.204 --> 01:11:57.452
You'll notice the pattern there.

01:12:00.738 --> 01:12:05.122
This is showing an experimental pattern
of a discharge on an insulating plate.

01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:09.386
And this shows a Martian
electrical scar.

01:12:09.411 --> 01:12:11.182
You can see the similarities.

01:12:12.896 --> 01:12:16.118
As the cosmic
lightning bolt fades,

01:12:17.293 --> 01:12:20.843
stars and planets are captured
into planetary systems.

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:25.495
So, electric stars,

01:12:25.986 --> 01:12:29.077
they remain a gaseous
electric discharge phenomena

01:12:29.102 --> 01:12:31.997
like spherical searchlights,
following their birth.

01:12:32.022 --> 01:12:34.199
In fact some of the
characteristics of the

01:12:34.224 --> 01:12:37.810
photospheres are like
that of a searchlight.

01:12:40.257 --> 01:12:43.448
All bright stars catalytically
produce heavy elements

01:12:43.473 --> 01:12:45.772
in the photospheric
plasma discharges.

01:12:48.172 --> 01:12:51.172
Red stars have gigantic
anode sheaths.

01:12:51.197 --> 01:12:53.299
Sorry, got the right
picture there.

01:12:54.291 --> 01:12:58.246
Plasma discharges adjust to their
environment by moving electrical barriers

01:12:58.271 --> 01:13:01.321
called plasma sheaths or
misleadingly, magnetospheres,

01:13:01.346 --> 01:13:03.955
because they trap the
magnetic fields inside.

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:06.091
If Jupiter's plasma
sheath would lit up

01:13:06.116 --> 01:13:10.504
it would appear the size of the full
Moon in the sky, at opposition.

01:13:10.954 --> 01:13:15.342
And its Galilean moons would be
orbiting comfortably inside it.

01:13:15.979 --> 01:13:18.685
So red dwarfs are not dwarfs

01:13:18.710 --> 01:13:22.962
and their bloated glowing anode sheaths
are the cosmic wombs for life.

01:13:25.193 --> 01:13:27.559
Because inside that
radiant red sphere

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:31.813
all satellites receive uniform heat
and light over their entire surfaces.

01:13:31.838 --> 01:13:36.209
It doesn't matter how they're moving
or rotating, that will be the case.

01:13:36.826 --> 01:13:39.564
Of course this poses a
problem for the SETI project

01:13:39.589 --> 01:13:43.087
because radio waves cannot penetrate
the glowing plasma sheath.

01:13:43.112 --> 01:13:46.443
So if these are the
wombs of life,

01:13:46.468 --> 01:13:50.038
we don't have any way of radio
communication with them.

01:13:51.124 --> 01:13:54.212
But of course, gravity
can pass through.

01:13:56.157 --> 01:14:00.821
White dwarfs are not dwarfs at all, they're
just stars with no bright photosphere.

01:14:00.846 --> 01:14:03.854
And a faint white
coronal discharge.

01:14:05.117 --> 01:14:08.596
These are some of the planetary
systems that have been discovered.

01:14:08.621 --> 01:14:12.113
You can see that it's
quite a shambles.

01:14:14.096 --> 01:14:17.925
So as I said before, at the galactic
scale electromagnetic forces

01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:21.139
form these gigantic Birkeland
currents and they dominate.

01:14:21.433 --> 01:14:26.350
At the planetary scale, inside the
star's protective plasma sheath,

01:14:26.375 --> 01:14:28.145
gravity dominates.

01:14:28.170 --> 01:14:31.860
So you have to choose the
region you're talking about

01:14:31.885 --> 01:14:38.105
when you talk, when you try to apply
your model to stars, galaxies and so on.

01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:45.917
In fact, the inside the
star's protective sheath,

01:14:45.942 --> 01:14:48.100
with gravity dominating

01:14:48.125 --> 01:14:51.529
and it dominates because it
cannot be electrically shielded

01:14:51.554 --> 01:14:54.908
so the impact from all of the
other stars in the universe

01:14:54.933 --> 01:14:57.810
is acting like a
pressure in on the,

01:14:57.835 --> 01:14:59.851
the planets moving
around the Sun.

01:14:59.876 --> 01:15:02.794
In fact this repulsive force
from the rest of the universe

01:15:02.819 --> 01:15:05.946
can reverse the Earth's motion
about the Sun in 6 months.

01:15:05.971 --> 01:15:11.825
That is 6 sextillion tons
by 140,000 miles an hour.

01:15:11.850 --> 01:15:15.064
So it gives you an
idea of the impact.

01:15:17.652 --> 01:15:23.303
Then the Thunderbolts of the
Gods operate to modify masses..

01:15:24.002 --> 01:15:25.017
oh, sorry..

01:15:25.042 --> 01:15:29.459
In planetary systems the electric force comes
into play only when plasma sheaths collide

01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:32.240
because then the electrical
insulation breaks down.

01:15:32.843 --> 01:15:36.042
And the electric current flows
between the two bodies.

01:15:36.224 --> 01:15:42.056
Then the Thunderbolts of the Gods operate
to modify masses and change orbits

01:15:42.081 --> 01:15:44.893
and to quickly
reestablish order.

01:15:44.918 --> 01:15:47.487
This is one of the problems
that Velikovsky faced,

01:15:47.488 --> 01:15:52.253
how do you explain events,
within the memory of mankind,

01:15:52.278 --> 01:15:55.400
of chaos in the solar system and
it looks like clockwork today.

01:15:55.425 --> 01:15:59.478
This is the answer, you have to
apply the electric model of gravity

01:15:59.503 --> 01:16:01.780
to be able to do this.

01:16:02.209 --> 01:16:05.581
So Velikovsky was right.
Electricity and magnetism

01:16:05.606 --> 01:16:08.439
are involved in the
celestial mechanism.

01:16:09.758 --> 01:16:12.139
Changing the surface
charge on a planet

01:16:12.164 --> 01:16:16.067
Change modifies the strength of
the internal electric dipole

01:16:16.092 --> 01:16:19.153
which is responsible for the
planet's mass and gravity.

01:16:19.178 --> 01:16:24.068
And the changes to both bodies, which
I've shown in previous YouTube talks,

01:16:24.496 --> 01:16:28.534
tends to move the two bodies
apart, which is very convenient..

01:16:29.415 --> 01:16:33.110
This overcomes the objections
of the Harvard book burners

01:16:33.135 --> 01:16:34.895
to Velikovsky's
Worlds in Collision.

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:38.722
However, it doesn't detract from the
title to say that Worlds didn't collide.

01:16:38.747 --> 01:16:41.776
It was an electrical
clash of the titans.

01:16:46.948 --> 01:16:50.157
There's Velikovsky
with his great book.

01:16:53.318 --> 01:16:57.390
So what we have now in science
is a mythical journey.

01:16:58.096 --> 01:17:01.939
It is a rehash of
a creation myth.

01:17:02.824 --> 01:17:07.613
The Earth was born and for four-and-a-half
billion has remained roughly where it is now.

01:17:08.348 --> 01:17:12.420
Long ago the Earth had a few
massive impacts to birth the Moon

01:17:12.445 --> 01:17:15.299
and almost wipe out life
on Earth at intervals.

01:17:15.324 --> 01:17:18.883
Ironically, planetary collisions
have been found essential

01:17:18.908 --> 01:17:24.596
66 years after Velikovsk's book
Worlds in Collision was burned.

01:17:25.453 --> 01:17:29.184
Thousands of exo-planetary
systems don't fit the story.

01:17:29.209 --> 01:17:33.795
There are stars that shouldn't exist, hot
Jupiters that orbit the star in hours or days,

01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:36.479
backward orbits
and polar orbits.

01:17:37.511 --> 01:17:40.148
Life on earth remains
unexplained.

01:17:40.173 --> 01:17:44.823
The odds against random events producing
life are practically infinite.

01:17:46.117 --> 01:17:51.599
The rest of the story is once-upon-a-time,
fragmented, boring and non-predictive.

01:17:51.624 --> 01:17:54.839
We are an isolated and
improbable accident.

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:59.694
That's why we have difficulty imagining
life elsewhere in the universe.

01:18:00.321 --> 01:18:04.515
Alan Alda complains, everybody
is ignorant about science.

01:18:04.975 --> 01:18:09.812
Alda was 11 years a host of
Scientific American Frontiers on PBS

01:18:09.837 --> 01:18:13.650
and he helped inspire the creation of
the Center for Communicating Science

01:18:13.675 --> 01:18:16.087
at Stony Brook in 2009.

01:18:17.914 --> 01:18:19.994
Is it any wonder?

01:18:22.304 --> 01:18:26.390
When this is the face
of science today.

01:18:26.415 --> 01:18:28.788
There is no real
meaning or morality

01:18:28.789 --> 01:18:32.209
in modern mechanistic science to
engage students or the public.

01:18:32.234 --> 01:18:35.028
Everyone thinks it
is all mathematics.

01:18:35.053 --> 01:18:38.703
It saddens me to see so much talent
wasted in the pursuit of myth,

01:18:38.728 --> 01:18:40.933
hunting for dark matter.

01:18:40.958 --> 01:18:43.535
Their heads have
been filled with it.

01:18:46.241 --> 01:18:48.088
Our REAL journey.

01:18:48.113 --> 01:18:51.913
You're looking for the nearest
exoplanet -- we're standing on it.

01:18:52.604 --> 01:18:56.008
Pay attention to the oldest
stories of the celestial gods

01:18:56.033 --> 01:18:59.898
who created the skies
and land we see today.

01:19:00.396 --> 01:19:06.788
Yorro Yorro is a
research book about the

01:19:07.899 --> 01:19:11.453
Kimberley region, Aborigines
in western Australia.

01:19:12.299 --> 01:19:16.456
And they, some of their
stories are so close to

01:19:16.481 --> 01:19:21.696
the reconstruction of the
Saturnian polar configuration

01:19:21.721 --> 01:19:23.999
that it's almost scary.

01:19:25.258 --> 01:19:30.387
And these are the words from the elders and
they were very precise in their words.

01:19:30.578 --> 01:19:33.603
It says, in the beginning
people saw before the Ice Age,

01:19:33.628 --> 01:19:36.697
that the Moon, Sun and some of
the stars had been on Earth.

01:19:36.722 --> 01:19:38.794
In other words, they
were very close.

01:19:38.819 --> 01:19:41.578
One song told about a flood,
long before the last,

01:19:41.603 --> 01:19:44.459
that was brought on by
a star with trails.

01:19:44.484 --> 01:19:49.116
The symbols that testify to these
events are still in the Kimberley.

01:19:49.141 --> 01:19:51.159
The Wandjina creator-figure,

01:19:51.184 --> 01:19:54.446
which is the one you can see on
the front of the book there,

01:19:54.471 --> 01:19:56.969
that features are explained.

01:19:56.994 --> 01:20:01.210
All rings around the head
represent clouds and lightning.

01:20:01.702 --> 01:20:04.679
The big spirit Wandjina
have large eyes.

01:20:04.704 --> 01:20:09.391
This is the eye-god motive that David
Talbott has explained at length.

01:20:09.627 --> 01:20:13.371
They never have a mouth nor ears
and the line between the eyes

01:20:13.396 --> 01:20:17.685
indicates where the power flows
down and it's not a nose.

01:20:17.710 --> 01:20:20.514
And it has, it looks
like a hollow tube,

01:20:20.539 --> 01:20:28.366
which, in the plasma column scenario of
the Saturnian story, is accurate.

01:20:30.369 --> 01:20:33.887
Wallanganda, the
Creator of Wandjina,

01:20:33.912 --> 01:20:38.213
did not create with his hands, only
through his voice, with power.

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:42.158
It reminds me of, "in the
beginning was the Word".

01:20:42.183 --> 01:20:47.201
Andy Hall has recently explained that the
overpressure from supersonic shock-waves,

01:20:47.226 --> 01:20:51.312
that is from the electrical blast
that striked the surface of the body,

01:20:51.337 --> 01:20:53.851
are powerful enough
to form mountains.

01:20:53.876 --> 01:20:58.454
Rock flows until the overpressure drops
whereupon it solidifies instantly

01:20:58.479 --> 01:21:01.045
but retains an imprint
of the shock-wave.

01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:04.364
Those shock-waves would have
produced harmonics and overtones,

01:21:04.389 --> 01:21:07.666
a global sound like a
symphony of giant trumpets.

01:21:07.691 --> 01:21:13.850
There's many traditions about the
creation being associated with sound.

01:21:16.432 --> 01:21:20.550
This little book I bought in Central
Australia on a visit to Uluru,

01:21:20.575 --> 01:21:24.856
that great red rock which looks
just like an asteroid has landed.

01:21:25.269 --> 01:21:32.976
And it also tells a story by
these people in the Kimberleys

01:21:33.001 --> 01:21:36.881
but is illustrated by children
and it's very quaint.

01:21:38.013 --> 01:21:43.521
Yet the story is by David
More Jolly, who's the elder,

01:21:44.322 --> 01:21:47.382
It tells of two suns in the sky

01:21:47.782 --> 01:21:51.111
who lived in hollow
logs, plasma columns.

01:21:52.068 --> 01:21:55.236
There is a period of
intense heat from them.

01:21:55.261 --> 01:21:59.076
Then one sun is attacked with
a spear, the thunderbolt,

01:22:00.854 --> 01:22:04.744
and is bitten by a
snake, cometary Venus,

01:22:04.769 --> 01:22:06.673
who lives in the sky.

01:22:06.698 --> 01:22:10.754
The little sun gets snagged in
the fog of a celestial tree

01:22:10.779 --> 01:22:14.479
which is the Axis Mundi thing.

01:22:14.504 --> 01:22:17.395
The Tree of Life,
the Celestial Tree.

01:22:20.402 --> 01:22:25.991
So this is an extension of the forensic
technique that Velikovsky introduced.

01:22:26.016 --> 01:22:28.591
He never referred to the
Australian Aborigines

01:22:28.616 --> 01:22:32.246
but some of their memories
are, seem to be so accurate

01:22:32.271 --> 01:22:35.896
that they are a better source
than some of the more,

01:22:35.921 --> 01:22:40.236
so-called, advanced
cultural reports.

01:22:41.198 --> 01:22:44.793
All of these story elements
makes sense to mytho-historians

01:22:44.818 --> 01:22:49.724
and to the leading plasma cosmologist and
colleague of Hannes Alfvén -- Tony Peratt.

01:22:50.311 --> 01:22:53.508
Accept the best evidence
regardless of its fit

01:22:53.533 --> 01:22:57.683
with modern consensus science
and man-made theoretical laws.

01:22:57.708 --> 01:23:00.401
It is better to adopt the
forensic science approach

01:23:00.426 --> 01:23:03.196
to the evidence for past
events that cannot be repeated

01:23:03.221 --> 01:23:06.688
than to rely on theoretical science
which is based on sets of beliefs

01:23:06.689 --> 01:23:09.520
and a geocentric perspective.

01:23:10.187 --> 01:23:14.109
Use that evidence to develop
a more holistic science

01:23:14.912 --> 01:23:18.306
that brings a phenomenal
real journey to light.

01:23:18.331 --> 01:23:21.990
To be real and useful,
science must be holistic.

01:23:22.015 --> 01:23:24.643
The Electric Universe
is a holistic science

01:23:24.668 --> 01:23:28.379
that applies seamlessly from the
galactic to the earthly to the biosphere

01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:30.939
and on down to
subatomic particles.

01:23:30.964 --> 01:23:35.590
Humanity's dramatic experience of the
electrical nature of celestial mechanics

01:23:35.615 --> 01:23:39.627
would make an awe inspiring
and frightening IMAX movie

01:23:39.652 --> 01:23:43.680
that would make science fiction
seem a pale shadow in comparison.

01:23:44.156 --> 01:23:47.866
But in my opinion, once understood,
there will be no irrational urge

01:23:47.891 --> 01:23:50.699
to revisit doomsday upon
each other and the earth

01:23:50.724 --> 01:23:55.334
under the unrecognized banners of the
prehistoric warring planetary gods.

01:23:56.685 --> 01:24:01.675
Planets bear the scars of their electrical
birth and past encounters on their faces.

01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:06.163
Apollo astronauts commented on the
fresh appearance of lunar craters,

01:24:06.188 --> 01:24:09.358
the event that caused the great
gush across the face of Mars

01:24:09.383 --> 01:24:11.890
appears in stories
from ancient cultures.

01:24:11.915 --> 01:24:15.332
These are just yesterday
in geological time.

01:24:15.357 --> 01:24:19.535
I recommend you to see episode
II Symbols of an Alien Sky,

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:22.392
The Lightning Scarred
Planet Mars.

01:24:23.178 --> 01:24:27.748
We may understand our history and place in
the electric universe for the this time.

01:24:27.773 --> 01:24:31.839
This is singularly important
for our sense of well-being.

01:24:34.133 --> 01:24:36.735
It gives dramatic new
meaning to our lives

01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:40.059
in a sense of responsibility
for our jewel of a planet.

01:24:40.084 --> 01:24:44.262
Without this sense we probably
have no future on Earth.

01:24:46.489 --> 01:24:50.350
Also in the event,
myth becomes science.

01:24:50.739 --> 01:24:54.421
There was a unique myth-making
period and all surviving cultures

01:24:54.446 --> 01:24:57.884
required their stories to be
faithfully transmitted for millennia,

01:24:57.909 --> 01:24:59.948
such was their importance.

01:25:00.585 --> 01:25:04.508
We look at these enigmatic rock art
figures from the remote Kimberley region

01:25:04.533 --> 01:25:09.948
in Western Australia and see only their
strange, haunting and artistic beauty.

01:25:11.614 --> 01:25:15.993
And it was rather ironic
that just a week or so ago,

01:25:17.008 --> 01:25:20.526
and David Novak was there
to see it too I think,

01:25:20.551 --> 01:25:23.071
they had the vivid
festival in Sydney

01:25:23.096 --> 01:25:26.329
where they project images
onto public buildings

01:25:26.354 --> 01:25:30.240
and of course the Opera House's the
the most public building in Sydney

01:25:30.265 --> 01:25:36.122
and this was a presentation
of Wandjina figures.

01:25:37.701 --> 01:25:41.042
I mean they are haunting and
I think they probably evoke

01:25:41.067 --> 01:25:44.177
some kind of a
subconscious connection

01:25:45.931 --> 01:25:51.743
but how much more would they mean if
people really understood their origin.

01:25:52.528 --> 01:25:57.792
We need to give more credit
to the indigenous people.

01:25:58.260 --> 01:26:01.839
Now Even Camp said that

01:26:01.864 --> 01:26:06.173
one of the unique aspects of the Electric
Universe theory is that it's good storytelling.

01:26:06.198 --> 01:26:08.372
It answers all three questions,

01:26:08.397 --> 01:26:10.181
what if..

01:26:10.206 --> 01:26:13.260
What if the sky was
different in the past?

01:26:14.983 --> 01:26:17.990
What if Saturn was
worshipped as the Sun?

01:26:18.015 --> 01:26:21.977
What if there were electrical
discharges between planets?

01:26:27.342 --> 01:26:31.023
What if there were electric
discharges between planets?

01:26:31.048 --> 01:26:33.457
Today, we have
meteorites from Mars.

01:26:33.482 --> 01:26:37.458
What if Lichtenberg figures explain
the scars on Mars and Earth?

01:26:37.864 --> 01:26:40.793
Show students pictures of
cratering on different bodies

01:26:40.818 --> 01:26:43.959
and asks students to explain
them from two points of view.

01:26:43.992 --> 01:26:47.412
The Standard Model needs
different explanations for each.

01:27:01.944 --> 01:27:06.644
The Electric Universe, on the other hand,
has a single explanation for them all.

01:27:07.311 --> 01:27:10.196
Then, there is the story
of the dissidents.

01:27:10.965 --> 01:27:14.759
If only Birkeland
hadn't been ignored.

01:27:14.784 --> 01:27:17.207
Hannes Alfvén had
been listened to.

01:27:17.232 --> 01:27:20.392
Halton Arp's research
hadn't been dismissed.

01:27:20.417 --> 01:27:24.938
A pixar rule for storytelling
number 16: what are the stakes?

01:27:24.963 --> 01:27:27.387
Give us reasons to
support the character.

01:27:27.412 --> 01:27:29.402
What happens if
they don't succeed?

01:27:29.427 --> 01:27:31.190
Stack the odds against them!

01:27:31.215 --> 01:27:34.388
What of the future
if this goes on?

01:27:34.413 --> 01:27:38.603
We continue wasting money and careers
looking for things that don't exist.

01:27:38.628 --> 01:27:41.678
We cripple students by not
training them to think.

01:27:41.703 --> 01:27:44.919
We may have no future
on this planet.

01:27:45.716 --> 01:27:48.331
As Evan Camp says,

01:27:53.273 --> 01:27:59.122
"The power of eliciting engagement is to get
people to come to their own conclusions."

01:28:00.067 --> 01:28:03.884
Thinking is going to be
the future of education.

01:28:07.442 --> 01:28:12.016
So, our Electric Universe Future.
Mahatma Gandhi said,

01:28:12.041 --> 01:28:16.183
"There is a force in the universe which,
if we permit it, will flow through us

01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:18.761
and produce miraculous results."

01:28:18.786 --> 01:28:21.386
The Electric Universe
is an inspiring story

01:28:21.411 --> 01:28:24.618
that motivates students both
conceptually and artistically,

01:28:24.619 --> 01:28:29.452
and that is what's needed for left and
right brain hemisphere development.

01:28:30.174 --> 01:28:35.214
Education, classical science and the
arts, left and right hemispheres

01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:42.131
Many principles of the Electric
Universe were foreseen

01:28:42.156 --> 01:28:45.696
by scholars in the past--
Newton, Faraday, etc.

01:28:45.721 --> 01:28:48.590
A release from existential fear.

01:28:48.615 --> 01:28:53.209
Velikovsky's The Bonds of
the Past, a documentary.

01:28:53.899 --> 01:28:59.339
There is a collective inability to face the
truth that prehistoric mankind faced doomsday.

01:28:59.364 --> 01:29:02.786
For millennia, sciences
preached stability and order

01:29:02.811 --> 01:29:05.284
but as amnesiacs we
have a compulsion

01:29:05.309 --> 01:29:08.204
to instinctively repeat the
catastrophes of the past

01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:12.266
destroying each other and the earth
from the sky with apocalyptic weapons,

01:29:12.291 --> 01:29:14.578
like the planetary gods of old.

01:29:15.277 --> 01:29:18.387
This was one of Velikovsky's
greatest fears.

01:29:24.491 --> 01:29:29.532
But we have, on the other hand, the
possibility of an unparalleled renaissance

01:29:29.557 --> 01:29:33.444
with the Electric Universe, bringing
everything together seamlessly.

01:29:33.469 --> 01:29:35.895
Understanding ourselves
and our past,

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:40.459
can heal the wounds and provide a more
universal sense of connection and purpose.

01:29:40.484 --> 01:29:43.603
Understand the electric
force of nature.

01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:48.984
Power "like the Sun."

01:29:49.009 --> 01:29:50.822
And Gravity.

01:29:52.592 --> 01:29:54.175
Quantum Interactions.

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:57.091
All three rely on understanding
matter interactions

01:29:57.116 --> 01:29:59.564
by the instantaneous
electric force.

01:30:00.159 --> 01:30:06.044
Understanding living organisms, the
mind-body connection and beyond.

01:30:13.033 --> 01:30:20.784
Also understanding the dangers of genetically-
modified organisms and manufactured food.

01:30:22.497 --> 01:30:26.629
There's no thought
given to the effects,

01:30:26.654 --> 01:30:29.731
the unintended consequences
of fiddling with these things

01:30:29.756 --> 01:30:33.256
when our basic knowledge
is so lacking.

01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:42.894
And the idea in an Electric Universe is to
live in tune with the Earth and each other.

01:30:47.376 --> 01:30:48.849
Resonant Connection

01:30:48.874 --> 01:30:51.460
On the most general level,
the Electric Universe is

01:30:51.485 --> 01:30:55.071
a new paradigm of universal
resonant connection.

01:30:55.096 --> 01:30:57.903
The arbitrary inertial frames
of reference of physics

01:30:57.928 --> 01:31:01.283
are not equivalent when everything
is connected in real time.

01:31:01.308 --> 01:31:05.677
How and where you are makes a
difference to your energy state.

01:31:06.217 --> 01:31:09.806
For example, the GPS system is
supposed to prove relativity theory.

01:31:09.831 --> 01:31:10.845
It doesn't.

01:31:10.870 --> 01:31:15.067
The atoms in orbiting clocks have a different
energy from identical clocks on Earth

01:31:15.092 --> 01:31:18.747
so engineers simply count a different
number of ticks to compensate.

01:31:18.772 --> 01:31:22.095
Time is universal,
unchanging and unchangeable.

01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:23.592
Clocks are not.

01:31:23.943 --> 01:31:28.309
Think of the relationships between all things
connected by the universe electric force

01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:31.549
and consider that the electric force
must act instantly otherwise no

01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:36.142
information transfer is possible
between resonant tune systems.

01:31:36.817 --> 01:31:39.799
Spacecraft using slow speed
of light transmissions,

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:43.114
require constant retuning
of receivers on Earth

01:31:43.139 --> 01:31:45.304
to compensate for their motion.

01:31:45.329 --> 01:31:47.580
Obviously living systems
could not function

01:31:47.605 --> 01:31:50.981
if moving parts of the body
lost contact with the brain.

01:31:51.251 --> 01:31:55.532
Acknowledging this simple fact will explain
quantum weirdness and open up science,

01:31:55.557 --> 01:31:59.735
particularly biology, to amazing
possibilities that are presently forbidden.

01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:03.169
And understanding gravity and magnetism
as balancing electric forces

01:32:03.170 --> 01:32:07.833
will change forever our view of the
heavens and the earth under our feet.

01:32:08.516 --> 01:32:13.111
As the morphic resonance experiments of the
biologist Rupert Sheldrake have shown,

01:32:13.136 --> 01:32:17.705
the things that are learned by one organism are
immediately available to others like them,

01:32:17.730 --> 01:32:19.303
anywhere on earth.

01:32:19.328 --> 01:32:21.501
The universe learns.

01:32:21.913 --> 01:32:26.997
Resonance between molecular tuning forks
allows instant information transfer,

01:32:27.022 --> 01:32:30.268
the mind-body
connection and beyond.

01:32:30.768 --> 01:32:32.959
Life is structured water.

01:32:32.984 --> 01:32:35.331
This was said to me
by Gerald Pollack.

01:32:35.356 --> 01:32:38.415
The experiments, or his
experiments, show that structure of

01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:43.025
electrically polarized water molecules
gives rise to water's amazing properties.

01:32:43.667 --> 01:32:47.953
It allows information to be stored and
transferred within a living cell.

01:32:47.978 --> 01:32:50.798
The memory mechanism
of homeopathy.

01:32:50.823 --> 01:32:54.478
It suggests that the electrically
polarizable ether particles may also

01:32:54.479 --> 01:32:58.318
participate in information
storage as well as transmission.

01:32:58.343 --> 01:33:01.169
The Electric Universe resonant
electrical model of matter

01:33:01.170 --> 01:33:04.166
and the all-pervasive
neutrino ether,

01:33:04.191 --> 01:33:07.224
suggests that resonance and
structure within structure

01:33:07.249 --> 01:33:11.159
can store unlimited information
and transfer it instantly.

01:33:11.184 --> 01:33:14.068
There is more to life
than meets the eye.

01:33:14.069 --> 01:33:16.832
We've always known
that instinctively.

01:33:16.857 --> 01:33:20.839
The Electric Universe suggests that
the information needed for life,

01:33:20.864 --> 01:33:24.760
forget the gene -- that's just
the factory floor, is universal.

01:33:24.785 --> 01:33:29.317
So life can take hold wherever
conditions arise that allow it.

01:33:29.342 --> 01:33:31.978
We see evidence for that
in the great changes

01:33:31.979 --> 01:33:36.038
immediately following catastrophic
mass extinctions on earth.

01:33:36.063 --> 01:33:40.133
We see it in organisms living in
anoxic conditions over volcanic vents,

01:33:40.158 --> 01:33:43.246
on the ocean floor and at
great depths in rocks.

01:33:43.271 --> 01:33:45.757
Just as gravity
cannot be shielded,

01:33:45.782 --> 01:33:48.920
since all matter participates
in force transfer,

01:33:48.945 --> 01:33:52.385
so it is with this universal
information bank.

01:33:53.345 --> 01:33:56.002
There are no islands in space.

01:33:56.027 --> 01:33:59.940
We are Earthlings in the complete
resonant connection sense

01:33:59.965 --> 01:34:03.169
in a meaningful
Electrical Universe.

01:34:03.194 --> 01:34:07.913
The fact that we exist suggests
the purposeful universe.

01:34:07.938 --> 01:34:09.737
Our lives have purpose.

01:34:09.762 --> 01:34:11.997
We don't manifest
as a blank slate.

01:34:12.022 --> 01:34:15.929
So, children should be observed and
supported in their individual passions,

01:34:15.930 --> 01:34:19.313
not suppressed and molded
to have desires for them.

01:34:19.338 --> 01:34:23.876
We are born with a purpose but many
need help to discover that purpose.

01:34:23.901 --> 01:34:26.966
In answering the question:
Why are we so unhappy,

01:34:26.991 --> 01:34:31.589
Iain McGilchrist says: "True happiness
is based on connections with others

01:34:31.614 --> 01:34:34.966
and a sense of purpose
beyond the immediate."

01:34:34.991 --> 01:34:38.685
True happiness is one
aim of this conference.

01:34:38.710 --> 01:34:44.223
The new panorama of an amazing shared
history and kinship must change the world.

01:34:44.248 --> 01:34:48.095
In the search for meaning, the
Electric Universe paradigm can,

01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:51.989
as Iain McGilchrist
says, change the world.

01:34:52.014 --> 01:34:55.465
Elegance, harmony and
simplicity of concepts

01:34:55.490 --> 01:34:58.467
are the Electric Universe
guiding principles.

01:34:58.803 --> 01:35:03.316
Thank you.
