00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:08.341
NARRATOR: When a beautiful
young woman in Ohio

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:12.778
met a handsome young doctor,
it was love at first sight.

00:00:12.878 --> 00:00:15.114
During candlelight
dinners, the two

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:17.416
spoke of marriage,
with the ceremony

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:20.853
on a distant beach at sunset.

00:00:20.953 --> 00:00:22.888
But those plans
were delayed when

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:26.292
the prospective bride fell ill.

00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:30.530
When medical science couldn't
find the cause of the problem,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.167
forensic science and
a hidden camera did.

00:00:37.603 --> 00:00:40.473

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:04.898
[music playing]

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:09.568
At 33 years old, Michelle
Baker was ready to settle down

00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:13.272
get married and start a family.

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:16.976
Her dreams were soon realized
when a girlfriend introduced

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:19.879
her to a soft spoken
new doctor in town,

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.649
Dr. Maynard Muntzing II.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.418
I was the happiest woman
in the world at that point.

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:28.421
I mean, he was
every woman's dream.

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:33.826
He was very successful,
very good looking.

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:37.029
NARRATOR: Michelle worked as
a firefighter and a paramedic,

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:41.200
and the two shared an interest
in emergency medicine.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.669
Muntzing was also 33 years old.

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:48.240
Both were divorced, and there
was an immediate attraction.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.576
Within a month,
Dr. Muntzing moved

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:54.514
into Michelle's small home
in Huber Heights, Ohio.

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:58.183
The couple spent weekends caring
for Maynard's two children

00:01:58.283 --> 00:02:00.720
from a previous marriage.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.857
And soon, Michelle had
some happy news of her own.

00:02:04.957 --> 00:02:08.194
She was going to have a baby.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.395
MICHELLE BAKER
(VOICEOVER): He said,

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:11.397
we're getting
married in Key West,

00:02:11.497 --> 00:02:13.833
barefoot on the beach at sunset.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:17.103
I was blown away.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:19.305
NARRATOR: So the two
flew off to Florida.

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:23.042
But on their first night there,
Maynard changed his mind,

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:26.345
asking Michelle if they
could postpone the wedding

00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:28.714
so his family could attend.

00:02:28.814 --> 00:02:30.249
MICHELLE BAKER (VOICEOVER):
I felt devastated.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.518
I also felt like
if that is the way

00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:34.787
that he wanted
things to be, that I

00:02:34.887 --> 00:02:38.057
had to respect his wishes.

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:39.759
NARRATOR: Later that
night, the couple

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.563
went to the Hard Rock Cafe.

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.231
But after they left
the restaurant,

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:49.635
Michelle had severe cramps
and some light bleeding.

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:52.105
Fortunately, with a
fiance who was a doctor,

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:53.939
Maynard reassured her.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.843
He told her there was
nothing to worry about.

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:58.577
MICHELLE BAKER (VOICEOVER):
He just had me lay down.

00:02:58.677 --> 00:03:00.546
He said that it was fine.

00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:02.515
The next day, it stopped.

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:05.718
NARRATOR: After returning
home from vacation,

00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:09.021
Michelle saw her physician,
Dr. John Shie, just

00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:11.757
to make sure everything was OK.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:12.858
JOHN M. SHIE, MD
(VOICEOVER): I'm

00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.227
trying to allay her
concern, because I

00:03:15.327 --> 00:03:16.595
don't think it's a big issue.

00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:19.298
Michelle, I think, was primarily
concerned because of her age.

00:03:19.398 --> 00:03:22.768
And this being her first
pregnancy, she was frightened.

00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:25.104
Her concerns were that she had
a history of endometriosis,

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:27.673
and she thought that
might be a problem.

00:03:27.773 --> 00:03:30.843
But I reassured her that the
chance of a problem was remote.

00:03:30.943 --> 00:03:34.647
NARRATOR: Maynard
purchased this $320,000

00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:37.983
brick house for the couple
to raise their new child.

00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:40.018
MICHELLE BAKER (VOICEOVER): It
was all very much a whirlwind,

00:03:40.118 --> 00:03:41.587
as far as everything went.

00:03:41.687 --> 00:03:45.758
The baby, the
romance, the just--

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:50.730
the unbelievable situation,
all the way around.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.198
NARRATOR: But
Michelle's pregnancy

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:55.434
was a difficult one,
with increasing cramps

00:03:55.534 --> 00:03:56.769
and occasionally, bleeding.

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:02.608
When neither in Michelle's
doctor or her fiance

00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:05.678
could determine the
cause of her illness,

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:10.949
she did a little research of
her own and made her diagnosis.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.954
It was a condition so
rare, medical experts

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:17.089
could hardly believe it.

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.924
[music playing]

00:04:19.858 --> 00:04:22.528
[music playing]

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:25.430
Although Michelle Baker
and Dr. Maynard Muntzing

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:28.267
were expecting a child
and had plans to marry,

00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:33.772
Maynard revealed some news
which threatened those plans.

00:04:33.872 --> 00:04:36.709
He admitted he still
had lingering feelings

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:39.411
for a former
girlfriend, Tammy Irwin,

00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:41.380
despite their stormy past.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.348
MICHELLE BAKER (VOICEOVER):
You have told all these people

00:04:43.448 --> 00:04:46.585
such horrible things about her,
and what kind of person she is.

00:04:46.685 --> 00:04:50.422
And I said, and you still
have feelings for her?

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:53.592
NARRATOR: Over the 4th
of July weekend in 2000,

00:04:53.692 --> 00:04:56.529
Michelle planned to
stay home while Maynard

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.398
left for a fishing trip with
a friend about an hour's drive

00:04:59.498 --> 00:05:00.766
away.

00:05:00.866 --> 00:05:02.801
MICHELLE BAKER (VOICEOVER):
We spent the morning together,

00:05:02.901 --> 00:05:06.205
had a good morning, a
really good morning.

00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:11.076
And he packed some
clothes and he left.

00:05:11.176 --> 00:05:12.511
RADIO DJ: And with
"Prisoner of Love,"

00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:14.713
here on all request hour, Q92.

00:05:14.813 --> 00:05:17.616
Let's go to the request
lines, from Huber Heights.

00:05:17.716 --> 00:05:19.352
Hello, what can I play for you?

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:20.185
MAYNARD MUNTZING (ON
RADIO): Yeah, I was

00:05:20.285 --> 00:05:21.320
wondering if you could play--

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:22.821
NARRATOR: But later that
night, while listening

00:05:22.921 --> 00:05:24.557
to a local radio
station, Michelle

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:28.828
heard a familiar voice
calling in to request a song.

00:05:28.928 --> 00:05:30.095
MICHELLE BAKER
(VOICEOVER): The caller

00:05:30.195 --> 00:05:32.464
sounded very much like Maynard.

00:05:32.564 --> 00:05:34.800
And I was-- I just
stopped right there.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.071
I just stopped dead in my
tracks, and I listened.

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:41.974
And the DJ asked him, he
said, well, who is this?

00:05:42.074 --> 00:05:43.275
And he said, Maynard.

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:44.977
RADIO DJ: Do you want to
dedicate this to anyone?

00:05:45.077 --> 00:05:46.378
MAYNARD MUNTZING (ON
RADIO): I'd like to--

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.213
NARRATOR: Now suspecting
she had been lied to,

00:05:48.313 --> 00:05:49.849
Michelle asked a
neighbor to drive

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.320
her to the home of Maynard's
former girlfriend, Tammy Irwin.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.357
And see, there they are.

00:05:58.457 --> 00:06:01.527
NARRATOR: Michelle's
fears were confirmed when

00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:04.363
she saw him outside with Tammy.

00:06:04.463 --> 00:06:05.631
Fishing trip, huh?

00:06:05.731 --> 00:06:06.598
It's not what it looks like.

00:06:06.698 --> 00:06:07.967
It's exactly what
it looks like.

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:11.170
NARRATOR: A
confrontation ensued.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.005
MICHELLE BAKER (VOICEOVER):
She never knew that Maynard

00:06:13.105 --> 00:06:14.340
was living with me.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.410
He had told her that he was
living with a friend of his.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.613
And all the while,
he was with me.

00:06:21.713 --> 00:06:24.917
NARRATOR: Michelle immediately
threw Maynard out of her home.

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:26.418
MICHELLE BAKER (VOICEOVER):
I was devastated.

00:06:26.518 --> 00:06:32.124
I just couldn't believe that
someone could be that deceiving

00:06:32.224 --> 00:06:38.231
and appear to be something
that they're obviously not.

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:40.132
NARRATOR: But a few
days later, Maynard

00:06:40.232 --> 00:06:44.837
called inviting Michelle to a
picnic so the two could talk.

00:06:44.937 --> 00:06:47.439
He apologized for
his lapse in judgment

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:50.509
and asked Michele if they
could get back together.

00:06:50.609 --> 00:06:51.844
MICHELLE BAKER
(VOICEOVER): He turned to

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:56.815
and he said that he was very
sorry about all of this.

00:06:56.915 --> 00:07:01.821
Seemed very sincere
in what he was saying.

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:03.556
NARRATOR: But the
picnic was interrupted

00:07:03.656 --> 00:07:06.892
when Michelle got very sick.

00:07:06.992 --> 00:07:09.895
MICHELLE BAKER (VOICEOVER): I
was so ill there at the park

00:07:09.995 --> 00:07:11.864
that I couldn't even leave.

00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:15.367
I would leave the restroom
and then five minutes later,

00:07:15.467 --> 00:07:17.870
have to be right
back in the restroom.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.340
Not only was I vomiting
and bad diarrhea,

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.811
but I also about 40
minutes into this

00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:31.117
started bleeding, and
bleeding pretty bad.

00:07:31.217 --> 00:07:34.620
NARRATOR: Michelle immediately
went to her doctor.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.857
He could find nothing
seriously wrong.

00:07:38.957 --> 00:07:41.126
An ultrasound of the
fetus was normal,

00:07:41.226 --> 00:07:44.096
and once again, Michelle
assumed her symptoms

00:07:44.196 --> 00:07:47.199
were stress related.

00:07:47.299 --> 00:07:49.635
With their relationship
back on track,

00:07:49.735 --> 00:07:52.538
the couple once again
spoke of marriage.

00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:54.106
MICHELLE BAKER (VOICEOVER):
He was affectionate

00:07:54.206 --> 00:07:57.943
and he rubbed my back,
watched TV with me

00:07:58.043 --> 00:08:02.114
and it seemed very normal.

00:08:02.214 --> 00:08:04.216
NARRATOR: But it happened again.

00:08:04.316 --> 00:08:07.519
Michelle started cramping,
bleeding, and vomiting.

00:08:07.619 --> 00:08:08.821
JOHN M. SHIE, MD
(VOICEOVER): I thought

00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:11.924
that this was due to anxiety
and stress, and probably

00:08:12.024 --> 00:08:15.795
just internal pressure
that developed

00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:18.997
when she saw her boyfriend.

00:08:19.097 --> 00:08:22.234
NARRATOR: But it was Michelle's
twin sister Melinda who noticed

00:08:22.334 --> 00:08:24.503
an interesting coincidence.

00:08:24.603 --> 00:08:27.973
She had said that,
don't you find it odd

00:08:28.073 --> 00:08:33.078
that every time you're with him,
after he leaves, you're sick?

00:08:33.178 --> 00:08:36.749
And I was just horrified
by what she was implying.

00:08:38.984 --> 00:08:42.821
NARRATOR: Michelle recalled that
Maynard was the one who brought

00:08:42.921 --> 00:08:45.457
the drinks from the bar
to their table in Florida,

00:08:45.557 --> 00:08:50.729
shortly before she fell
ill the first time.

00:08:50.829 --> 00:08:53.666
And he also prepared
her drink at the picnic

00:08:53.766 --> 00:08:57.303
before the second
bleeding incident.

00:08:57.403 --> 00:09:01.073
But what was he
doing to her drinks?

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:04.409
To find out, she
set a trap and was

00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:07.779
clever enough to videotape it.

00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:09.115
[music playing]

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:12.385
[music playing]

00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:17.122
Michelle Baker was becoming
increasingly suspicious

00:09:17.222 --> 00:09:20.192
of her fiance's behavior.

00:09:20.292 --> 00:09:23.396
Maynard told Michele he was
taking his children to Florida

00:09:23.496 --> 00:09:25.430
for a short vacation.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:27.700
Michelle suspected he was lying.

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:33.639
To find out, Michelle
drove to the home

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:40.012
of Maynard's ex-girlfriend
and there saw Maynard's car.

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:43.148
Through an open window,
Michelle overheard

00:09:43.248 --> 00:09:45.518
Maynard and Tammy
Irwin discussing

00:09:45.618 --> 00:09:47.620
Michelle's pregnancy.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.155
MICHELLE BAKER (VOICEOVER):
Tammy asked Maynard what he

00:09:50.255 --> 00:09:53.292
intended to do about the baby.

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:56.328
And Maynard's
response to her was,

00:09:56.428 --> 00:09:59.198
she need not worry
about that, that as

00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:01.867
far as he knew, that it
could have already been taken

00:10:01.967 --> 00:10:02.735
care of.

00:10:05.537 --> 00:10:08.674
My heart dropped.

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:14.513
And it was at that point that
I realized that something

00:10:14.613 --> 00:10:19.251
might be going on.

00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:22.420
NARRATOR: Michelle immediately
told police about her suspicion

00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:25.090
that Maynard was trying
to abort their child.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:26.091
DET.

00:10:26.191 --> 00:10:27.492
JEFFREY F. COLVIN
(VOICEOVER): Well,

00:10:27.592 --> 00:10:29.395
after listening to the story, I
thought it was quite fantastic.

00:10:29.495 --> 00:10:35.233
It's not the typical case
that comes across my desk.

00:10:35.333 --> 00:10:38.737
I was certainly skeptical
at first, and thought,

00:10:38.837 --> 00:10:42.308
I can't imagine that
someone would even do this.

00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:43.608
It's beyond my dreams.

00:10:43.708 --> 00:10:46.478
Something I haven't run into
in 25 years of experience.

00:10:46.578 --> 00:10:49.648
Is he still trying
to like contact--

00:10:49.748 --> 00:10:52.551
NARRATOR: Police wanted Michelle
to take a lie detector test,

00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:54.853
but department rules
prohibit the test

00:10:54.953 --> 00:10:56.588
to be done on pregnant women.

00:10:56.688 --> 00:10:57.656
DET.

00:10:57.756 --> 00:10:58.924
SGT. RICHARD MAY
(VOICEOVER): We told her,

00:10:59.024 --> 00:11:01.127
basically that because of
his professional position

00:11:01.227 --> 00:11:04.162
that we were going to need
all types of physical evidence

00:11:04.262 --> 00:11:08.901
that would show that he's
responsible for this.

00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:11.036
NARRATOR: But
without proof, there

00:11:11.136 --> 00:11:13.238
was little police could do.

00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:16.108
So Michelle conducted
her own investigation.

00:11:18.877 --> 00:11:22.815
Inside a silk plant,
Michelle and her girlfriend

00:11:22.915 --> 00:11:25.617
hid a small video
camera in her kitchen

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:29.288
with a clear view of the
kitchen countertop area.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.657
MICHELLE BAKER
(VOICEOVER): I was scared.

00:11:32.757 --> 00:11:35.727
I was afraid that
he would see it.

00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:39.131
NARRATOR: She then
invited Maynard to dinner.

00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:41.934
As soon as he arrived, Michelle
said she was going outside

00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:44.069
to put the steaks on
the grill and asked

00:11:44.169 --> 00:11:47.206
Maynard to prepare her a drink.

00:11:47.306 --> 00:11:50.242
The videotape clearly
revealed Maynard

00:11:50.342 --> 00:11:55.548
pouring an unknown substance
into Michelle's soft drink.

00:11:55.648 --> 00:11:57.883
When he handed
Michelle the drink,

00:11:57.983 --> 00:12:00.752
she excused herself to go
to the bathroom, where she

00:12:00.852 --> 00:12:02.722
had hidden a plastic container.

00:12:05.457 --> 00:12:07.226
MICHELLE BAKER (VOICEOVER):
As I poured that drink

00:12:07.326 --> 00:12:13.198
into that container, there was
a white sludge in the bottom

00:12:13.298 --> 00:12:15.534
of my cup, an enormous amount.

00:12:15.634 --> 00:12:22.574
I mean, not just a little
bit, but a very large amount.

00:12:22.674 --> 00:12:24.710
And then I rinsed my cup out.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:30.548
I poured my new Coke into that
glass, hid the other stuff.

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:33.352
I walked back out and
sat down at the table

00:12:33.452 --> 00:12:35.988
and ate dinner with him.

00:12:36.088 --> 00:12:43.529
I was sickened, but I knew
that this was the only way

00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:45.197
that I could prove this.

00:12:45.297 --> 00:12:47.833
This was the only
way that I could

00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:51.369
keep him away from my baby.

00:12:51.469 --> 00:12:53.805
NARRATOR: Getting through
dinner was difficult.

00:12:53.905 --> 00:12:56.608
Michelle wanted to get the
drink to the police station

00:12:56.708 --> 00:13:00.612
quickly, and throughout dinner,
her telephone rang incessantly.

00:13:00.712 --> 00:13:06.652
It was Tammy Irwin, asking
to speak with Maynard.

00:13:06.752 --> 00:13:11.724
When Maynard finally left,
the telephone rang once more.

00:13:11.824 --> 00:13:15.560
It was Maynard, with
some upsetting news.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.863
MICHELLE BAKER (VOICEOVER): He
said to me, do you want to know

00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:19.965
why Tammy's is so upset?

00:13:20.065 --> 00:13:24.736
And I said, yeah, why don't you
tell me why Tammy's so upset.

00:13:24.836 --> 00:13:27.105
He said, because she's my wife.

00:13:27.205 --> 00:13:31.510
He married her that week.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:34.580
NARRATOR: The police immediately
sent Michelle's soft drink

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.948
to the forensics lab.

00:13:36.048 --> 00:13:37.349
MIKE WATHEN (VOICEOVER):
My first reaction

00:13:37.449 --> 00:13:38.784
is, you gotta be kidding me.

00:13:38.884 --> 00:13:41.253
We have no idea what
we're looking for here.

00:13:41.353 --> 00:13:43.722
It's not a typical
forensic case.

00:13:43.822 --> 00:13:46.024
So where are we
going to even start?

00:13:46.124 --> 00:13:50.161
There's literally hundreds
of drugs that this could be.

00:13:50.261 --> 00:13:53.498
NARRATOR: On a hunch, police
called a local pharmacist

00:13:53.598 --> 00:13:57.436
asking for a list of medications
that can cause harm to a fetus

00:13:57.536 --> 00:14:01.006
if taken by a pregnant woman.

00:14:01.106 --> 00:14:02.908
The most commonly
prescribed drug

00:14:03.008 --> 00:14:06.912
fitting that description was
a stomach ulcer drug, cytotec.

00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:12.817
The contents of
Michelle's soft drink

00:14:12.917 --> 00:14:14.586
were placed in a
gas chromatograph

00:14:14.686 --> 00:14:15.821
mass spectrometer.

00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:19.157
The chromatograph separates
the various elements.

00:14:19.257 --> 00:14:22.261
The mass spectrometer
analyzes them.

00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:24.095
MIKE WATHEN (VOICEOVER): By
comparing the known cytotec

00:14:24.195 --> 00:14:26.831
that we received from the
pharmaceutical company,

00:14:26.932 --> 00:14:29.301
we compared that
to the substance

00:14:29.401 --> 00:14:31.837
that was found in the
Coca-Cola and found a match.

00:14:31.937 --> 00:14:35.808
Therefore, the Coca-Cola
contained cytotec.

00:14:35.908 --> 00:14:37.075
KIM MELNICK
(VOICEOVER): It's also

00:14:37.176 --> 00:14:40.145
a drug that is used in
a very limited capacity

00:14:40.245 --> 00:14:42.147
to induce labor.

00:14:42.247 --> 00:14:44.416
The actual effects of
that particular drug

00:14:44.516 --> 00:14:48.454
are to actually
start contractions.

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:50.956
NARRATOR: But police
had a problem.

00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:53.826
There was no proof it was
cytotec that Maynard was

00:14:53.926 --> 00:14:56.629
putting into the soft drink.

00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:58.797
A clever defense
attorney could claim

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:01.800
that Michelle laced her
own drink with the drug

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:05.036
in order to frame him.

00:15:05.136 --> 00:15:08.641
So police set a
trap of their own.

00:15:11.643 --> 00:15:12.978
[music playing]

00:15:14.479 --> 00:15:17.449
Even though Michelle Baker had
caught her fiance on videotape

00:15:17.549 --> 00:15:20.519
placing something in
her drink, authorities

00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:22.488
were concerned about
whether this evidence

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:24.122
would stand up in court.

00:15:24.222 --> 00:15:25.390
DET.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:26.791
JEFFREY F. COLVIN (VOICEOVER):
We didn't believe just

00:15:26.891 --> 00:15:30.262
having a tape by the complainant
and a sample by the complainant

00:15:30.362 --> 00:15:35.433
would have as much validity
as a tape by ourselves

00:15:35.533 --> 00:15:40.706
obtained by ourselves, and the
sample obtained by ourselves.

00:15:40.806 --> 00:15:42.941
NARRATOR: So a few
days later, police

00:15:43.041 --> 00:15:47.412
set up their own surveillance
camera in Michelle's kitchen.

00:15:47.512 --> 00:15:51.250
They placed it in a figurine of
a firefighter saving a child.

00:15:54.553 --> 00:15:58.857
The camera focused on
Michelle's kitchen counter.

00:15:58.957 --> 00:16:02.160
Once again, Michelle invited
Maynard over for dinner.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.395
DET.

00:16:03.495 --> 00:16:04.696
JEFFREY F. COLVIN (VOICEOVER):
Myself and Detective

00:16:04.796 --> 00:16:07.165
Sergeant May were
waiting in the garage,

00:16:07.265 --> 00:16:09.634
and viewing what was
going on in the kitchen.

00:16:09.734 --> 00:16:14.639
Like clockwork, almost
identical to the previous tape,

00:16:14.739 --> 00:16:18.243
once Michelle Baker exited
the residence to put steaks

00:16:18.343 --> 00:16:21.914
on the grill, Dr. Muntzing
removed a vial from his pocket

00:16:22.014 --> 00:16:23.415
and placed it in her drink.

00:16:26.184 --> 00:16:27.319
Let's get him.

00:16:27.419 --> 00:16:29.721
NARRATOR: The two detectives
rushed into the kitchen

00:16:29.821 --> 00:16:31.757
and arrested him.

00:16:31.857 --> 00:16:32.724
How are you doing?

00:16:32.824 --> 00:16:33.558
We're police officers.

00:16:33.658 --> 00:16:34.660
Put your hands up. [inaudible].

00:16:44.168 --> 00:16:45.137
DET.

00:16:45.237 --> 00:16:46.305
SGT. RICHARD MAY
(VOICEOVER): At that time,

00:16:46.405 --> 00:16:48.139
I pointed up to the
camera and said,

00:16:48.239 --> 00:16:49.975
right up there,
you're on camera.

00:16:50.075 --> 00:16:54.580
And that's when he viewed
the camera, to look at it.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.448
I said, I told you that you
didn't have to have anything

00:16:57.549 --> 00:17:00.151
to do with this baby,
and instead you tried

00:17:00.251 --> 00:17:02.954
to kill the baby and kill me.

00:17:03.054 --> 00:17:04.322
DET.

00:17:04.422 --> 00:17:05.791
SGT. RICHARD MAY (VOICEOVER):
I mean this guy, had it all.

00:17:05.891 --> 00:17:11.162
In a matter of six minutes,
he destroyed his career,

00:17:11.262 --> 00:17:14.233
and of course, Michelle's life.

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:16.501
NARRATOR: Dr.
Muntzing cryptically

00:17:16.601 --> 00:17:19.304
explained why he had done it.

00:17:19.404 --> 00:17:20.305
DET.

00:17:20.405 --> 00:17:21.406
JEFFREY F. COLVIN
(VOICEOVER): He'd

00:17:21.506 --> 00:17:22.741
basically poisoned the
drink in an attempt

00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:25.610
to remove the problem.

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:29.814
When questioned as to whether or
not the problem meant the baby,

00:17:29.914 --> 00:17:33.018
he advised yes.

00:17:33.118 --> 00:17:35.687
NARRATOR: Lab tests
confirmed that this drink

00:17:35.787 --> 00:17:40.025
was spiked with cytotec, too.

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:46.531
A search of Muntzing's car trunk
revealed even more cytotec.

00:17:46.631 --> 00:17:49.834
Dr. Maynard Muntzing was
charged with the attempted

00:17:49.934 --> 00:17:51.336
murder of the baby.

00:17:51.436 --> 00:17:54.139
JOHN M. SHIE, MD (VOICEOVER):
I think that's just despicable.

00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:56.741
I am ashamed to say
that he's a physician.

00:17:56.841 --> 00:18:01.313
I think that he misused his
authority and his ability

00:18:01.413 --> 00:18:08.620
to obtain a substance, and
then he poisoned his ex-fiance.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.590
NARRATOR: Despite ingesting
cytotec several times earlier,

00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:14.760
Michelle's fetus
appeared normal.

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.294
MICHELLE BAKER (VOICEOVER):
I was the doctor's

00:18:16.394 --> 00:18:18.797
office every week,
had high resolution

00:18:18.897 --> 00:18:20.565
ultrasounds every month.

00:18:20.665 --> 00:18:27.072
They were very, very cautious as
to what they were looking for.

00:18:27.172 --> 00:18:29.007
NARRATOR: Meanwhile,
Muntzing was released

00:18:29.107 --> 00:18:31.009
on bond to await trial.

00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:53.164
NARRATOR: Shortly
before the trial,

00:18:53.264 --> 00:18:56.868
28 weeks into her
pregnancy, Michelle

00:18:56.968 --> 00:19:03.909
gave birth to a stillborn baby
girl, whom she named Mckayla.

00:19:04.009 --> 00:19:06.278
MICHELLE BAKER (VOICEOVER):
She was already gone.

00:19:06.378 --> 00:19:09.180
It was a bad day.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.417
And my parents got
there, and they were

00:19:12.517 --> 00:19:15.053
there when she was delivered.

00:19:15.153 --> 00:19:19.591
My whole family was
there, and my friends.

00:19:19.691 --> 00:19:24.328
And they all held her,
and we passed her around.

00:19:24.429 --> 00:19:31.102
And we all told her how
much that we loved her.

00:19:31.202 --> 00:19:33.972
NARRATOR: Since the coroner
found no trace of cytotec

00:19:34.072 --> 00:19:36.708
in the placenta, he ruled
the cause of the baby's

00:19:36.808 --> 00:19:39.377
death as undetermined.

00:19:39.477 --> 00:19:42.447
He did make oral statements
as well as written statements

00:19:42.547 --> 00:19:46.184
admitting to what he was
trying to do in this case,

00:19:46.285 --> 00:19:48.019
and that he was trying
to get rid of the baby,

00:19:48.119 --> 00:19:50.755
that it was something
his wife didn't

00:19:50.855 --> 00:19:54.592
want him to have to deal with.

00:19:54.692 --> 00:19:56.528
NARRATOR: Michelle
firmly believes

00:19:56.628 --> 00:19:59.297
that Maynard was responsible.

00:19:59.397 --> 00:20:00.398
MICHELLE BAKER
(VOICEOVER): And I

00:20:00.499 --> 00:20:03.734
know in my heart
for what he did,

00:20:03.835 --> 00:20:08.640
my justice is knowing
that he is eventually

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:15.847
going to be judged for that.

00:20:15.947 --> 00:20:18.817
NARRATOR: Because of the strain
a trial would have placed

00:20:18.917 --> 00:20:22.053
on Michelle and her family,
prosecutors made a deal

00:20:22.153 --> 00:20:24.188
with Dr. Muntzing
and his wife, Tammy,

00:20:24.288 --> 00:20:27.392
with Michelle's approval.

00:20:27.492 --> 00:20:30.662
Muntzing's wife Tammy
pleaded guilty to the charge

00:20:30.762 --> 00:20:33.898
of filling the prescription
for the cytotec.

00:20:33.998 --> 00:20:37.636
She was put on probation.

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:41.306
Dr. Muntzing pleaded guilty
to contaminating a substance

00:20:41.406 --> 00:20:46.911
for human consumption and
attempted felonious assault.

00:20:47.011 --> 00:20:50.548
He was sentenced to
five years in prison.

00:20:50.648 --> 00:20:53.117
He was also stripped
of his medical license,

00:20:53.217 --> 00:20:55.587
and will never be permitted
to practice medicine

00:20:55.687 --> 00:20:57.356
in the United States again.

00:20:57.456 --> 00:20:58.990
MICHELLE BAKER (VOICEOVER):
I have a lot of anger

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:02.027
and a lot of hurt, and
a lot of questions.

00:21:05.063 --> 00:21:07.765
And it doesn't matter how
much counseling I go to.

00:21:07.865 --> 00:21:10.168
They can't answer any
of those questions.

00:21:10.268 --> 00:21:14.506
And it's difficult.

00:21:16.608 --> 00:21:19.210
NARRATOR: Michelle
keeps Mckayla's ashes

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:23.248
in a beautiful acrylic
statue, surrounded by angels.

00:21:28.252 --> 00:21:32.891
Fortunately, it was Michelle's
suspicions, good police work,

00:21:32.991 --> 00:21:37.829
and new forensic technology that
identified the drug quickly.

00:21:37.929 --> 00:21:39.697
MIKE WATHEN (VOICEOVER): It
could have been a very, very

00:21:39.797 --> 00:21:42.768
long procedure identifying
this drug, because we

00:21:42.868 --> 00:21:45.136
literally had no
idea where to start

00:21:45.236 --> 00:21:46.704
or what we were looking for.

00:21:46.804 --> 00:21:48.372
It could have taken
us several months

00:21:48.472 --> 00:21:52.210
to determine what we had.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:54.345
NARRATOR: A delay
of several months

00:21:54.445 --> 00:21:57.549
may have prevented police
from capturing the crime

00:21:57.649 --> 00:22:01.319
a second time on videotape.

00:22:01.419 --> 00:22:05.090
