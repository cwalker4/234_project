00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:04.570
We may call some catastrophes “accidents,”
but in other cases decisions are made — by

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.460
those ordinarily trusted to make the right
call — that are so poor they become truly

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.180
remarkable in their negligence.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.159
In this account, we profile 10 shocking disasters
and significant crises that were brought about

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:20.960
largely through some extraordinarily bad choices.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.310
Some of these are well known, others more
obscure.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.439
But one thing is for certain: some truly horrendous
decisions played huge roles in these terrible

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:31.519
disasters…

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:32.609
10.

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:37.629
Air France Air Show Crash (France)

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.309
A decision to involve an airliner carrying
actual passengers in an air show seems like

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.420
the epitome of a terribly bad idea.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.270
While disastrous, it is not so shocking, perhaps,
that this decision led to a fatal crash of

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.379
the said airliner.

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.539
Remarkably, just three of the people onboard
an ill-fated Air France Airbus A320 that joined

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.500
a French air show exhibit died in the ensuing
crash in a forest.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.410
On June 26, 1988, Air France Flight 296 crashed
into the woods near the runway at Mulhouse-Habsheim

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.640
Airport while flying in the Habsheim airshow
and attempting a risky maneuver with passengers

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.640
onboard.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.140
The aircraft was recklessly showing off the
Airbus A320’s fly-by-wire safety features

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.810
and control systems, tempting fate by flying
at a low altitude of just 100 feet in a low

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.040
speed pass.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.920
The senseless decision to involve the airplane
in the airshow combined three big no-nos.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.870
First, involving passengers in air show maneuvers;
second, attempting to “test” safety features;

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.860
and third, a lack of preparation.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.860
The pilots had not even been shown a map with
the forest at the end of the runway, with

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.100
which they collided.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.400
Three people died in the burning wreckage
while many more escaped, some with significant

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.400
injuries.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.400
9.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.330
Vajont Dam Disaster (Italy)

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.540
The failure of a dam is a catastrophe that
can cause extreme loss of life due to the

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.300
overlap of settled lowland areas and valleys,
with the low levels water will find when accidently

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.720
and suddenly released.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.460
A classic example of terrible decision making
with a horrendous cost in human lives was

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.720
an enormous landslide from unstable mountain
terrain into the new reservoir of the Vajont

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.920
Dam, completed in Erto e Casso, a municipal
jurisdiction north of Venice.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.620
The result of the landslide was a disastrous
water displacement that formed a human-caused

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.250
tsunami that towered 820 feet in height as
it roared over the top of the new dam, causing

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.320
relatively little damage to the structure
itself but sweeping 1,910 people away to their

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.490
deaths as it obliterated multiple municipalities
below.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.230
The poor decision?

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.810
Ignoring expert advice.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.930
The geology of Monte Toc, the mountain in
the area in which the gigantic dam was constructed,

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.180
was known to be unstable as indicated by natural
evidence and had discussed in reports.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.240
However, both the company that built the dam
and the government of Italy failed to heed

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.950
warnings, dismissing them until efforts to
shore up the collapse were far too little,

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.130
too late.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.130
8.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.990
The Queen of the North Sinking (Canada)

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.732
British Columbia’s coastline is dotted with
islands, including Vancouver Island and Haida

00:03:08.732 --> 00:03:12.400
Gwaii as well as many smaller islands off
the shore of Canada’s coast.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.630
The ferries traveling these routes are known
as being very safe and strictly regulated

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.890
by Transport Canada.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.320
However, a disastrous crash into Gil Island
by the passenger ferry Queen of the North

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.560
and its subsequent sinking on March 22, 2006
led to BC Ferries navigator Karl Lilgert being

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.709
arrested and imprisoned for four years as
a result of being found guilty of two counts

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.380
of criminal negligence causing death, under
Canada’s Criminal Code.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.440
While 99 of the 101 passengers onboard the
ship survived the crash and sinking, one couple

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.160
was lost at sea and their bodies were never
found.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.460
Supreme Court judge Sunni Stromberg-Stein
pointed to personal interactions between the

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.349
navigator and the quartermaster taking precedence
of the duty to pilot the ship in convicting

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:54.349
the defendant.

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.340
Lilgert and quartermaster Karen Briker had
previously ended a complicated and untidy

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.060
love affair, and their time on the bridge
was the first time they were together again

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.790
since their relationship had ended.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.870
After heading at full speed into Gill Island,
the boat sank to the sea floor, later being

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.220
spotted by a submersible at a depth of 1,401
feet.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.220
7.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.340
Chernobyl (Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic,
Soviet Union)

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.150
The disastrous explosion of the Chernobyl
plant is known worldwide for causing immediate

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.400
deaths, and had health and environmental impacts
that continue to the present day.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.680
But what caused that disaster, and why did
it occur?

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.919
The answer is poor engineering and operational
negligence, a perfect storm that led to immense

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.199
nuclear fallout.

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:43.889
In April 1986, Pripyat, now a ghost town in
what was then the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.840
Republic in the Soviet Union, was rocked by
the now notorious explosion of the Chernobyl

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.430
nuclear power plant.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.870
While the disaster is well known, lesser known
are the facts.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.849
The explosion was a world-changing disaster
that became the first nuclear plant accident

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.099
in history to cause human fatalities.

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:05.699
Substandard equipment making up the reactor
meant that Chernobyl was prone to unstable

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:09.740
operation and possible meltdowns if strict
parameters were not met.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.550
This vulnerability was coupled with flagrant
violation of rules based on technical specifications

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.139
leading up to the overheating of the reactor,
which was unstable at low temperatures.

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.360
Workers ran the facility at a low temperature,
acting without taking due care.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.059
The catastrophic explosion that followed left
the reactor core exposed.

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:31.330
Numerous deaths from radiation exposure have
followed, while plans are in place for yet

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.440
more entombment of the site to further mitigate
radiation release.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.440
6.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.879
Japan Airlines Flight 123 (Japan)

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:43.460
Aviation disasters are terrible enough when
one bad decision gives rise to loss of life,

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.360
but worse yet when a bad decision causes a
disaster scenario where the rescue that follows

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.599
is bungled with yet further bad decisions,
leading to pointlessly increased deaths.

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:58.779
The crash of Japan Airlines Flight 123 was
the deadliest single aircraft crash in aviation

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:04.870
history, an accident involving just one plane,
a gigantic Boing 747 “jumbo jet.”

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.860
The disaster was caused in the first place
by what has been called a poor repair job

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.219
in the tail region of the aircraft by Boeing.

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:16.379
After the explosive depressurization incident,
the ill-fated Boeing 747 lost significant

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:21.490
sections of tail surfaces and control function,
crashing into a ridge near Mount Fuji.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.900
But what happened next was another terrible
decision.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.039
The US Air Force arrived in the vicinity of
the crash within 20 minutes of impact, yet

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:30.199
was ordered to leave.

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:34.560
The choice was made by the Japanese government
to reject US Air Force assistance, stating

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.020
that the Japan National Self-Defense Force
would handle the rescue themselves.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.310
After a shocking 14-hour delay, the Japanese
forces finally reached the crash site.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.460
After combing the area, the rescuers found
a total of four survivors.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.729
Tragically, many bodies were found exhibiting
signs of having unnecessarily died while needlessly

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:56.300
waiting for Japanese help, when American assistance
had been readily available.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.300
5.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.229
Rana Plaza Collapse (Bangladesh)

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:03.629
Unsatisfactory working conditions in what
are termed sweatshops have raised significant

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:04.629
concerns.

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:08.339
One of the most unsettling disasters stemming
from a combination of terrible choices and

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:13.099
workmanship was the collapse of the Rana Plaza,
close to Dhaka in Bangladesh.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:18.669
The worst industrial accident in the history
of Bangladesh led to 1,100 worker deaths,

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:23.539
with 2,500 survivors, many of whom suffered
devastating injuries.

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:24.939
Why did this happen?

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:29.009
Terrible decisions were made, bad enough to
be prosecuted as criminal offenses.

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:33.099
Building owner Sohel Rana was charged with
multiple criminal offenses, murder among them,

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:36.490
while 37 additional people faced charges including
murder.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.520
What exactly did they do wrong that could
lead to so many deaths?

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.870
Well, adding three additional levels to the
building (against the provisions of the applicable

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.879
building code) and then packing the building
with equipment was too much for the building

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:49.089
structure to hold.

00:07:49.089 --> 00:07:53.789
Sohel, plus 17 individuals, were specifically
charged with building code violations.

00:07:53.789 --> 00:07:57.469
Stress led to a loss of structural integrity
as evidenced by cracks.

00:07:57.469 --> 00:08:01.569
The disaster did not occur without any warning,
however, further aggravating the negligence

00:08:01.569 --> 00:08:03.229
characterizing the case.

00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:07.080
When the building showed signs of structural
failure, employees expressing concern were

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.349
told to ignore the problem and enter the structure.

00:08:10.349 --> 00:08:11.349
4.

00:08:11.349 --> 00:08:13.619
Sampoong Department Store Collapse (South
Korea)

00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:18.699
The June 29, 1995 collapse of the Sampoong
Department Store, an enormous luxury shopping

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:24.270
destination in Seoul, South Korea, killed
502 people in what was one of the most protracted

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.289
and horrific disasters in the history of commercial
buildings.

00:08:27.289 --> 00:08:31.550
The tragedy was not just caused by a single
poor decision; it was the culmination of a

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:36.930
series of very poor decisions with serious
elements of criminal negligence and misconduct.

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:41.460
Started on a former garbage dump site, the
enormous building was initially constructed

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:46.380
as an apartment building, but owner Lee Joon
changed the plans to instead become a commercial

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.380
project.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.829
This resulted in critical support structures
in the building being knocked out to make

00:08:50.829 --> 00:08:55.259
way for elevators, plus installation of an
additional floor with a heavy pool.

00:08:55.259 --> 00:08:59.240
When construction workers expressed their
disapproval, citing the risks, they were fired

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.440
and traded in for a “cooperative” crew.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.079
Next, cheap concrete and an inadequate number
of steel support rods were used, all to save

00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:07.079
money.

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:11.160
Finally, bribes were used to get past inspections,
with 12 inspectors later being convicted for

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.430
accepting the cash.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:16.680
The building enjoyed great commercial success,
with 40,000 daily visitors.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.839
When a gas leak occurred, Lee Joon would not
close the store.

00:09:19.839 --> 00:09:24.360
As collapse indicators appeared two days later,
merchandise of value was moved and executives

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.360
left early.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.850
When the ceiling fell, the whole building
collapsed.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:28.850
3.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.170
The Halifax Explosion (Canada)

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.839
World War I involved significant efforts by
multiple countries to contribute a strong

00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:36.350
war effort in a hurry.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.421
War effort measures may be intended to bring
a war to an end and limit deaths, but war

00:09:40.421 --> 00:09:45.810
is no excuse for excess haste that results
in undue loosening of adherence to laws required

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.209
to keep civilians safe.

00:09:47.209 --> 00:09:52.510
The French vessel SS Mont Blanc, loaded with
a highly explosive cargo consisting of TNT,

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:58.740
picric acid, gun cotton, and benzol, was hit
by the Norwegian ship SS Imo on December 6,

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.540
1917 off Halifax in the Canadian province
of Nova Scotia.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:07.569
The ensuing blast, the Halifax Explosion,
remains the worst explosion in Canadian history

00:10:07.569 --> 00:10:11.250
and the largest explosion in the world prior
to nuclear weapon development.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:16.850
Nearly 2,000 deaths resulted, while 9,000
people were injured — many permanently disabled

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.269
with injuries including loss of sight.

00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:22.139
The devastation was extraordinary in its scale.

00:10:22.139 --> 00:10:26.740
In addition to the obliterative impact of
the blast itself, a tsunami was created by

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:31.610
the explosion which, together with the blast,
destroyed the north portion of Halifax.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.230
Why did the collision occur?

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:37.399
The French vessel had right of way, but the
Norwegian ship was hastily and carelessly

00:10:37.399 --> 00:10:39.459
rushing to leave with war supplies.

00:10:39.459 --> 00:10:43.790
Further proceedings led the French vessel
to receive blame for the accident, as well.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:48.000
Despite the dangerous cargo carried by the
SS Mont Blanc, there was no protocol in place

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.329
to mandate safety procedures.

00:10:50.329 --> 00:10:51.329
2.

00:10:51.329 --> 00:10:54.350
Herald of Free Enterprise Sinking (Belgium)

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:58.780
Disasters caused by cheapness and carelessness
are some of the most infuriating to occur.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.509
The combination of extreme penny pinching
and gross negligence, with an extraordinary

00:11:00.509 --> 00:11:02.570
case of passing the buck, is simply a recipe
for disaster.

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:08.080
The sinking of the British ferry Herald of
Free Enterprise on March 6, 1987 was a horrendous

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.010
maritime disaster that killed 193 people onboard.

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:16.620
Rushed departures in a bid to speed up service
times were a practice that led to ferry doors

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.310
being shut after departures, and not before.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:24.089
If someone forgot to shut the door, the results
could be disastrous, and that is exactly what

00:11:24.089 --> 00:11:25.089
happened.

00:11:25.089 --> 00:11:28.930
The assistant boatswain, Mark Stanley, failed
in his duty to shut the ferry’s doors and

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:33.790
was instead sleeping in his cabin, while other
crew either assumed he would shut them or

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:34.840
already had.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:39.259
The first officer, Leslie Sabel, claimed to
have believed he’d seen the assistant boatswain

00:11:39.259 --> 00:11:40.870
coming to close the doors.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:45.180
The defense of boatswain Terence Ayling was
to say that it “was not his job” to shut

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.180
the doors.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.330
The captain assumed they had been closed.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.930
Worse yet, the head of Townsend Thoresen (the
company that owned and operated the ferry)

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:57.260
had refused to spend a measly £5 on a warning
device that would indicate if the doors had

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.260
been shut.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.260
1.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.060
Hyatt Regency Walkway Collapse (United States)

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.740
Engineering standards in the United States
are known to be rigorous, and for good reason.

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.670
Public safety depends on properly constructed
buildings.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:13.089
But one of the grisliest accidents in the
history of building failure occurred on July

00:12:13.089 --> 00:12:18.889
17, 1981 when Kansas City saw the worst building
collapse prior to the World Trade Center.

00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:24.500
A total of 114 deaths resulted, with many
ghastly injuries becoming apparent as trapped

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.769
victims were freed.

00:12:25.769 --> 00:12:29.180
Great difficulty was encountered in removing
debris pinning down survivors.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.110
One unfortunate individual even had their
leg amputated by a surgeon using a chainsaw

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.899
in the desperate emergency conditions.

00:12:35.899 --> 00:12:39.310
The disaster remains a textbook case of engineering
negligence.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:43.690
Tie rod installations supporting the walkway
were found to be in violation of city building

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:48.269
codes, and negligence including approving
changes by phone were pinned on the engineering

00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:49.269
company responsible.

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:53.329
The company lost its engineering licence,
while all the engineers involved were stripped

00:12:53.329 --> 00:12:55.509
of their professional standing and licenses.

00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:58.990
The loads placed on the tie rods, stemming
from a design change performed without proper

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:03.910
calculations, led to not only the fourth floor
being supported by the inadequate rods but

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.040
also the second floor hanging beneath it.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:23.010
The tie rods were also positioned 
in a weak spot.
