00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
They were seen on the most significant
missions like Apollo, Skylab and the

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.719
Space Shuttle. They've been used for the
SpaceX Falcon Heavy and they'll be there

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.089
on the upcoming SLS missions but they're
hardly ever talked about and without

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.199
them who simply wouldn't be able to get
the rockets off the ground, what are they?

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.359
they were the gateway to the moon
and the starting point for every space

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.410
shuttle mission. NASA launch pads 39a and
39b so what do these massive feats of

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.590
engineering do and just how important
are they.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.720
NASA has over 40 launch pads in various
locations from the US mainland to the

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.000
Pacific. Their position chosen to best
get the spacecraft to the correct orbit

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.489
and to be safely away from population
centers. Cape Canaveral in Florida is

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.560
better for launching spacecraft
requiring a west-east orbit and others

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.850
like Vandenberg in California are
preferred for spacecraft requiring a

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.149
north/south orbit but wherever they are
the launch pads themselves are vitally

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.740
important pieces of equipment for first
and foremost holding the rocket

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.229
vertically which is no mean feat when
you consider the size of a Saturn 5

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:38.020
which at launch weighed 2938 tons and
stood 17.6 meters taller

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.330
than the Statue of Liberty at a 110 meters the same as a 36

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.490
story building. The launch complex at
Cape Canaveral started its rocket career

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.770
in 1948 after the Naval Air Station
there was transferred from the Navy to

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.830
the Air Force for testing of captured
German V2 rockets. This went on to

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.110
missile testing and rocket technology
throughout the 1950s until NASA was

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.720
formed in 1958 and it became the future
for manned and unmanned missions

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.140
including project mercury and Gemini. In
1961 when President Kennedy announced

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.090
the moon missions Cape Canaveral was
chosen to be the base for Apollo this

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.580
also meant that it would need a massive
expansion with NASA taking an extra 550

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.160
square kilometers of
land and the launch complex 39 would be

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.800
designed to handle the most powerful
rocket yet designed of a Saturn V.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.470
Work started in 1962 and was completed
by 1965 there were to be three launch

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.700
pad 39A, B and C and in two more D and E
later. In the end only two ended up being

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.680
built named 39A and in just north of
that 39B.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.850
Because the area is just above sea level
the flame trenches could not be placed

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.770
below ground level due to the water
table being very close to the surface so

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.220
the launch pads were raised by 13 meters
and look like concrete hills. Because of

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.190
the way NASA designed by Saturn V  there
was no permanent launch umbilical tower

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.810
at the launch pad. That's the part which
is next to the rocket to take off and

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.780
supplies it with fuel electrical power
and access for the crew. Instead the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.540
tower was integrated into a mobile
launcher platform. The Saturn V would be

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.880
assembled directly onto the platform
along with the tower. This was part of

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.410
NASA's Assembly schedule that meant that
the rocket was assembled vertically and

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.200
then moved with its tower to the launch
pad. This contrasts with the Soviets

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.580
which assembled their rockets as they
lay on their side and then moved them to

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.660
the launch pad horizontally where they
were then lifted into the vertical

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.300
position before launch. Now you may well
ask why did NASA choose a vertical

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.709
integration and the Soviets horizontal.
Well when the Saturn was being designed

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.300
it was thought that even bigger rockets
like the Nova would follow. NASA

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.100
concluded that it would be easier to
assemble the rocket vertically directly

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.600
onto a mobile launch platform and then
move the whole thing to the launch area

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.100
rather than assembling it and then
moving it on its side and then lifting

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.750
it up at the launch pad. This was because
they thought that the engineering

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.720
challenges of lifting a 110 meter or
larger rocket were just not worth it and

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.730
but it would place too much stress on
the rockets body. Now some of you will be

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:49.100
saying that a Soviet N1 was almost as
big as the Saturn 5 and that was built

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.320
horizontally and cranked up to the
vertical position but it required a huge

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.380
complex mobile structure to lift it and
it was moved on to parallel railway

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.300
lines with two locomotives. Building the
Saturn vertically required the largest

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.699
single storey building in the world
the VAB or the Vehicle Assembly Building

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:15.069
which at a 160 meters tall
is where the new SLS rocket will also be

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:21.639
assembled. Built between 1962 and 65 the
VAB was capable of preparing up to four

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:26.710
Saturn V's at the same time and each
of the four doors are the largest in the

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.130
world to allow a complete Saturn rocket
assembly to go out to the launch pad. For

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.880
Apollo the pre-built sections of a
Saturn 5 were delivered to the Vehicle

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.780
Assembly Building from around the US.
Here they were stacked on top of each

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.550
other to form the rocket. On the Saturn 5
the rocket was held down to the launch

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.650
platform by massive hold down arms which would release at launch whereas the

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.909
shuttle was bolted to the platform
through the solid rocket boosters using

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:58.449
frangible nuts,
these are nuts which are explosively

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:04.030
split at liftoff rather than using
explosive bolts. In order to get the

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:09.250
rocket and the mobile launcher platform
from the VAB to the launch area there

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.159
were two crawler transporters which
drive under the mobile launch platform

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:19.240
lifted up and then move it to the launch
complex. When these 2700

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.370
ton vehicles were delivered in
1965 for the Apollo program they were

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:30.159
the largest self powered land vehicles
in the world. Not only do they carry the

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:35.620
rocket and the mobile launcher at about
1.6 kilometers per hour they also keep a

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.000
whole assembly level as he ascends the
3%

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.729
ramp to the launch pad 39A and B. It's
laser-guided leveling system could keep

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:50.259
the top of a Saturn V within 30
centimeters vertically of the base.

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:54.580
Once the mobile launch platform had
reached the launch pad it was set down

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.080
and the crawler transporter returned to
the Vehicle Assembly Building and no it

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.039
didn't need to do a massive three-point
turn it could be driven from either end

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:08.710
so it just returned the way came.
Even the road that connects the VAB to

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.270
the launch pad known as the crawlerway
had to be specially built with a very

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.980
low friction surface due to the weight
of the rocket the launcher platform and

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:26.290
the crawler which came in at some 8,165 tons. The material chosen was Alabama

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:31.050
River gravel for its unique combination
of qualities and it's still in use today.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:36.310
With the Apollo launches the Saturn 5
was attached of a launcher platform and

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:41.440
the launch umbilical tower or LUT.
Although it looks like the tower is

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.000
holding the Saturn up that was done with
hold down arms at the base of a rocket.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.980
The tower was actually there to supply
fuel electrical power and crew access

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.600
via the nine service arms which can be
seen swinging away from the rocket at

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.970
launch. At the top of the LUT
was the crew access walkway and the

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:06.460
white room from which the crews would
then enter the command module. The pad

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:11.740
leader for every manned Apollo mission
was Guenter Wendt. He would perform the

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:16.300
final checks, strapped for crew into the
capsule, shake their hands and offer

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:21.280
words of support and then close the
hatch. The last major piece of

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:26.560
infrastructure was mobile service
structure or the MSS. This was a large

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.360
lattice like platform which has also
moved around by the crawlers. At the top

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.620
of this which was a little shorter than
the launch Tower was a section that would

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:40.240
completely enclosed the top of the
Saturn 5 and the command module to

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.100
provide weather protection and access
for technicians as well as a cleanroom

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:51.220
for preparations before the flight. The
mobile service structure was also used

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:56.830
to place the linear explosive charges
that would separate the stages in flight

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:02.320
and charges along the fuel and
oxidizer tanks for "fuel dispersion" in

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.910
the event that the rocket had to be
destroyed if it veered off course during

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:13.180
the launch. The MSS would be moved away
from a Saturn 8 hours before the launch

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:19.480
and was parked between pads 39 a and B
on the crawl away when not in use.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.620
One of the other jobs that the launcher
platform had to do when it was in

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:28.270
position was to precisely match up with
the pipe work for the fuel and

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:33.480
electrical supply system which can be
seen running up the side of the LUT.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:40.300
The fuel which for Saturn 5 youth was RP-1, a highly refined version of kerosene

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:45.730
and LOX or liquid oxygen. This was used
for the first stage and liquid hydrogen

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:50.800
and liquid oxygen were used for the
second and third stages. This was pumped

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:56.290
aboard whilst the Saturn was at the
launch pad. Other hypergolic fuels those

00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:01.300
that combust on contact with each other
were also pumped aboard at this time and

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:06.520
used for the ignition of the F-1 engines and
for the lunar landers descent and ascent

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:12.460
engines. In the event of a problem like a
major fuel leak whilst the Saturn was

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:16.350
being prepared and providing but it
didn't just blow up on a spot

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:21.790
technicians and crews were trained in an
escape procedure that used a special

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:26.320
high-speed elevator that would get them
from the top of the tower to the

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:33.310
launch platform in under 30 seconds. From
here they would then slide down a 61

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:39.370
meet a deceleration slide to the rubber
room some 12 meters under the launch pad

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:44.590
and so-called because it was lined with
rubber as a shock absorber. This anti

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:51.550
chamber led via a 15 centimeter thick
steel blast door to a dome-shaped blast

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:57.190
proof room mounted on giant springs that
was designed to withstand the explosion

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:03.580
of a fully fueled saturn v on the launch
pad above. This room could hold up to 20

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:09.250
people with enough food and water and an
air filtration system for 24 hours. Each

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:14.050
of the seats could hold a fully suited
astronaut until such time it was

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:19.840
safe to leave a room via an escape
tunnel but emerged some 366 meters away

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:25.690
from the pad. Now the launch platform
under the rocket was not a flat surface

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:32.080
it had a 13.7 meter
square blast shielded hole for the

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:37.510
rocket exhaust which allowed it to pass
down and over the flame deflector. This

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:42.460
double-sided ramp was there to deflect
the exhaust and stop it from coming back

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:48.370
up and enveloping the rocket. The 13
meter high ramp which was covered in

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:52.170
flames probe concrete and mounted on
rails so could be more easily replaced,

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:57.880
deflected the exhaust down to 18 meter
wide flame trenches which stretched a

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.710
174 meters and were
also made from concrete and lined with

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:08.620
refractory bricks to protect it from a
heat. The huge amount of smoke seen at the

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:13.300
launch isn't just rocket exhaust, it's
mostly water from the deluge system

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:18.820
flashing to steam from the heat of the
exhaust. The water was pumped onto the

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:23.830
launch pad just before takeoff to help
protect the platform and act as an

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:30.550
acoustic dampener. In 1974 launch pad 39a was decommissioned and was reconfigured

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:36.970
for the space shuttle the same also
happened to pad 39b in 1977. The reason for

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:42.040
the three-year gap was just in case
Congress changed its mind and decided to

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:48.750
reinstate the Apollo program. Pad 39B
wouldn't be used for the shuttle until

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:57.220
1986 when its first mission was for the
ill-fated Challenger STS-51. After the

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:01.540
Apollo missions the mobile launcher
platforms were also redesigned for the

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:06.880
shuttles. The launch umbilical Tower was
removed and a permanent two-piece access

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:12.040
tower system the fixed service structure
the FSS and the rotating service

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:18.340
structure the RSS were built at the
launch pad 39A and B. This new structure

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:23.590
also replaced the old mobile service
structure. Some of the old structures

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:29.620
were preserved in particular the white
room from launch pad 39a which is now at

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:36.190
the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Center.
Now just the shuttle stack, that's the

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:40.680
shuttle, the SRBs and the external fuel
tank would be carried on

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:45.810
launcher platform. The platform was also
modified for the solid rocket boosters

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:51.000
and the exhaust bays were expanded and
the flame deflectors were also replaced.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.500
As the shuttle was being tested it
became clear that huge acoustic

00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:00.360
shockwaves were bouncing off the launch
platform and could endanger both crew

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:05.610
and the delicate insulation tiles of the
shuttle. This also occurred during the

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:10.860
Apollo launches too but the Saturn was
also much higher up and further away

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.820
from the engines and the Saturn didn't
have any delicate heat-resistant tiles

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:22.380
either. So a new expanded deluge system
was also added. This was supplied by a 90

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:27.870
meter high water tower which held 1.1
million litres of water and ran through

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:34.110
twin 2 meter wide pipes  to 16 nozzles that
sprayed the water over the launch

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:39.149
platform onto the flame deflector. The
deluge system will be activated six

00:14:39.149 --> 00:14:44.880
seconds prior to liftoff would emptied the
1.1 million liters of water in around 41

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:50.339
seconds and reduced for sound level by
half to about a 142db.

00:14:50.339 --> 00:14:55.980
With these massive metal
structures like the Apollo launch tower

00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:00.660
and the Saturn rocket itself there was
the ever-present danger of lightning

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:05.700
strikes hitting a fully fueled rocket or
causing electronic failures. To mitigate

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:10.200
against this the apollo launch tower used a lightning conductor on the top of

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:15.630
the tower. This provided a cone of
protection for the vehicle and the

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:20.520
equipment within it but the Lightning
could be still quite close to sensitive

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:25.500
electronics. When the shuttle came into
service the electronics had shrunk in size

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:30.870
but also became more sensitive so the
Lightning conductor was attached to two

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:36.870
catenary wires to direct the electrical
discharge further away. For the now

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:41.760
canceled constellation program it was
upgraded once more to the "rolling

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:48.660
spheres" system. Here three 150 meter
towers are topped with 17 meter

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:52.440
fiberglass insulators and linked
together with multiple

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:57.810
catenary wires around the launchpad
which keeps the lightning much further

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:03.420
away. After the cancellation of a
constellation program in 2010 and the

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:09.630
final flight of a space shuttle in 2011
the future of Launchpad complex 39 was

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:16.950
in doubt. So in 2013 NASA allowed bidding
for the first commercial flights from

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:24.090
pad 39a and a 20-year lease was awarded
to SpaceX for the exclusive use of a

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:28.080
launch pad.
Unlike Apollo and shuttle SpaceX Rockets

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:33.510
were built horizontally and then lifted
up at the launch pad so a new horizontal

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:40.530
integration facility was built at pad
39A. Pad 39B will be used for the SLS

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:45.150
system and that will use the same
vertical integration method first used

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:50.070
in the Saturn V and when it's not in use
for the SLS, 39b

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:56.450
will be available for other commercial
launches. In 2015 a new launch pad called

00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:02.010
39C was built and that's for use with
smaller launch vehicles. They're also

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:08.310
plans for two more launch complexes LC
48 and LC 49 as the market for

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:13.230
commercial space increases and for use
with other rockets like the Blue Origin

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:18.329
new Glen. So what's your thoughts about
America's gateway to space

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:21.930
maybe you've worked there or maybe
witnessed some of the launches, let me
