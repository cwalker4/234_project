00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.367
Let me ask you this,

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.770
as someone who's running
to be president,

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:06.105
one thing I've always enjoyed
about watching you is,

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:07.907
you know, like, in hearings,
you're focused,

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.509
you-you know what you want
to talk about,

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.511
you know what the issues are,
but, at the same time,

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:14.313
you, you know-- you have
a light side to you as well.

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:16.716
Are you ready for how frivolous

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:19.052
some of the campaign trail
is going to be?

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:20.720
Like, I mean, you've seen
how people are asking

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:23.256
-if people know how to eat
fried chicken properly -I know.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.725
and, um,
do people know how to eat corn.

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:27.860
-And, like, are-are you ready
for that part? -I know.

00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:29.028
-Do you think people still like
that... -It's already happened,

00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:30.363
-Trevor. It already happened.
-Yeah?

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:32.832 line:0%
So, I was in, um,
South Carolina recently.

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:35.435 line:0%
-Right. -And, uh,
I'm gonna tell you, you know,

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:36.969 line:0%
one of the things--
I will say this--

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:38.971 line:0%
that I love about campaigning,

00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:42.175 line:0%
um, you meet the angels
walking among us.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:45.178
You meet people
you otherwise may never meet

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:48.448
who are doing incredible work
in their communities,

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:51.451
love their communities, are-are
leaders in their communities

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:54.387
without any requirement
that people applaud them

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.522
or pay attention to them.
They're just doing great work.

00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:58.524
And I love that
about campaigning.

00:00:58.557 --> 00:01:02.061
-On the other side of it...
-(laughter)

00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:03.596
So, I'm in South Carolina.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.131
Okay, so, first of all,
let me just say,

00:01:05.164 --> 00:01:07.066
I've never run for president
of the United States before,

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:08.534
-so it's a new experience.
-Right.

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:10.870
And-and part
of the new experience is

00:01:10.903 --> 00:01:12.205
all these people will follow

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.207
-when you go somewhere
just to eat. -Yes.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.742
And, like, when I go somewhere
to eat, it's 'cause I'm hungry

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:18.945
and I really want
to be able to eat.

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:20.213
And, you know,
when you have been working

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.547
-for a long period of time
-Yes.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.882
-and you're really hungry,
-Yes.

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:24.417
you can get kind of primal.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.619
(laughing)

00:01:26.652 --> 00:01:29.455
Like, "Everybody back
the you-know-what off!

00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:31.190
I'm hungry!"

00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:34.260
And-and so I go into this place,

00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:36.395
and it's--
Rodney Scott is his name,

00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:37.930
and he's got--
in South Carolina.

00:01:37.963 --> 00:01:40.199
So, South Carolina has got
different kinds of regions,

00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:43.669
and, based on the region,
the barbecue sauce is different.

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:45.538
-Oh, okay, I didn't know that.
-Oh, vinegar-based

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:47.807
-versus, like, tomato base
versus mustard base. -Right.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.009
Okay, so his is vinegar-based,
and his--

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:52.278
and his restaurant is just--
the food is amazing.

00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:53.880
So, I'm standing in line,

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:56.549
and there's, like,
all this press over there.

00:01:56.582 --> 00:02:00.052
And I can hear this whispering
by some of the press.

00:02:00.085 --> 00:02:02.922
"What's she gonna order?
What's she gonna order?

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:05.858
Did she order meat or did
she just order, like, a salad?"

00:02:05.891 --> 00:02:07.994
Right? And I'm like,
"Are you kidding me?"

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:09.328
First of all,

00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:11.497
why would that be a debatable

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.900
-or even a-a subject
of discussion, -Right, right.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:16.235
when we are dealing
with mass iss--

00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:18.037
like, massive issues
in our country?

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.773
We're dealing with issues
of massive inequality.

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:22.441
We are dealing with the concern

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:24.977
that we've got a president
embarrassing us in Munich.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.979
We've got so many things
to talk about.

00:02:27.012 --> 00:02:29.048
Yes, but did you order the--
did you order the...

00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:31.184
Pulled pork, man!
I had pulled pork!

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:33.786
(laughter)

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.289
-Are you kidding me?!
-We want to know!

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:39.225
-It-it really... -'Cause
that's what I felt like eating!

00:02:39.258 --> 00:02:40.893
Right. It really is interesting.
You know--

00:02:40.926 --> 00:02:42.161
you know what's interesting?
And this is--

00:02:42.194 --> 00:02:43.496
this is
what's gonna be tough for you

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:45.097
and every other
Democratic candidate

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.300
is that you do realize
that you're going to be held

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:48.768
to different standards
than Donald Trump.

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:51.370
Because what people consider
a scandal for him

00:02:51.403 --> 00:02:53.706
has now-- it has to be
the utmost degree.

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.175
I mean, he can basically
threaten someone on Twitter,

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:58.444
and people are like, "That's the
president being the president."

00:02:58.477 --> 00:03:00.112
But if you order salad

00:03:00.145 --> 00:03:02.181
when you should order
pulled pork,

00:03:02.214 --> 00:03:04.517
-people are coming for you.
-This is my-- this is my point.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.852
So then-- okay, I'm gonna--
It goes on.

00:03:06.885 --> 00:03:08.588
So, in the same trip, then--

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.257
-So, I-I care a lot
about small businesses. -Right.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.059
And, in fact,
that's part of my agenda

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:16.195
about what we should do
to actually give more federal,

00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:18.798
um, incentives
for-for small businesses

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.800
for-for investment and growth.

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:22.668
-(cheering and applause)
-So-- Okay.

00:03:22.701 --> 00:03:24.003
For so many reasons,

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:27.173
including that,
when you look at a path

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:29.008
towards financial health
and success,

00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:31.744
when you look at how
small businesses run themselves

00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:33.813
in a way that it's not just
about running the business

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:35.481
but being a member
of the community,

00:03:35.514 --> 00:03:37.416
small business leaders
are also civic leaders,

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.085
they're community leaders,
okay, on and on.

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:42.421
So I'm visiting small businesses
on a street called Lady Street,

00:03:42.454 --> 00:03:44.757
which, by the way,
on Lady Street,

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.627
all but one of
the business owners is a woman.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.895
-Wow. -It's--
Yeah, it's really fantastic.

00:03:49.928 --> 00:03:51.364
So, I'm visiting this one

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:54.233
where the woman
who runs the-the salon,

00:03:54.266 --> 00:03:56.902
um, Naida, Styled by Naida,

00:03:56.935 --> 00:04:00.106
she was formerly in foster care,

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.641
she was homeless,

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:03.576
she put herself through school.

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.113
She had never worn any clothes
for her--

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:10.316
almost her entire life
that was firsthand.

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.184
-All secondhand.
-Right.

00:04:12.217 --> 00:04:15.187
So she decided
to start this vintage store

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.657
where the proceeds of her sales

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.527
go to helping women who have--
who have--

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.129
-don't have clothes. So,
for example, -That's amazing.

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:25.731
for the local college,
she gives clothes to women

00:04:25.764 --> 00:04:28.200
who are going for interviews
and job interviews and going--

00:04:28.233 --> 00:04:29.602
Just incredible work.

00:04:29.635 --> 00:04:32.872
So, I'm in the store,
and I'm hearing her story.

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:34.874
And then, you know,
I want to buy something.

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:37.543
And so then I look at this...
(chuckles)

00:04:37.576 --> 00:04:39.812
multicolored sequins jacket.

00:04:39.845 --> 00:04:41.781
(laughing)

00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:46.752
And I'm thinking
this would be really great

00:04:46.785 --> 00:04:48.621
-for Pride Parade, right?
-Right. Right.

00:04:48.654 --> 00:04:50.122
(laughs):
So...

00:04:50.155 --> 00:04:52.058
And I try it on.

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:53.592
And then that's it, and I leave.

00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:55.127
And I-- and I was
in South Carolina.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.130
Then I-I fly back, and I get
home and my husband's like,

00:04:58.163 --> 00:04:59.932
"Do you know--"
'cause he wasn't with me--

00:04:59.965 --> 00:05:01.667
He's like,
"So, there's this jacket

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.402
"that apparently you tried on.

00:05:03.435 --> 00:05:06.005
It's-it's now got its own life."

00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:08.541
And, like, apparently,
it became the subject

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:10.810
of all this controversy
by journalists

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:14.547
around should she be doing
something like shopping

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.082
if she's running for president

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:17.750
-and then all this other--
-Right.

00:05:17.783 --> 00:05:20.720
-And just ridiculous, right?
It's ridiculous. -It's-it's--

00:05:20.753 --> 00:05:22.855
It really is an interesting
journey to be on

00:05:22.888 --> 00:05:24.423
when-when you have policy ideas,

00:05:24.456 --> 00:05:27.259
and people are looking into the
small... like, the frivolous.

00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:29.028
As you say, I mean, you're
visiting a business owner,

00:05:29.061 --> 00:05:31.297
and people go like,
"Should you be shopping or not?"

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.432
Like, when the... and the story
should be about the need

00:05:33.465 --> 00:05:35.201
-for small businesses in America
-Right.

00:05:35.234 --> 00:05:36.836
...to receive the support
that they deserve,

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:40.106
understanding that that is
a path to economic growth

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.074
-and opportunity for so many
community... -But the story...

00:05:42.107 --> 00:05:43.275
But the story was
about the jacket.

00:05:43.308 --> 00:05:44.443
But the story was
about my multicol...

00:05:44.476 --> 00:05:45.778
I bought it, also.

00:05:45.811 --> 00:05:47.613
(laughter,
applause and cheering)

00:05:47.646 --> 00:05:49.415
I like that you finished up
the stories.

00:05:49.448 --> 00:05:50.783
That's good. That is good.

00:05:50.816 --> 00:05:52.284
Let me... let me...
let me ask you this.

00:05:52.317 --> 00:05:53.819
Let me... let me ask you
a few things.

00:05:53.852 --> 00:05:56.021
Um, 'cause, honestly,
I could chat to you forever.

00:05:56.054 --> 00:05:57.256
I mean, the...

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:58.824
What I'd like to know is...

00:05:58.857 --> 00:06:00.960
You-you have this vision
for America.

00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:02.461
You-you are saying
to Americans,

00:06:02.494 --> 00:06:05.364
"I want you to elect me as
president of the United States."

00:06:05.397 --> 00:06:07.633
You have had some strong words
to say

00:06:07.666 --> 00:06:11.170
-about the current president's
border wall specifically. -Yeah.

00:06:11.203 --> 00:06:13.606
Now he's pitched this
as one of the things

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.308
that is going to prevent drugs
from coming into the country,

00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:18.244
and this is going
to keep Americans safe.

00:06:18.277 --> 00:06:20.079
You have said,
"No, this is a vanity project."

00:06:20.112 --> 00:06:22.915
Why do you say that, and why
do you think it will not help?

00:06:22.948 --> 00:06:26.218
Okay, so, as we have discussed,

00:06:26.251 --> 00:06:28.320
I had a career as a prosecutor.

00:06:28.353 --> 00:06:29.789
That included prosecuting

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:31.891
-transnational criminal
organizations. -Mm-hmm.

00:06:31.924 --> 00:06:34.260
I have gone to the border.

00:06:34.293 --> 00:06:37.663
I have personally seen
the tunnels.

00:06:37.696 --> 00:06:40.032
I have seen photographs
of tunnels

00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:42.601
-between Mexico
and the United States... -Right.

00:06:42.634 --> 00:06:45.237
that were literally as smooth
as the walls in this studio.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.572
Right. We've got smooth walls.

00:06:46.605 --> 00:06:49.041
-Lined with air conditioning
and lighting. -Right.

00:06:49.074 --> 00:06:52.978
And the point being
that these were built

00:06:53.011 --> 00:06:55.481
because people are making
a whole lot of money

00:06:55.514 --> 00:06:57.917
-in the trafficking of guns,
drugs and human beings. -Uh-huh.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.052
That wall ain't gonna stop them.

00:07:00.085 --> 00:07:03.689
This is about tunnels,
it's about ports of entry.

00:07:03.722 --> 00:07:06.625
-He has created a fiction,
and-and... -But-but...

00:07:06.658 --> 00:07:08.561
-You watch
the State of the Union. -Uh-huh.

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:13.232
Because the narrative, right,
the yarn that he is pulling

00:07:13.265 --> 00:07:15.000
suggests that there is some link

00:07:15.033 --> 00:07:18.204
between transnational
criminal activity

00:07:18.237 --> 00:07:22.174
and these children crossing
the border with their parents,

00:07:22.207 --> 00:07:24.343
fleeing murder capitals
of the world,

00:07:24.376 --> 00:07:26.479
seeking asylum in the country

00:07:26.512 --> 00:07:29.815
-that has always proudly
held itself out to be... -Right.

00:07:29.848 --> 00:07:31.517
(applause and cheering)

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.885
a place that will be a refuge...

00:07:32.918 --> 00:07:34.053
So...

00:07:34.086 --> 00:07:35.321
for people fleeing harm.

00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:37.323
So, that was...
that's understandable.

00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:39.625
Now what we're starting
to see is

00:07:39.658 --> 00:07:42.394
different Democratic candidates
and hopefuls coming out

00:07:42.427 --> 00:07:44.663
and saying what their opinion
or their idea

00:07:44.696 --> 00:07:47.833
-of a border enforcement,
uh, would be. -Right.

00:07:47.866 --> 00:07:49.735
-Right. -Um, Beto O'Rourke,
who I...

00:07:49.768 --> 00:07:51.670
-hasn't formerly entered
the race... -Right.

00:07:51.703 --> 00:07:53.672
has come out and said

00:07:53.705 --> 00:07:56.342
-he would remove
the existing wall. -Yeah.

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:58.277
I think there's about 700 miles
of border wall.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.912
And he said,
"Oh, I think all walls are bad,

00:07:59.945 --> 00:08:01.981
and I think all existing
barriers would be moved."

00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:03.749
Would you remove the walls
if you became president--

00:08:03.782 --> 00:08:05.084
the walls that exist now?

00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:07.453 line:0%
No, I believe that we need
border security, and

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:09.522 line:0%
but we need
smart border security.

00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:10.923 line:0%
We need to...
We-we can't...

00:08:10.956 --> 00:08:13.659 line:0%
We can't have open borders.
We need to have border security.

00:08:13.692 --> 00:08:15.327 line:0%
All nations do.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.762
All nations define
their borders.

00:08:16.795 --> 00:08:20.032
But our... We should not have
a policy and a perspective

00:08:20.065 --> 00:08:22.768
that is grounded
in keeping people out

00:08:22.801 --> 00:08:27.306
for the sake of-of this
nationalistic kind of thing

00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:29.475
that this president is trying
to push.

00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:33.646
We should have borders that also
allow people to come in.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.781
That is part of the strength
of our nation.

00:08:35.814 --> 00:08:39.151
We are nation that was founded
and-and has grown

00:08:39.184 --> 00:08:41.053
because we have always
welcomed immigrants.

00:08:41.086 --> 00:08:42.821
-We are a nation of immigrants.
Look. -But Trump is saying...

00:08:42.854 --> 00:08:44.823
-But Trump is saying...
-If you are not Native American,

00:08:44.856 --> 00:08:46.225
-your people are immigrants.
-Right. No, that's true.

00:08:46.258 --> 00:08:47.793
-(applause and cheering)
-But-but Trump is saying...

00:08:47.826 --> 00:08:49.528
Well, except for those...
except for those...

00:08:49.561 --> 00:08:51.397
except for those
who were kidnapped

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.432
-and brought over
on a slave ship. -Right.

00:08:53.465 --> 00:08:56.302
-(applause) -Right,
but-but Trump is arguing...

00:08:56.335 --> 00:08:58.270
He's saying, as he always says,
he says,

00:08:58.303 --> 00:09:00.973
"I love immigrants
if they come in legally, folks.

00:09:01.006 --> 00:09:03.175
I just want them to come in
through the front door."

00:09:03.208 --> 00:09:05.945
That's what he says. So he's
saying, "I don't mind. I..."

00:09:05.978 --> 00:09:07.413
He's like,
"I'm with you, Kamala.

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:09.515
"I married an immigrant,
but I want...

00:09:09.548 --> 00:09:12.651
I want an immigrant to come in
through the front door."

00:09:12.684 --> 00:09:14.119
That's-that's what
his argument is.

00:09:14.152 --> 00:09:17.323
But the argument
does not hold water, Trevor,

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:20.125
because he has also not
put in place or even advocated

00:09:20.158 --> 00:09:22.361
for comprehensive
immigration reform.

00:09:22.394 --> 00:09:24.496
He has not advocated for...

00:09:24.529 --> 00:09:26.699
He has... he has shut down
the DACA system.

00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:28.100
I mean, listen,

00:09:28.133 --> 00:09:30.135
this is "Deferred Action
for Childhood Arrivals."

00:09:30.168 --> 00:09:32.705
There was a policy in place
that said,

00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:35.574
"For those children who were
brought to the United States,

00:09:35.607 --> 00:09:37.676
-some before they could walk
or talk." -Mm-hmm.

00:09:37.709 --> 00:09:41.280
They vetted, a-a system where
they had to clear a vet.

00:09:41.313 --> 00:09:42.982
Had they committed a crime? No.

00:09:43.015 --> 00:09:45.217
Were they in college?
Were they being productive? Yes.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.187
-If all of those criteria
were met... -Yes.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.389
they received protection,
which he ended.

00:09:50.422 --> 00:09:52.091
And it's only
because of the courts

00:09:52.124 --> 00:09:54.426
that those kids are not now
being deported.

00:09:54.459 --> 00:09:59.298
So, he cannot stand
on principle or American values

00:09:59.331 --> 00:10:02.534
or morals in taking the position
he has taken,

00:10:02.567 --> 00:10:05.804
because it is immoral, and it is
against American values,

00:10:05.837 --> 00:10:08.040
these positions he has taken
on immigration.

00:10:08.073 --> 00:10:09.775
Yes, we need border security.

00:10:09.808 --> 00:10:12.044
We also need comprehensive
immigration reform.

00:10:12.077 --> 00:10:13.579
We also need to protect those

00:10:13.612 --> 00:10:15.247
who are fleeing violence
and harm

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.684
by giving them an opportunity
to be heard around asylum.

00:10:18.717 --> 00:10:20.653
He's shutting that down.

00:10:20.686 --> 00:10:23.422
He's not even letting
these people walk in

00:10:23.455 --> 00:10:25.591
to have their hearing

00:10:25.624 --> 00:10:28.727
-so we can determine
the legitimacy... -Mm-hmm.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.596
of the harm
that they are fleeing.

00:10:30.629 --> 00:10:33.432
When you look at, um,

00:10:33.465 --> 00:10:35.601
the future of America then,

00:10:35.634 --> 00:10:38.303
as a presidential hopeful,

00:10:38.336 --> 00:10:41.774
you see yourself sitting
in that Oval Office,

00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:45.310
what would you like
the new message of America to be

00:10:45.343 --> 00:10:48.447
if there were
a post Trump presidency?

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.949
-Which there will be. Uh-huh.
-Well, if we survive.

00:10:50.982 --> 00:10:52.951
(applause and cheering)

00:10:52.984 --> 00:10:54.586
It's not the apocalypse.

00:10:54.619 --> 00:10:56.555
(both laugh)

00:10:56.588 --> 00:11:00.859
Yet. Um, the message has to be
that we are a nation

00:11:00.892 --> 00:11:04.229
that values truth and justice.

00:11:04.262 --> 00:11:06.231
The message has to be

00:11:06.264 --> 00:11:08.467
that we will continue to be

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.169
what, by nature,
we have always been,

00:11:10.202 --> 00:11:11.937
which is a source
of our strength,

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.806
-which is
an aspirational nation. -Mm-hmm.

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:16.408
We were founded on noble ideals.

00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:17.976
The ideals that were present

00:11:18.009 --> 00:11:19.812
when we wrote the Constitution
of the United States

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:21.980
and all of its amendments
and the Bill of Rights

00:11:22.013 --> 00:11:23.348
and the Declaration
of Independence,

00:11:23.381 --> 00:11:24.650
and said we are all equal,

00:11:24.683 --> 00:11:27.553
and should be treated that way
back in 1776.

00:11:27.586 --> 00:11:29.288
We are an aspirational nation.

00:11:29.321 --> 00:11:31.690
We have always fought
to reach those ideals.

00:11:31.723 --> 00:11:33.158
Now, let's be clear-eyed.

00:11:33.191 --> 00:11:36.128
-We've never quite reached
those ideals. -Right.

00:11:36.161 --> 00:11:39.498
But part of our strength is
we fight to reach those ideals.

00:11:39.531 --> 00:11:42.167
And as president
of the United States,

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.003
I would hold true
to keep fighting,

00:11:45.036 --> 00:11:48.373
understanding who we can be
unburdened who we have been.

00:11:48.406 --> 00:11:50.909
But we have to have leadership
in this country

00:11:50.942 --> 00:11:53.445
that values the integrity
of public service

00:11:53.478 --> 00:11:56.281
and the value
of leadership understanding

00:11:56.314 --> 00:11:59.718
that it is not
about self-service.

00:11:59.751 --> 00:12:01.920
It should be
about service of others.

00:12:01.953 --> 00:12:05.090
It's about integrity,
and it's about the public trust.

00:12:05.123 --> 00:12:07.326
We don't have that right now.

00:12:07.359 --> 00:12:09.027
(cheering, applause)

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.996
Let's talk about your plans.

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:15.634
I mean, one thing I hope, uh...

00:12:15.667 --> 00:12:17.569
doesn't happen
on the campaign trail

00:12:17.602 --> 00:12:20.472
is that the Democratic race
becomes only about Trump.

00:12:20.505 --> 00:12:22.074
And that was something
that was frustrating

00:12:22.107 --> 00:12:23.509
in the previous race.

00:12:23.542 --> 00:12:26.378
And one thing I think a lot of
people are excited to hear about

00:12:26.411 --> 00:12:27.713
is your plans.

00:12:27.746 --> 00:12:30.015
-Yeah. -One of the things
you talk about in the book

00:12:30.048 --> 00:12:34.353
and you have laid out is a giant
boost for middle-class families

00:12:34.386 --> 00:12:36.355
in America,
giving them tax cuts

00:12:36.388 --> 00:12:38.357
and getting them
to where they need to be.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.993
You've also talked about...
doing it in a very specific way,

00:12:41.026 --> 00:12:43.162
where people would be able
to get that money,

00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:44.930
uh, smaller increments
as opposed to getting

00:12:44.963 --> 00:12:47.099
one lump sum
at the end of the year,

00:12:47.132 --> 00:12:48.400
which more families
may appreciate.

00:12:48.433 --> 00:12:50.502
What is that about,
and how did you come to that?

00:12:50.535 --> 00:12:54.673
I'm very excited about it,
and if elected, when elected...

00:12:54.706 --> 00:12:58.844
-(applause) -um, it would be one
of my first orders of business.

00:12:58.877 --> 00:13:02.915 line:0%
And this is, what I am proposing
is that we change the tax code

00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:06.285 line:0%
in a way that benefits
and lifts up working families

00:13:06.318 --> 00:13:07.853 line:0%
and middle-class families.

00:13:07.886 --> 00:13:09.721 line:0%
So, here is the facts.

00:13:09.754 --> 00:13:11.523
Almost half of American families

00:13:11.556 --> 00:13:14.693
are a $400
unexpected emergency away

00:13:14.726 --> 00:13:16.962
from really being toppled,

00:13:16.995 --> 00:13:18.997
in terms of their
financial well-being.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.166
Um, the reality in America today

00:13:21.199 --> 00:13:23.936
is that 99% of the counties
in the United States,

00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:27.072
in 99% of those counties,
if you're a minimum-wage worker

00:13:27.105 --> 00:13:29.608
working full-time,
you cannot afford market rate

00:13:29.641 --> 00:13:31.176
on a one-bedroom apartment.

00:13:31.209 --> 00:13:33.512
These are the realities
in America today.

00:13:33.545 --> 00:13:36.481
The reality in America today
is that we are not starting out

00:13:36.514 --> 00:13:38.951
on an even playing field,
not everyone has equal access

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:42.120
to a path to success, and
so we have to correct course.

00:13:42.153 --> 00:13:44.957
I propose we lift up those
middle-class working families.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:48.160
So my specific proposal is that,
for families that are making

00:13:48.193 --> 00:13:50.395
less than a hundred thousand
dollars a year,

00:13:50.428 --> 00:13:52.865
they receive a tax credit
that they can collect

00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:54.833
at $500 a month.

00:13:54.866 --> 00:13:57.803
Understanding that is the...
that is the difference

00:13:57.836 --> 00:14:00.973
between being able to make it

00:14:01.006 --> 00:14:05.043
or-or literally facing
disruption and real upheaval.

00:14:05.076 --> 00:14:07.546
Because we're talking
about the unexpected expense

00:14:07.579 --> 00:14:09.848
around getting the car repaired.

00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:12.784
We're looking at the fact that
one in four people in America

00:14:12.817 --> 00:14:15.053
who have diabetes
cannot afford their insulin.

00:14:15.086 --> 00:14:17.089
And so it's the difference
between being able

00:14:17.122 --> 00:14:18.757
to pay for your
medication or not.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.926
And don't get me started
on the pharmaceutical companies.

00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:23.395
-Oh, we will soon.
We will soon. -Yeah. Right.

00:14:23.428 --> 00:14:25.898
Um, and it is
about also understanding

00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:29.368
that we have to lift up
the middle and working classes

00:14:29.401 --> 00:14:32.938
of this country, and understand
that the rules have been written

00:14:32.971 --> 00:14:34.640
in a way that it excluded them.

00:14:34.673 --> 00:14:37.342
We... He just passed a tax bill

00:14:37.375 --> 00:14:40.946
that benefits the top one
percent and big corporations.

00:14:40.979 --> 00:14:44.049
They don't need that money.
They don't need that money.

00:14:44.082 --> 00:14:46.652
And-and we have got
to correct the course

00:14:46.685 --> 00:14:49.021
in a way that understands
that working families

00:14:49.054 --> 00:14:51.990
are the heart and soul
and the strength of our nation,

00:14:52.023 --> 00:14:55.360
and we have got to lift them up,
and we've got to support them.

00:14:55.393 --> 00:14:58.530
And my proposal is actually,
by economists,

00:14:58.563 --> 00:15:00.632
has been described
as what would be

00:15:00.665 --> 00:15:02.801
 the most significant
tax benefit

00:15:02.834 --> 00:15:05.003
for middle-class families
in generations.

00:15:05.036 --> 00:15:07.572
-(applause) -It really
has been lauded by many.

00:15:07.605 --> 00:15:09.474
Mm-hmm.

00:15:09.507 --> 00:15:10.809
Let's...

00:15:10.842 --> 00:15:14.079
let's talk not about the
pharmaceutical companies per se,

00:15:14.112 --> 00:15:19.051
but about... your plans
for Americans in a few areas.

00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:22.354
You've come out and you've said,
"Unlike Bernie Sanders

00:15:22.387 --> 00:15:25.190
and Ocasio-Cortez," you said,
"Yes, I'm a Democrat,

00:15:25.223 --> 00:15:26.925
but I'm not
a Democratic-Socialist."

00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.127
But you-you
have come out and said

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.530
that you propose
Medicare for all.

00:15:31.563 --> 00:15:34.166
-Yes. -You've said that you
believe that there should be,

00:15:34.199 --> 00:15:35.634
uh, debt-free student loans.

00:15:35.667 --> 00:15:38.503
You know, people should be able
to study without being in debt.

00:15:38.536 --> 00:15:41.940
-I do. -You've come out with
many proposals that are similar

00:15:41.973 --> 00:15:44.009
to what somebody like
Bernie Sanders would say,

00:15:44.042 --> 00:15:45.677
and then, obviously,
many of your own.

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.280
What do you think
separates you from them, then?

00:15:48.313 --> 00:15:51.183
Well, I will say
what I feel very strongly.

00:15:51.216 --> 00:15:54.286
I feel very strongly that we,
um, need to have a system

00:15:54.319 --> 00:15:57.289
in this place where everybody
has equal access to success.

00:15:57.322 --> 00:16:00.559
And we can do that in a way that
is about lifting people up.

00:16:00.592 --> 00:16:03.295
We can do it in a way
that is about recognizing

00:16:03.328 --> 00:16:05.330
that all people
also want a system

00:16:05.363 --> 00:16:06.898
where there's gonna be
a fair market

00:16:06.931 --> 00:16:08.500
and there is
gonna be competition,

00:16:08.533 --> 00:16:10.802
but let's not be lulled
into believing right now

00:16:10.835 --> 00:16:13.905
that everyone has equal access,
that we start on the same base,

00:16:13.938 --> 00:16:15.040
-Right.
-'cause we don't.

00:16:15.073 --> 00:16:16.408
And so that's got
to be corrected,

00:16:16.441 --> 00:16:18.677
and it can be corrected,
but it's gonna have to be

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.412
about a number of things,
including the way

00:16:20.445 --> 00:16:21.680
that we tax people

00:16:21.713 --> 00:16:23.849
and the way that we
are distributing benefits.

00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:26.018
Let's look at it
from another example,

00:16:26.051 --> 00:16:28.220
which is the public education
system of our country.

00:16:28.253 --> 00:16:30.889
Everybody's not starting out
on the same base,

00:16:30.922 --> 00:16:32.991
in the same place.
And we are a society--

00:16:33.024 --> 00:16:35.994
and this is where we have
to speak truth also, Trevor--

00:16:36.027 --> 00:16:38.964
we are a society that pretends
to care about education.

00:16:38.997 --> 00:16:40.532
Well, guess what?

00:16:40.565 --> 00:16:43.235
Not so much the education
of other people's children.

00:16:43.268 --> 00:16:44.703
Let's be honest about that.

00:16:44.736 --> 00:16:47.639
Because if we did care about
that, we would not have allowed

00:16:47.672 --> 00:16:49.307
the public education system
in America

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.309
to deteriorate
in the way it has,

00:16:51.342 --> 00:16:54.112
because we are not paying
teachers their value,

00:16:54.145 --> 00:16:56.248
-(applause)
-we are not putting resources

00:16:56.281 --> 00:16:58.583
into our schools.

00:16:58.616 --> 00:17:01.753
I have met more teachers
than I care to tell you

00:17:01.786 --> 00:17:04.056
who are working two jobs,
sometimes three,

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:05.857
to put food on the table,

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.527
and because also they're
coming out of their own pockets

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.529
to buy school supplies
for their students.

00:17:10.562 --> 00:17:12.998
We are a society
that is not paying people

00:17:13.031 --> 00:17:15.333
-the value of their labor
and of their work. -Right.

00:17:15.366 --> 00:17:17.569
And these are the things
that have to be adjusted.

00:17:17.602 --> 00:17:19.704
You don't have to be
a socialist to believe

00:17:19.737 --> 00:17:21.706
everyone should have
equal opportunities

00:17:21.739 --> 00:17:23.742
on a path to success.

00:17:23.775 --> 00:17:25.377
Wow. It's...

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:28.980
-(applause) -it's gonna be
a crazy journey for you.

00:17:29.013 --> 00:17:30.649
It's gonna be exciting.

00:17:30.682 --> 00:17:32.317
The book, I really recommend

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.854
to anyone who wants to get to
know the person behind the name.

00:17:35.887 --> 00:17:38.290
And you also have a
children's book which is called

00:17:38.323 --> 00:17:39.591
 Superheroes Are Everywhere.

00:17:39.624 --> 00:17:41.593
It's really fun illustrations,

00:17:41.626 --> 00:17:44.196
and it's inspirational stories
for kids out there.

00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:45.797
 The Truths We Hold 
and Superheroes

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.466
are available everywhere now.

00:17:47.499 --> 00:17:49.501
Senator Kamala Harris,
everybody.
