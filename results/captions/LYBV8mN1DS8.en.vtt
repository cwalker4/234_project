00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:06.240
From the steps taken to secure each flight
to the incredible, high-tech features aboard

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:20.800
each deck, today we take a look at some AMAZING
Things About Air Force One.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.380
Number 10.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.429
Presidential Symbol
Iconically recognizable by its distinct shades

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:31.869
of blue and the presidential seal emblazoned
on its side, Air Force One is one of the major

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.970
symbols of the United States presidency.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.720
At the size of a six story building, the jumbo
jet stands tall and proud to U.S. allies while

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.040
maintaining an intimidating presence to would-be
enemies.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.330
The brilliant blue across the top and more
delicate shade of baby blue lining the underbelly

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.710
of the plane come from a design inspired by
first lady Jackie Kennedy as the latter color

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.990
was a favorite of her husband, former president
John F. Kennedy.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.620
This traditional color scheme has persisted
into the modern age, but current president

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.810
Donald Trump has stated that, with a new set
of Air Force One jets in the works, he believes

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.620
this should be changed to red, white, and
blue and intends to do so.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.950
Number 9.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.500
Overdue Upgrade
For over half a century, the aircraft corporation

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.220
Boeing has been the sole provider for all
of the head of state's air transportation

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.220
needs.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.670
Originally initiated with the first overseas
presidential flight taken by Franklin Roosevelt

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.810
in 1943 to Casablanca, the Boeing B-314 "Dixie
Clipper" is considered to be history's introduction

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.700
to Air Force One.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.260
In the late 1950s, the company built the first
plane dedicated to serving the commander-in-chief

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.030
with the development of the Boeing VC-137A.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.530
It debuted under the term of Dwight Eisenhower
with a 19-day maiden voyage across 11 nations.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.800
Currently, the pair of jets serving as Air
Force One are extremely customized Boeing

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.300
747-200B models and were purchased under the
Reagan administration.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.200
With production of the plane long since ended,
the need for new presidential planes has only

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.519
gotten more serious with each new presidency.

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:19.120
And so, under the Obama administration, two
Boeing 747-8 models were commissioned to be

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.879
converted to airbound presidential command
centers.

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:27.579
Since taking office, though, President Trump
has made numerous modifications to this order,

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:33.580
claiming to try to lower costs, and the total
price and completion date have yet to be seen.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.129
Number 8.

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.980
Military Op
Getting around can be a hassle for most people

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.340
in congested cities, but the President of
the United States takes it to another level.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.310
Upon leaving the White House, a helicopter
will transport the head of state about 13

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.109
miles away to Andrews Air Force Base.

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:55.900
Once aboard Air Force One, the plane is equipped
with anti-missile flares and hidden electronic

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.769
jammers for added defenses.

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.159
The heavily shielded paneling of the jet,
along with hundreds of miles of wiring, also

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:09.590
protect Air Force One from an electromagnetic
pulse, the common result of a nuclear explosion.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.409
Everything that occurs aboard the plane is
considered confidential information as an

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.319
extra measure in guarding the secrets of the
flying safehouse.

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.819
Steps are even taken to send the presidential
motorcade ahead of Air Force One in a cargo

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.879
plane so that the head of state isn't left
without protected ground transportation once

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.590
arriving to their destination.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.610
Number 7.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.139
Mobile Command Center
While typically built as modified versions

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:40.590
of pre-existing jumbo jets, Air Force One
is essentially a three-story, flying Oval

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.720
Office.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.959
Composed of more than 4,000 square feet of
floor space, the interior of the aircraft

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:51.510
has numerous rooms to fully accommodate the
needs of the president and his administration.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.189
This includes offices, a conference room,
living quarters, gym, two galleys for food

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.370
preparation, a doctor's office staffed by
medical personnel, and a kitchen that can

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.379
feed up to 100 people! Luckily it rarely houses
that many people as the plane usually carries

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:11.760
about 70 passengers comfortably along with
26 members of the flight crew.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.299
Electronic capabilities aboard the flight
are also of the highest caliber with 85 onboard

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.180
telephones, 19 televisions, and numerous two-way
radios, computers and fax machines.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.949
This way the president and his staff are always
aware of new developments on the ground level,

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.419
as well as able to keep up with the workload
typical of a nation's leader.

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:32.910
Number 6.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.289
Massive Cost
Creating a presidential headquarters capable

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:41.500
of touring the world by air and still maintaining
the day-to-day work schedule the commander-in-chief

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.570
requires may be a cool feat, but it certainly
isn't cheap.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.060
During the Obama administration the cost per
hour of flight was calculated to be more than

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.330
two hundred thousand dollars!

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.949
Now looking to replace the current crop of
jets that are nearly two decades old, estimates

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:03.500
for the new Boeing 747-8 planes range from
3.9 to 5.3 billion dollars.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.419
Attempts by the current administration to
cut costs have brought recent calculations

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.660
closer to the 3.9 billion dollar mark, but
at the end of the day, the cost for the Air

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.970
Force One program is still only a drop in
the bucket for the massive 8.1 trillion dollar

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.680
defense budget of the United States.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.010
Number 5.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.289
Fully Staffed
In addition to its electronic, military, and

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:32.669
operational preparedness, Air Force One is
also fully loaded with an excellent staff.

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.320
Members of the Air Force One staff must first
pass intense scrutiny and a rigorous screening

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.409
process before being hired on to serve the
president and his guest passengers.

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:47.120
Hired staff are pretty much exclusively composed
of applicants with exceptional records of

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.990
military service.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.930
Even more heavily screened, though, is the
food purchased for Air Force One.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.789
Markets are chosen at random and often located
a good distance from the plane, and personnel

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:02.020
charged with securing the supplies must operate
undercover.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.569
This ensures each meal aboard the plane is
free of foreign contaminants.

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:11.300
This service staff belongs to an organization
known as the Presidential Airlift Group and

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.960
they operate as part of the White House Military
Office.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.460
Though they always maintain a sense of professionalism,
ties between the president, the secretaries

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.050
and members of his administration that travel
with him, and the Air Force One service staff

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.770
typically strengthen throughout the presidency.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:32.069
Trust and fondness have a history of blossoming
in this scenario due to the 24-hour first

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:36.750
class service they provide, especially in
such a sensitive environment.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:41.129
As such, the final flight of the head of state's
term in office rides a bit more like an emotional

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:46.660
rollercoaster than one of the safest, most
advanced aircrafts known to man.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.979
Number 4.

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:51.659
Flight Features
Often considered an airborne White House of

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:57.400
sorts, Air Force One is capable of playing
that role for days, weeks, and possibly longer

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.370
thanks to some of its excellent required features.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.509
Theoretically possessing an unlimited range
of flight, the presidential aircraft is equipped

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:10.780
with mid-flight refueling technology, allowing
Air Force One to gas up without ever having

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.360
to touch ground!

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.449
A special fuel cap on the nose of the plane
allows the fuel jet to fly ahead of the plane

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:20.740
and pump the gas while thousands of feet in
the air.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.680
This function was featured heavily in the
1997 film named after the subject of this

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:31.310
video starring Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman,
giving audiences an in-depth reenactment of

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.440
the process.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:37.270
In a controversial decision, though, President
Trump has removed this emergency feature to

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:42.940
cut costs for the upcoming 707-8 amid some
protests from Congress.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:47.639
In total, Air Force One can carry over 200
thousand litres of fuel which can propel the

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:52.080
jet up to a top speed of about 630 miles per
hour.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.080
So while it is prepared for long, enduring
tours, Air Force One is also adept at completing

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.210
much speedier trips.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:04.759
Capable of cruising at 45,000 feet, or more
than 8 miles above ground, these Boeing planes

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:09.909
soar over normal commercial flights which
typically only fly at about two-thirds of

00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:10.990
that height.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:16.279
This makes it even easier to avoid any potential
interference when combined with its radar-repelling

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:17.279
technology.

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:22.430
Thus, not only can Air Force One make both
long tours and quick journeys, but it can

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.819
do so in secrecy as well!

00:08:24.819 --> 00:08:25.819
Number 3.

00:08:25.819 --> 00:08:29.650
Call Sign
While the fully kitted pair of Boeing 747-200

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:34.850
series jets used today are certainly deserving
of the Air Force One moniker, technically

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.390
speaking, they're not the only planes that
can act as such.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:43.200
In fact, any U.S. Air Force aircraft in which
the president is a passenger becomes Air Force

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.100
One as far as the military is concerned.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:51.230
Similarly, any Navy, Army, or Marine aircraft
carrying the president are respectively known

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.620
as Navy One, Army One, and Marine One.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:59.530
There has only ever been one Navy One recorded
in history, as former president George W.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:06.270
Bush rode in a Lockheed S-3 Viking fighter
jet to board the USS Abraham Lincoln, an aircraft

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.120
carrier, in 2003.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:14.020
Arising as a solution to a problem first encountered
with Dwight Eisenhower in 1953, this rule

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:19.760
was established after an incident in which
the similarly named flights of Air Force 8610

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:24.700
and Eastern Air Lines Flight 8610 confused
ground support and military officials.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:30.330
Henceforth, Air Force One was adopted, applied,
and continues to be recognized nationwide

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:36.000
as the presidential plane in the U.S. today...well,
that and a type of cool Nike sneakers.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Number 2.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.070
The Other Presidential Plane
As many may assume from the business mogul's

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:45.900
reputation, sitting president Trump had his
own plane before entering the White House.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:51.390
In a 2015 interview, Trump bragged to Rolling
Stone magazine that his private plane, a Boeing

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:57.620
757-200 coated in gold and Trump brand logos,
was "bigger than Air Force One, which is a

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.340
step down from [his plane] in every way."

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:05.540
In fact, though, Air Force One is the larger
of the two by a wide margin.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.571
With its four engines compared to the private
Trump jet's two, the presidential plane is

00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:13.410
also faster and capable of flying further.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:18.660
About the only area in which Trump's private
aircraft surpasses Air Force One is in sheer

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.660
extravagance.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:24.460
Hosting features such as a movie theater,
Rolls Royce branded engines, and 24 karat

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:30.080
gold-plated seatbelts, the president's personal
plane isn't exactly focused on utilitarian

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:36.160
functionality and high-grade security, making
Air Force One the superior vehicle for protecting

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.710
the head of state.

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:38.760
Number 1.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.930
Ready to Launch
Following up on the prerogative to remain

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:47.030
as independently functional as possible, Air
Force One never docks to a loading bay once

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:48.960
it touches down at an airport.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.440
It doesn't even require the typical ground
support equipment of normal planes as the

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.550
jet has a built-in staircase that projects
and retracts from the lower deck doors.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:04.230
This can be employed when not wanting to risk
the use of any potentially sabotaged staircases.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:08.820
Once it arrives, Air Force One doesn't move
from its landing spot as it remains ready

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.500
to take off at a moment's notice.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.920
In the interim, all access to the plane is
heavily monitored and nearly everyone aside

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:21.160
from the flight crew are denied the chance
to even enter the proximity of the jet.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:25.970
Surprisingly most high-ranking politicians
are excluded from even visiting the plane

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.450
without invitation from the head of state.

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:34.480
And so, Air Force One stays ever vigilant
and secure, prepared for any precarious scenario

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.490
in which a president might find themselves.
