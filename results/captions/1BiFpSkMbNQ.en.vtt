00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hey guys Chrisfix here

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.800
and today Im going to show you what you should do

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.500
before you go to start a car that's been sitting for a long time.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.000
And by a long time I mean the car has been sitting without being started or

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.080
moved for at least 4 to 6 months, or longer. In this case I got mustang from an online

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.260
auction. I'll be turning it into drift car. The problem is I don't know if it starts.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.460
But I do know the car has been sitting for awhile. Even though I want to see if the car will start up.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.280
Before we do that I want to go over a couple of IMPORTANT things to check so we

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.000
don't cause any damage to the engine when we go to start it.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.800
That being said the first thing to check was this key was really hard to get in and out. In is not too bad,

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.860
but getting it out is a little tough. But luckily a sticking key is usually a quick and easy fix.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.489
So to fix the sticking ignition lock
we're going to be using one of these dry

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.579
lubricant sprays but instead of me just
fixing it real quick,

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.120
I wanted to show you guys how a lock actually works and why it's hard for

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.660
your key to move in and out. So there are two main reasons why your key might be

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.719
hard to move in and out of the lock, and the first reason is every time you put

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.630
your key in your pocket you have a
chance of getting lint on the key, and

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.990
then when you go use the key in your
lock you force that lint in here and it

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.070
just gums things up.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.970
The other reason is, watch these pins
right here, you can see when you push the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.810
key in, the pins move out of the way and become even so that you could pop the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.360
lock open or start the car

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.900
So if these pins aren't lubricated, it
could be difficult to move the key in

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.409
and out.

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.409
So what we're going to do is we're going to spray a dry lock lube. It's a dry

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.979
lubricant that goes in wet and then
liquid evaporates and provides

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.340
lubrication so the key could slide in
and out without getting hung up. So you

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.530
can see how well the lubrication worked in here,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.799
now let's go try this out in the Mustang. So make sure you roll down a window or

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.240
leave a door open or something. So just shake this up. And you really don't need a lot

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.259
just a little burst. Work our key in and
let's see;

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.900
All right now that is a lot better and
that's the first fix on our mustang.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.259
In this video I'm going to show you tons of little tips and tricks just like this

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.500
and at the end of this video we're gonna
go try to start this car and see if she

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.140
runs. Cars are not meant to sit around

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.950
they're meant to be used. So when they sit around one of the biggest problems

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.290
is parts get rusty and the fluids in the
engine and transmission and all that,

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.650
start to break down; so with the car off the ground

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.590
I'm going to show you how to get this
car ready so we could safely start the engine

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.970
All right the first thing to do is get
under the hood and check the engine oil;

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.980
actually, before we even do that, when a car sits animals like to make your car their new home.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.850
So they'll build nests out of straw and
leaves which could easily catch fire with a hot engine.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.280
So take a look around and make sure you don't see any nest from animals anywhere in the engine

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.569
The other place to look is in the grill
and also down below the grill;

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.769
not only for animals but leaves and
debris starts getting stuck up here,

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.250
which will cause your car to overheat
when you first start it. And actually you

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.489
could see right here it looks like we
have a bird of some sort

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.749
actually it looks like a hummingbird
that kind of got wedged up here and stuck. (R.I.P.)

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.810
So real quick just look for stuff like
this and nests from animals.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.200
So the first fluid we want to check and
probably the most important fluid to

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.960
check is the engine oil, because it's the lifeblood of your engine.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.610
Imagine if we went to start the engine
and it happens to be little to no oil in there;

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.600
or if the oil is old and broken
down and provides no protection.

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.959
You could cause some serious damage. And you can see here we're VERY LOW on oil;

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.959
actually I wonder if there's even any
oil in this engine so let's drain it and find out.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.670
I want to catch an oil sample to get
analized which could give us some useful

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.970
information on the condition of the
engine. So just loosen the drain plug

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.709
and drain the oil gotta catch some oil
for the sample; good.

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.010
And with the oil completely drained
screw in the plug and tighten it down;

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.620
not too much just so that snug. Whipe the remaining oil off and let's remove the

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.300
oil filter. Now this filter is mounted
sideways and I hate when they design

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.110
it like that because it makes it a
complete mess to remove.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.310
To combat that mess, a tip I have is to
use tin foil right underneath the filter

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.590
to funnel the oil as you remove the
filter.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.010
See what I mean? Look at the oil getting everywhere. But luckily the tin foil

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.210
trick works pretty good.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.900
Now we can install the new filter. Remove the foil for a quick and easy cleanup

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.850
and only hand tighten the filter.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.060
There's no need to get any tighter than
that; and I always write the current

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.280
mileage on the oil filter so i won't
forget it.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.959
Now all we need to do is fill the engine
with oil. Grab a funnel and an awesome

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.779
tip is to pour the oil from the
container sideways just like this.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.160
When you pour it sideways notice the oil pours out smoothly and it isn't coming

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.220
out in waves which usually makes a mess. I'm using full synthetic high mileage

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.320
motor oil which is perfect for this
engine, and the stresses we're gonna be

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.280
putting it through as a drift car.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.140
Alright so checking and changing your
engine oil is probably one of the most

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.720
important things you could do before
starting an engine that's been sitting for a while.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.419
The next VERY important thing that we're going to do is we're going to be using

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.680
some frogging oil in each of the
cylinders to lubricate the cylinder

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.660
walls before we start the engine.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.680
So when an engine sits for a long time
all the oil drips down to the bottom of

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.669
the drain pan;

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.000
even the oil that supposed to be coating the cylinders slowly makes its way down.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.640
So the cylinders are completely dry and that's where the fogging oil comes into play.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.210
To fog the engine, remove the spark plug
wire and then remove the spark plug.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.080
And since we have to take the spark
plugs out to fog the cylinders,

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.060
now's a good time to inspect the spark
plugs. So you want to make sure that there's

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.700
no cracks in this ceramic here if there
is you have to replace it. And you want

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.980
to look at the area that in the engine
and sparks you want to make sure it's

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.430
not gummed up with oil.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.479
If it is clean it off or replace them.
And you also want to check the gap.

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:38.220
On this Mustang that gap supposed to be .055 of an inch, so we take our gapping

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.000
tool, we take our spark plug and we
gently move it across until it kind of

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.360
gets stuck. And you can see it's starting to
get stuck around .055 you want to be

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.910
careful with these platinum plugs you
don't really want to rub against them

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.060
hard because you will remove the
platinum coating. The electrode here

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.510
doesn't look horrible but these are
probably the original Ford plugs so they

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.660
really should be replaced but I think a
really cool video would be putting this

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.220
car on the dino

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.760
and testing different brand spark
plugs and seeing what makes the most

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.410
power. So i'm going to wait to change
these, until then

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.980
Now to fog the cylinder all you're gonna do is go into the sparkplug hole with

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.520
the spray and hold the trigger down for one or two seconds.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.560
Just like that. And what it does is it
put a thin coat of oil on the

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.040
cylinder walls and piston rings because
extra lubrication is never a bad thing. *Wink, wink*

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.040
Now I'm going to spray this stuff in
each cylinder so there's four on this

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.430
side for on that side and that's going
to completely lubricate the upper

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.630
combustion chamber.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.140
All right now with all the cylinders
fogged over and lubricated,

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.770
we have something else that's very
important that we need to do with any

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.790
car that's been sitting for a while. And
that is draining the gas tank

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.360
old gas doesn't burn as good as new
gas, plus old gas can clog up the fuel

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.810
system so we need to remove the old gas
and add in some new gas

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.440
so grab a hose and push it down until it
hits the bottom of the tank. Now grab a

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.390
pump and connect the hose to the pump

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.500
so you can pump out the gas. Then start pumping the gas out and have an empty

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.700
gas container ready.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.520
Once the gas starts running down the
hose it's going to create suction and

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.170
pull the rest of the gas in the tank

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:06.150
out with it so you can remove the pump. Just try not to make a mess, like me. And

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.670
the key to making this work is to have
the end of the hose below the car's gas tank like this

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.860
so now we have gravity doing our work
the gasoline is getting pulled down by

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.610
gravity and it's going right into the
tank and once you remove the hand pump

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.270
it's actually a decent flow. So be sure
to have an extra gas tank

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:25.170
just in case this one fills up. Alright
so we just ran out of gas which is good

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.010
that means our tank is empty and that is
all there is to it.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.370
So we siphened the whole tank empty. There might be a little bit of gas left in

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.610
there but now we'll put some fresh gas
in there it'll dilute any of the bad

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:41.070
gas that's remaining in here and it
should be good enough to start. And in

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.370
this case we removed about seven to
eight gallons of gas, and you're probably

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.850
wondering okay so what do I do with all
this gas? Your local recycle center

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.090
will take the gas because you don't know
if it's any good; or you could try

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.240
running this stuff in your lawn mower
and if it runs in the lawn mower

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.660
then you know the gas is still good. Now with the old gas removed and some fresh

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.920
gas in the tank

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.910
the last thing we want to do before we
start the engine is check the coolant. We

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:05.930
want to check the level, which you can
see on the side here. And the coolant has

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.540
to be filled to that line right there.
And then we want to open up our coolant

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:09.969
reservoir,

00:08:09.969 --> 00:08:13.449
and use one of these hydrometers and
these are actually really inexpensive.

00:08:13.449 --> 00:08:16.689
And all you do is you put it inside the
reservoir you squeeze the bulb up here

00:08:16.689 --> 00:08:18.699
and it'll take a sample for you.

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:22.629
you can see our sample is brightly
colored just give it a tap make sure

00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:26.139
there's no air bubbles. And then we want to check this temperature here, so we

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:30.039
look here this is fahrenheit in the blue
and we're protected to negative 35

00:08:30.039 --> 00:08:34.360
degrees around there, and that's exactly
where we want to be for a 50-50 mix. So a

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.439
combination of bright colored coolan,t
whether it's orange, whether it's green,

00:08:38.439 --> 00:08:41.500
purple, whatever color coolant is you
want to be brightly colored and then you

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.639
should protect the negative 34 degrees
Fahrenheit which this is so our cooling

00:08:45.639 --> 00:08:49.269
system is in good shape and I'll wait
'till later down the road to change the

00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:53.329
coolant. After doing the coolant we're
technically safe so we could start the engine.

00:08:53.439 --> 00:08:56.290
But before we start the engine there's a few more things that I want to cover

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.089
just to be extra safe,

00:08:58.089 --> 00:09:01.120
such as the power steering fluid right
here.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.360
The power steering fluid is really easy
to check. You see here it says minimum

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.600
and maximum so it has to be between
these two lines, and it's filled right at

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.949
the top which is good.

00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:12.490
The next fluid the check is another non essential for running the engine but

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.970
it's very essential for stopping the car
if we take it for a test drive, and

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:19.540
that's checking the brake fluid. On the
side of the brake fluid there's a max

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.720
line right up here and there is a
minimum line right down here

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.809
so you want to make sure the brake
fluid is in between both of those lines.

00:09:25.809 --> 00:09:28.779
If your brakes are worn out, your brake
fluid is going to be on the lower end. And

00:09:28.779 --> 00:09:29.509
if your brakes are brand new

00:09:30.009 --> 00:09:32.920
it's probably going to be on the upper
end. All right this is really exciting

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.459
our fluids are changed we have, fresh
fluids, fresh oil.

00:09:36.459 --> 00:09:39.220
So now we're going to go see if we could start the car. I think the battery's

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.680
going to be dead. I charged it up but I
think it's really bad.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.040
Yeah I got nothing, so we're gonna go put a jump starter on the battery.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.160
Now I don't know if you guys have ever
seen these mini jump starters, but they

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.269
are great!

00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:53.170
you get the cables and then you get the
mini jump starter, check this out.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:57.970
That's going to start the car. Just pop
that open, plug this in, and we're ready

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.970
to go. Black to the negative red to the
positive.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.160
All right let's see what we got here.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.960
Come on baby startup...

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.020
Oh...

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.260
Come on.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:19.020
Come on... So I'm not gonna go to diagnose
this now. We're not gonna go test all the

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:23.520
different systems, but what I think it
might be a fuel pump not completely sure,

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.400
so we're going to test that theory out
with some starter fluid. So with the air box

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.320
off, we're gonna go try to start the car.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.580
And I'm going to add starter fluid. Go 'head, start 'er up!

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:47.280
Aww man! That is exciting! That is what I'm talking about! The car is running! This is awesome!

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.890
So right now it is literally running on
the starter fluid.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.980
Now if that doesn't get your heart going, I don't know what does. I am pumped so the

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.210
starting fluid worked.

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:08.420
I think the fuel pump is bad I'm gonna
go do a fuel pressure test and all that

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.420
other stuff. That's going to be in the
next video of the series on building

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.260
this drift car.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.430
So stay tuned. Hopefully this video was helpful and now you know when you go to

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.290
start a car that's been sitting for a
while

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.920
what you need to do so when you started
up the engine won't get damaged.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.070
Now I need to get a fuel pump and I also need to get a battery.

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:27.650
This thing is amazing, I love these
little jump starters.
