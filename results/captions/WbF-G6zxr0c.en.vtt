00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:22.260
Top 10 Famous Historic Figures Who Suffered
Horrifying 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.260
Diseases

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:37.730
10.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.000
Edgar Allan Poe Died of Rabies

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.520
The death of Edgar Allan Poe in 1849 has long
been a freaky source of mystery.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.690
After vanishing for nearly a week after leaving
his home in Richmond, Virginia, the poet finally

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.230
turned up lying in a gutter in Baltimore,
wearing someone else’s clothes and nearly

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.540
incoherent.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.760
Poe then spent four days suffering extreme
hallucinations, before spiraling into madness

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.760
and dying.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.820
At the time, the cause of his death (and the
circumstances surrounding it) were considered

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.370
a total mystery.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.500
We still don’t know for absolute certain
what killed him, as that would require DNA

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.500
testing.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.140
But in 1996, Dr. R. Michael Benitez was participating
in a conference where medical practitioners

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.890
were given an anonymous patient and a list
of symptoms and asked to diagnose them.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.250
Unbeknownst to him, Benitez was given Poe.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.840
The specialist doctor took one look at the
‘anonymous patient’s’ file and declared

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.310
it “a clear case of rabies.”

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.020
In the 19th century, rabies was extremely
common.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.520
It now seems likely Poe was bitten by a rabid
animal and succumbed to the horrifying disease

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.930
before he could tell anyone.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.080
While the theory isn’t one hundred percent
watertight – Poe showed no signs of hydrophobia,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.030
which is a common symptom of rabies – it
may well be the closest we ever get to solving

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.060
this aptly ghoulish mystery.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.060
9.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.890
Beethoven was Born with Syphilis

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.780
One of our favorite pieces of trivia is that
Beethoven, the legendary composer who wrote

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.460
some of the best music in history, was deaf.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.530
From the mid-1790s, he was affected by a buzzing
noise in his ears.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.570
By the age of 30 he was losing his hearing
badly.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.280
Many of his greatest works were written after
that time.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.860
One tidbit often gets left out of this story.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.660
A few years back, the University of Maryland’s
annual Historical Clinicopathological Conference

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.170
decided to look into what might have caused
Beethoven’s deafness.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.150
Although the passage of time has made it impossible
to say for certain, they did come up with

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.930
one candidate they thought extremely likely:
syphilis.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.420
One symptom of syphilis can be deafness, and
syphilis was way common in Beethoven’s time.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.570
It’s thought his father had it, which may
go some way toward explaining how Beethoven

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.770
got infected.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.660
Like HIV, syphilis can be passed from mother
to child in the womb.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.420
If Beethoven’s dad had infected his mom,
it’s almost certain that’s where the composer’s

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.750
ear-destroying STI came from.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.750
8.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.690
Tutankhamun Looked Like an Inbred Yokel

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:59.930
Today, it’s widely known that inbreeding
is a bad idea.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.989
Aside from being totally gross, getting jiggy
with your sister can result in a child suffering

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.040
truly awful disabilities.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.020
In Ancient Egypt, though, they hadn’t quite
figured that out yet.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.920
Royals thought inbreeding would help keep
their line pure.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.800
Instead, it resulted in pharaohs who looked
like inbred yokels.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.130
One of whom was the legendary Tutankhamun.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.310
King Tut came from a long line of inbreds
and boy did it show.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.900
In the words of the Wall Street Journal, King
Tut had “anterior incisors and an overbite

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.819
(buck teeth), a cleft palate, curvature of
the spine (scoliosis), a club foot and a grossly

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:33.940
elongated head (dolichocephaly).

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.160
He also had feminine breasts and hips, as
did several of his male predecessors.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.610
Almost certainly, there were other undetected
defects of vital organs.”

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.420
In other words, this ancient king looked less
like some great and powerful ruler, and more

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.239
like the sort of guy you might see looking
for work as an extra in the remake of Deliverance.

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.239
7.

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.450
Samuel Johnson Probably Had Tourette Syndrome

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.510
Samuel Johnson was one of the wittiest writers
of his time.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.850
A coarse, vulgar beast of a man, he palled
around with guys like Johnathon Swift, while

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.680
redefining what the English language was capable
of.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.380
He was also pretty odd.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.020
Contemporary accounts report that he liked
to make weird-ass noises while sitting in

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.270
polite company, and had a compulsive habit
of rubbing his knee while talking.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.669
On the streets, he was prone to gesticulating
wildly at nothing.

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.299
Do those symptoms sound familiar?

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.299
They might.

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.469
Although Dr. Johnson’s tics caused hilarity
at the time, modern doctors have posthumously

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:26.689
diagnosed him with Tourette Syndrome.

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:29.969
While the most-commonly depicted form involves
shouting out swear words, plenty of sufferers

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:33.669
are simply stuck making nervous twitches and
involuntary noises.

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.500
Dr. Johnson was evidently one-such sufferer.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.779
He used to cluck like a hen, shake his head
wildly and whistle uncontrollably.

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:43.939
It got so bad in later life that gangs of
children used to follow him down the street,

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:45.060
pointing and laughing.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.060
6.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.060
H.P.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.060
Lovecraft’s Weird Cold Aversion

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.180
Horror maestro H.P.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.800
Lovecraft was one peculiar dude.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.909
For one thing, he was a lifelong anti-Semite
who managed to absently-mindedly marry a Jewish

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:56.909
woman.

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:00.030
For another, he was obsessed with the dangers
of interbreeding, in a way that went beyond

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.340
bog-standard racism and into a pathological
fear.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.460
But perhaps weirdest of all might be his strange
aversion to the cold.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.499
If the temperature ever dropped too low, Lovecraft
was apt to collapse into a dead faint from

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:13.960
which he couldn’t be woken until warmed
up again.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.750
Interestingly, we have absolutely no idea
what caused this.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.020
It seemed to come on in the writer’s adulthood
and wasn’t triggered by any one thing.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.240
Some have linked it to his frequent migraines,
while others have suggested it was psychological.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.830
Lovecraft himself seemed to link it to the
cancer that eventually killed him.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.870
At any rate, it made him develop an extreme
paranoia about the cold, a paranoia that filtered

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.650
through into some of his stories like the
gruesome Cool Air.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.650
5.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.080
Darwin’s Whole Life was One Big Puke-a-thon

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.120
About a year after his long voyage on the
Beagle, Charles Darwin developed a bizarre

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.830
condition that would haunt him for the rest
of his life.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.960
About three hours after eating, he would get
extreme abdominal pains, followed by hideous

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.960
nausea.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.199
Moments later, he would expel everything in
a great big vomit-a-thon that left him utterly

00:05:58.199 --> 00:05:59.199
exhausted.

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:02.539
At some points in his life, the condition
got so bad that he was basically rendered

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:03.539
an invalid.

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:04.979
The freakiest part of all?

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.080
We still don’t know what caused it.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.089
Although all Darwin’s friends thought he
was a hypochondriac, modern doctors have subsequently

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:14.449
diagnosed him with Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome
(CVS).

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:17.960
The problem is we’re still not sure what
really causes it.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:24.409
While Darwin could get an accurate diagnosis
if he was alive today, even in 2016 his doctors

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:26.089
likely couldn’t do a lot to help.

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:29.860
Was it maybe related to his time at sea?

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.309
Who the heck knows?

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:32.309
4.

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:33.740
Julius Caesar Had Endless Strokes

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.870
You may have heard before that Julius Caesar
had epilepsy.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.199
Certainly that’s what people have thought
for centuries.

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:42.689
When you take into account his symptoms – such
as collapsing into fits – it definitely

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:44.210
sounds plausible.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.800
But a recent study from 2015 has another idea.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.669
According to the authors, there’s a good
chance Caesar suffered a catastrophic series

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:53.119
of mini-strokes.

00:06:53.119 --> 00:06:57.259
The technical name for these is a series of
Transient Ischemic Attacks, but it amounts

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:58.520
to the same thing.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.949
Rather than suffering the same illness as
people like Graham Greene and Ian Curtis,

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:05.449
the ruler of Rome may well have had a series
of debilitating strokes.

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:09.629
If that’s the case, it’s perhaps lucky
for Caesar’s posterity that he got assassinated

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:10.629
when he did.

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:14.710
A proper stroke could have left him utterly
incapacitated and at the mercy of his enemies;

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:19.270
a far worse fate than the quick, brutal stabbing
that ultimately felled him.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.270
3.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.219
Lenin’s Brain was Turning to Stone

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:27.219
When he finally died, infamous revolutionary
Vladimir Lenin was only 53 years old.

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:31.699
His death came on the tail-end of a series
of strokes, and shortly after, he was placed

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:33.300
in Stalin’s personal care.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.509
At the time, nobody knew what the heck was
wrong with him.

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:38.770
First Russian doctors suspected mental exhaustion.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.150
Then lead poisoning.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.969
Finally, they just rolled with syphilis on
the basis that seemingly everybody in the

00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:46.219
olden days had the dreaded French disease.

00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:49.909
It wasn’t until they performed an autopsy
on the dead Communist that they uncovered

00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:51.499
the horrifying truth.

00:07:51.499 --> 00:07:54.479
Lenin’s brain had been slowly turning to
stone.

00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:59.979
The technical name for his condition was cerebrovascular
atherosclerosis, and it’s creepy as hell.

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:05.419
Basically, calcium deposits built up in his
cerebral arteries to the point they became

00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:06.419
nearly solid.

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:11.080
When the morticians tapped the affected areas
with tweezers, they made a sound like stone.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.649
Creepily, this wasn’t a case of 1920s man
running up against something he didn’t understand

00:08:15.649 --> 00:08:17.689
and being helpless in the face of it.

00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:21.529
Even today, someone with Lenin’s condition
would be unlikely to live much longer than

00:08:21.529 --> 00:08:22.599
he did.

00:08:22.599 --> 00:08:23.599
2.

00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:25.719
Akhenaten Probably Suffered a Hormone Disorder

00:08:25.719 --> 00:08:29.240
The Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten likely came
from the same line that later produced the

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.119
yokel-like Tutankhamun.

00:08:31.119 --> 00:08:35.120
With that in mind, you’d probably expect
to find that he had some weird stuff going

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.120
on.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:41.340
And you’d be right: Akhenaten suffered the
same elongated head as his more-famous descendant.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.300
But Akhenaten also had some strange gripes
that were all his own.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:50.330
In 2009, professor of dermatology and an expert
on visual diagnosis at the Yale University

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:54.510
School of Medicine, Irwin Braverman, came
up with his own theory.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.840
Akhenaten was probably suffering a hormone
disorder that made his male body look like

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.370
it belonged to a woman.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:05.130
In ancient drawings, Akhenaten is often depicted
as having wide hips, a narrow waist and feminine

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.130
breasts.

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:08.850
Yet we know for a fact that the ancient ruler
was male.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.750
Seems like somebody’s made a mistake, until
you realize the pharaoh’s genetic defects

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.600
caused by inbreeding could have left him with
an extreme hormone imbalance.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:20.270
Specifically, overproduction of the enzyme
aromatase could have caused his body to be

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.510
flooded with estrogen from an early age.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:26.930
That would explain how a guy who is meant
to be male could wind up looking so spectacularly

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.760
female in ancient engravings.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.050
However, since we’ve yet to find Akhenaten’s
mummy, we still can’t say for certain that

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.780
this is the case.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:34.780
1.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.940
King Herod Had Some of the Nastiest Ailments
in History

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.810
Herod the Great was an overachieving king
who, among other things, built the largest

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.460
artificial harbor in the Mediterranean.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.400
Today, though, he’s mainly remembered for
ordering the Slaughter of the Innocents in

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.530
an attempt to kill baby Jesus – something
many now think never actually happened.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:52.930
Apparently, God didn’t get the memo.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:57.200
When it came time to shove Herod off this
mortal coil, He did it in the nastiest way

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.310
possible.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:04.010
According to the ancient writer Flavius Josephus
(who lived about 100 years after Herod died),

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:07.790
the king “had a fever, though not a raging
fever, an intolerable itching of the whole

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:13.070
skin, continuous pains in the intestines,
tumors of the feet as in dropsy, inflamation

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.150
of the abdomen, and gangrene of the privy
parts.”

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.970
He also suffered convulsions of the limbs
and had foul, fetid breath that could strip

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:20.970
paint.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:26.450
But the real awful bit is contained in those
last five words: gangrene of the privy parts.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:31.130
Herod’s junk was so awash with bacteria
that it literally began dying while it was

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:32.430
still attached to him.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:35.720
Today, we know this disease as Fournier’s
Gangrene, and it’s basically one of the

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.140
most-painful, disgusting ways you can possibly
die.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.080
Except this isn’t what actually killed Herod,
but was likely a final – and extremely painful

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.080
– complication.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.770
In fact, it’s now thought that chronic kidney
disease did the Biblical king in.

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:52.810
Maybe so, but it’s the image of his decaying
wang falling apart as its flesh is eaten away

00:10:52.810 --> 00:11:07.870
that’s really gonna stick with us.
