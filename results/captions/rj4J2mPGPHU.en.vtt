00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:09.149
I'm on a journey across North Korea and after a week, it's time for me to leave the capital Pyongyang

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.949
On my way I pass under the imposing arch of a reunification

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.980
Impressive

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:34.320
Reunification of Korea might be the aim the leadership, but the reality is this is still a country divided

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.329
North Korea

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.139
It's a brutal dictatorship a country shrouded in mystery suspicion and fear

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.210
but after a week

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.809
I think I'm getting past the stereotypes

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.860
This is a culture where reverence to the great leaders is all

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.129
And the sense of mass unity is so strong

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.908
And now I gained access to areas of the country that are normally off-limits

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.779
To understand the wall that divided Korea

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.899
It's interesting to hear your side of it because we were told we had won a new believe unit one

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.479
To learn about its ancient past

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:30.369
And what the leadership claims it has planned for the future with strength with all built in a year

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.240
Traveling away from cities. I'll be meeting the people of rural North Korea. So that's

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.810
What do you want to do and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:49.089
Once again, I'll be accompanied by local guides, but maybe they're the ones who will reveal the real North Korea

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.109
Criticizing our leaders is like criticizing ourselves

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.769
And of mountain ranges beaches and forests

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.258
I'm about to discover a very different side of the DPRK

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.890
Opened in 2001 the 30 meter tall arch of reunification

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.759
represents the great leader Kim il-sung's dream of

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.579
reunifying North and South Korea

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.429
It's also the starting point of the road that will take me directly to the border

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.390
And so far traffic doesn't seem to be a problem

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.399
this is the reunification highway which runs a hundred miles from Pyongyang to the

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.050
demilitarized zone

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.050
well, I suppose sadly because

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:01.410
Reunification hasn't happened yet. This road is one most empty hardly a single vehicle of six Lee Highway

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.890
miles of empty road

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:14.189
I'm heading a hundred miles south to the DMZ the Demilitarized Zone the two and a half mile wide

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.519
border that splits the Korean Peninsula into

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.829
With me and my two guides trunk. Oh, oh, so yeah

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:28.379
After three hours

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.589
We arrived at the joint security area

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:36.828
The one place on the DMZ where you can cross from one side of Korea to the other

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.250
Looking after me is the rather intimidating senior leftenant. Hwang jung jin

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.938
It's ago so comenzarÃ¡ personal sins of Buddhism

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.769
College Hyun Joong Ki do eBay or chip chips?

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.748
Contain a single possible way. So use of taboos are an independent

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:04.669
The Demilitarized Zone was created as a result of the Korean War in the 1950s

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.759
Like most people in the West Island that the war started when North Korea invaded South Korea

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:17.508
Who then defended by the UN and America, but the senior leftenant sees it rather differently

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:26.749
In our attention delicate and even - no she doesn't

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:34.549
Tampons are suitable because from a co the American citizen

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:46.259
But really nobody won the Korean War has just been a ceasefire for over 60 years

00:04:48.549 --> 00:04:50.019
It's interesting

00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:57.119
To hear your your side of it because a man was 10 years old when the war the armistice

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:02.158
Ended the conflict in 1953 and we were told we had won

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:06.419
And a new believe unit one. So there were

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:11.428
Some terrible Sigismund

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:19.078
Hamari pakki God Virginia border Gaza was a chocolate onion. You've asked me a thousand Ataman

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:26.549
Well, I would say the worlds on both sides so it's a yeah

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:29.939
Neither side won

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.649
Our minders are not particularly happy with me questioning who won the war

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:45.570
So we walk on to what is probably the most militarily and politically sensitive area in the whole of the Korean Peninsula

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:53.640
These blue UN conference rooms are the only place you can walk between North and South Korean

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.620
the borders marked by the raised concrete line in the middle of the Hutt's

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.570
Community Nancy Gildea MD goksaheun Harun donor favorites John Grossman. I

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.709
Have been here once before from the other side 1996

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:21.900
22 years ago while filming in South Korea. I stood on the other side of the border as part of a tour group

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:29.940
Escorted by American soldiers North Korea seemed an impenetrable land but I have always wanted to see it for myself

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.869
If you wish to make across the new North Korea, please do so at another table

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:45.390
And more than two decades on here I am this time crossing from north to south

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.090
The atmosphere is still tense

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.650
So this is 22 years later I

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.649
remember thinking then that's you know, I

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.510
it was like it was a

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.300
presented as a blank wall there from which you would get no response at all and yet I

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.220
Felt I wanted to know more you had to know more. You can't just have one side of the story

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.350
You've got to look at the other side of the story. So

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.140
It's rather

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:28.540
It's I'm rather pleased that I'm given the chance have been given the chance today to see the other side as well so

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.440
This time I don't have to

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.890
Go back

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:40.060
And I have the doors who didn't before that live group of people. I can come in on my own I

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:45.880
Can walk over it's North Korea and I can stay here for a bit and probably have my lunch here

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.919
And that that I think that's something I

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.530
Feel that's an achievement is of some kind for all of us

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.770
Sadly these huts represent a massive failure of diplomacy

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:10.030
And since 1953 North Korea has found it necessary to create one of the biggest armies in the world

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:18.759
It reportedly spends 25 percent of its GDP on the military and it's notorious nuclear weapons program

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.000
None of this makes for good small talk

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:29.890
Nuclear warheads and nuclear missiles have cost your country and a lot of money to develop

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:38.170
Bougie Washington do bakusaiga so dear old rocky. So do Bo or Marco we don't haggle. Khadija and also video to mushroom

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.510
Hopefully there are signs

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:45.069
that there may be a change in relations between

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.920
your side and

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.170
America is this good news

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.710
Buland also supposed to go thing on Berlin

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.569
Well, I hope that people recognize that

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:03.489
We don't really need wars and armies and

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.390
weapons

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:09.069
We should understand each other by meeting each other talking to each other

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.279
sharing our experience rather than

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.579
Fighting each other. It's a simple message and

00:09:16.579 --> 00:09:23.739
You know, I hope one day more people will understand. You don't come our own theater group, Aaron Harvey

00:09:24.529 --> 00:09:26.529
imbecile you crooked ghost

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.370
It's good to meet you, and I hope you're successful with no more loss of life, you know

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:44.050
After this the guide seemed to relax if only the real peace talks could end this well a

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:50.440
Sad legacy of the Korean War is that most of North Korea was destroyed by American bombing?

00:09:50.839 --> 00:09:53.289
Leaving few reminders of what was here before?

00:09:55.610 --> 00:10:02.979
But just a couple of miles away from the DMZ is a town that a thousand years ago was the capital of Korea

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.050
This is caisson

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:19.709
During the Korean War it was part of South Korea so was spared bombardment

00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:31.479
Now part of the north this city and my hotel make me feel like I've arrived in a totally different century

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:50.229
The buildings in the hotel are over a hundred years old and as night falls the guides and I are entertained by

00:11:16.939 --> 00:11:18.939
Your fantastic

00:11:27.049 --> 00:11:30.999
See how oh yeah, okay

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:44.619
Yeah

00:11:47.029 --> 00:11:48.290
I

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:55.629
Took greater force to bash this great this yes. I actually spoke about the marks of your match on this charges

00:11:58.579 --> 00:12:04.688
Kaesong has taken me back to North Korea's past. But tomorrow I'll be traveling towards its future

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:20.039
The next morning it's time to leave North Korea's history behind us

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.250
We're driving 300 miles to the beach town of one Sun a place which could play a large role in the DPRK

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.380
of tomorrow

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.680
But the roads are getting worse

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.300
Just about so half way now

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.289
This is the main road and

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.940
And yet it's it's it's pretty rough the surfaces

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.700
can be quite about to see

00:13:03.879 --> 00:13:05.879
Have this slightly

00:13:07.209 --> 00:13:14.158
You are nodding off there no, no I do I do. I'm surprised you can sleep on the road like this

00:13:16.599 --> 00:13:21.778
Winding through the mountains with that the sea at the end of it's quite an adventure. I

00:13:22.419 --> 00:13:24.189
associate the sea with

00:13:24.189 --> 00:13:25.269
holidays

00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:30.748
Do you have summer holidays here as well do holidays when you go away with your families?

00:13:31.869 --> 00:13:37.949
We have we working people have 15 days vacation and we can choose any day

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.810
I go

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.779
To I usually go to the sea beach with my friends

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:53.370
Do you go with your family of me? Like mother and father? Oh, yeah. I got married last year in February

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.330
so oh

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:56.770
There she is

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.770
His wife he can't get away

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.339
After a fairly tortuous four hours

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:09.690
we arrived in the coastal town of warm Sun a

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:15.779
City at the center of Kim Jong Un's plan was to transform the North Korean economy

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.420
Thank you

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.659
I'm hoping the ping-pong won't keep me up

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:46.599
North Korea might be a country that has closed itself from the outside world, but paradoxically

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:51.729
It's also trying to restyle itself as an international beach

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.830
destination

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:55.830
A few miles away from my hotel

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:02.020
Kim jong-un has ambitious plans to turn one sound into the Costa del Korea

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:17.179
The huge construction project here in one Sun

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:24.259
To create a new resort and a massive amount of workers have been brought into the city and these women here

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:27.739
here every morning and other groups all over the city to

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:34.339
Encourage the workers to to build this extraordinary place an extraordinary first time

00:15:37.209 --> 00:15:42.909
I can see it happening for hs2, but they didn't learn a thing or two

00:15:46.309 --> 00:15:49.209
Holidays to North Korea might sound unlikely

00:15:49.309 --> 00:15:57.249
But it's already a popular destination for the Chinese and international tourism is seen as a potential future growth area

00:15:58.639 --> 00:16:01.688
this huge development of luxury beach hotels

00:16:02.149 --> 00:16:07.539
conference centers and golf courses should be completed at the end of 2019, but

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.689
now to avoid disappointment and

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:17.889
Visitors won't have to endure a four-hour drive to get here because they've already built an international airport

00:16:20.959 --> 00:16:25.328
It's all ready to go as even the first advert I've seen here

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.870
But there's a distinct lack of passengers

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.620
Or planes

00:16:36.149 --> 00:16:42.889
What makes this Mary Celeste of airports even more bizarre is that all the shops and bars are fully staffed

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.350
Despite there being no customers

00:16:48.279 --> 00:16:51.159
I suspect they're here for our benefit

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.190
Nothing is

00:16:58.190 --> 00:16:59.630
confounded my

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:00.950
expectations of

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:02.120
DPRK

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:08.559
as much this gleaming new airport, and it seems to me it's a statement of intent that

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.220
DPRK is going out to the world

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:17.920
Come here, you know in order to fill this place. They've got her people from all over the world coming to the country

00:17:18.439 --> 00:17:20.390
So it means that

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:23.679
the country itself will have to be seen by the rest of the world as the

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:27.819
Anion and wealth can be host rather than than you know possible

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.580
bad boy

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:38.500
But I wonder if

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:45.419
International tourists will want to travel to a country that is renowned for food shortages famine and poverty

00:17:49.539 --> 00:17:56.579
With a landscape that is three-quarters mountain north Korea has always struggled to produce enough food for his people

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:04.639
This is the Johnson cooperative farm a few miles outside of one son

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:08.690
And I'm joining farmer Kim Hyung. We in the fields

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:24.470
Yeah, yogi some pure donkey wants to sell go 200 are you yes

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:27.110
Okay, so is it how many tsimko?

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.560
You foot outward only then damn system Sumida

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:36.109
Due to a lack of machinery and fuel most farm work is done by hand

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.800
That's our mothers young

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.499
How am I doing, all right what

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.260
a meter Oh

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:56.989
Your heater had some models head. I'm gonna solve it some good karate or move young thing. Oh,

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.900
Well, that's honest

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.940
That's honest

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:09.380
North Korea's food shortages hit their peak in the mid 1990s

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:16.609
Thanks to a fatal combination of flooding at the end of food imports from the collapsing Soviet Union

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:25.070
Aid agencies estimate more than a million people starved to death and it's something I'd be warned not to bring up

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.960
we

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.889
We remember hearing in the West that you had very bad

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:34.579
shortage of food in the 1990s

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.290
are things

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.290
Much better now

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.280
Ya see - Mira

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:50.059
I'm starting to get used to North Koreans shutting down when I ask uncomfortable questions

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.940
Food supplies might be getting better

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:58.070
but malnutrition is widely reported and though the government may not like to admit it the

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:02.959
Country still requires tens of thousands of tons of food aid each year

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.520
Very nice

00:20:07.559 --> 00:20:09.559
very good

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:13.609
It's around samosas they keep them that way ah

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:26.599
Very nice to meet you. Thank you

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:35.179
Comfortable this is really

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:48.020
Yes, so that's your older brother, what do you want to do I mean

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:56.299
It's as you know anything, uh, Kim Johnson you Roberto bulgogi subha cause I didn't even go inna

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:00.230
Llaha so that chicken duck is a Komachi in for another

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:08.809
Young Hughie offers to make me some food. So I offer up my services as an English teacher

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.900
And what's that?

00:21:12.299 --> 00:21:13.650
clock

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:15.650
brilliant

00:21:17.429 --> 00:21:19.429
What's that

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:28.530
And put out your hand they are hand yeah my hand your hand hand that's good. Yeah

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.659
And let's see, what's that

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:37.950
Tree

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:39.990
Brilliant, that's great

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:48.149
Before I leave the farm my host is very insistent. I try some local food. Oh, this is your kimchi

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:54.780
Under the watchful eye of the great leaders

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.340
Mmm

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.600
It's very good, um

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.200
But it's very fiery

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.200
Fiery it's like eating fire

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:18.900
Some chili in here. I think nice and nutty vasquez on the demand. Yeah

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.800
Welcome to community don't assume

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.410
Thank you

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:31.889
I've been charmed by this family home

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:40.019
But I can't help but think this generous hospitality is partly to give me the impression that food is in plentiful supply in the DPRK

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.580
It's been a busy day so

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.489
Busy that it's easy to forget it's my 75th birthday

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:55.500
But the guides and my crew are not allowing me to forget

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:24.539
There's always a job for you in the DPRK

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:50.370
The next morning it's time to leave one son and head to a place that some say is the most beautiful in North Korea

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:57.149
On our way to Mount Kumgang and the weather's have changed completely from yesterday

00:23:58.059 --> 00:24:02.999
if that career whether it's a bit like British weather yet one day of sunshine the next day of

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:06.360
bloom and drizzle but

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.719
It's rather attractive along the coastline here

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:18.259
We're driving to the mount kumgang region, it's just 80 miles away

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:22.820
But with North Korean roads, it's another back-breaking three-hour journey

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:30.800
So now something into the mountains I think very suddenly and they have

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:34.310
The last few miles

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:36.630
climbed a lot

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:43.940
As we arrived in Mount Kumgang the rain clears allowing us to begin a hike up the Korean waterfall

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:53.099
After two weeks so yang feels much more like a friend than an official guide

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:59.429
Colorful folders are so white compared to a list

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.429
You're like doing this hiking yes

00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:11.020
trying to get some

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.770
more fresh air and relax and

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:18.659
I'll think of thinking of nothing else about the

00:25:19.179 --> 00:25:26.819
Nature, it's good for the first time since I arrived in the DPRK, I feel a great sense of freedom

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.740
The rockers or North Korea

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.250
Gong Gong sound means diamond mountain

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:53.130
But even on this cloudy day it is stunning

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.780
I'm hoping this is a good place to have a more open

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.899
Conversation about our two countries. I

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.570
Find your country

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.179
so very different from ours and yet sometimes

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.060
Very similar. Oh, how do you get your

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.899
Your news of what's going on in the country

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.659
By mass media, you know TVs and radios and

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:34.540
And buying newspapers as well. What did I tell you about Britain how we live?

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.830
Be honest, you can be honest the British. Yeah

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.920
we feel

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:47.919
Yeah, I mean about appearance you look so different but yeah

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:50.949
and I was thinking about

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.140
In our way of life

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:58.090
which is really based on freedom of speech and freedom of thought and

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:03.639
People could wear what they want and they can dress what they want and they can be as rude as they want about

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:07.419
their leaders, you know presumably you think that's

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.960
Not a good thing

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.720
It's your freedom, it's your freedom

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:18.339
you can do what you want and we have gotta own your

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.659
own style and you have got your own style and your

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.300
citizens can do

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.840
They can do what they want. And yes

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:33.849
and your citizens can do what they want to

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:36.980
yes, I

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.999
mean at home one difference between I

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:44.139
suppose your culture and ours is that we can be

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:47.290
very rude about ah

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:51.459
Leaders here. I feel this you just have a different way of

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:59.559
Looking at things because our leaders are very great and the leaders are not

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:02.350
individual they are

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:05.180
They are

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:08.889
Represent they represent the popular I'll represent us

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:13.060
Mesa's so we cannot criticize ourselves

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.960
Can we

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:22.869
Criticizing our leaders is offending. It's like offending criticize ourselves

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.320
-

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:30.970
What do you think well, I think of my leaders that sometimes they're good

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:35.259
sometimes they're bad and I think they make some wrong decisions and

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.780
taking some right decisions and

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:43.090
You know, they're there that's that's the way they are

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:46.850
Your leaders

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:51.009
If I may respectfully say a very different and I absolutely respect

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.840
the respect

00:28:53.840 --> 00:29:00.369
That you have that you have for your leaders. Yeah, I wouldn't want to change your feelings at all

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:06.400
But I'm it just be nice to talk about really I wouldn't want to change your feelings

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:12.520
No, that's what you feel in your an intelligent person is what we are so different from you

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.680
if you find

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:21.279
Yeah, but you know, I'm not bad. I mean we can talk about these and we have a similar

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:25.509
Intelligence about things but that's good, too. So I

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:30.159
Absolutely respect the respect you have for them and the way you feel about

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:33.010
Okay, I really do

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.409
I know these conversations are not easy for soo young

00:29:39.869 --> 00:29:46.189
But what it has shown me is how every North Korea ties their identity to that of the great leaders

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:50.509
Whoa, I've had many discussions and

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:54.049
So young and I am guide

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:59.689
Is very chatty and she's very funny and we've had quite uninhibited discussions

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:05.059
But I was so difficult whenever you get on to any subject concerning the leadership

00:30:05.059 --> 00:30:06.389
I mean

00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:07.369
They just stop

00:30:07.369 --> 00:30:13.189
I think it's just a very very difficult thing for them to talk about because you don't talk about the leaders

00:30:13.649 --> 00:30:17.358
As soon as you talk about them you demean them in some way. I think that's what it is

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:20.090
I found that companies had quite tricky

00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:24.559
But having said all that

00:30:24.899 --> 00:30:27.319
We have been able to film every day

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:30.859
we've picked up a lot of material and I'm a great believer that

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:37.460
sometimes just seeing the way people know when people talk the way they eat just little glimpses of that and

00:30:37.889 --> 00:30:42.439
The way they cultivate the farms or whatever and gives you a real

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.859
Insight into what's happening in the country

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.270
The next morning we make a speedy return to one son

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:02.060
Thankfully, this is my last North Korean road trip

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:03.860
after this

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:11.029
I hope to catch a plane from once an airport up to mount pink to the place where the story of the Kim dynasty began

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:16.939
And when we arrived at the ghost terminal building things seem to have changed

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.980
People everywhere on the gate

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.600
Boarding card

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.910
Thank you. Thank you. Yeah

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:34.670
But after checking in things seemed to grind to a halt

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:42.289
Well, there's been a bit of a hiccup here because some the

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:50.840
mist you can see is cloaking loose an airport and playing that's taking us up to my pet to cannot take off from

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.589
Pyongyang to come here until this is all cleared

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.100
so we live quite now I'm going to actually I'm

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:01.340
Seeing the plane getting on board

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:04.130
so meanwhile we

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.620
Just hang around the airport

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.410
at least it's not going to get too crowded because

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.080
This is the only flight of the day

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:22.879
After our slightly awkward conversation yesterday I'm hoping Sooyoung is not too annoyed with me

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:34.709
Maybe this might make amends. This is what I used to do a long time ago before I became

00:32:56.919 --> 00:32:58.390
Oh

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:04.679
It's dead fish. Yes, but a live human being I was alive everything James. Yeah

00:33:04.679 --> 00:33:06.869
Yeah, hit quite hard is a big pike

00:33:13.539 --> 00:33:19.049
But suddenly the airport manager who frankly has little else to do has some news

00:33:22.779 --> 00:33:28.709
Ferguson that song yeah. Oh, oh yeah take it off. But but yeah

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:37.710
After hours of inertia as a sudden rush of activity and the plane arrives from Pyongyang

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:47.010
Air Koryo, the country's national airline has one of the oldest fleets in the world. This one was built in 1967

00:33:47.799 --> 00:33:49.799
It's happening

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:53.819
Here's our plane. I think it said we think it's an Antonov Russian plane

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:04.510
It says 6f but there isn't any there's no 6f so I think I'll just sit here

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.400
Finally we're on our way

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:24.989
This 50-year old plane is taking me 500 miles north to mount paektu close to the border with China

00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:31.010
It's very comfortable I wouldn't say the feet

00:34:31.859 --> 00:34:36.499
Functional that's what the wonderful thing about them. They've got all these nice surfaces, and it's

00:34:37.049 --> 00:34:41.209
carpet on the floor living this sort of wallpaper, but she's you know

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:46.219
This is 1960s Travel. Not 21st century travel

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:52.309
Yes, you feel quite comfortable here in economy flying about back to on Carrillo Airlines

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:58.649
After a while the landscape below becomes increasingly mountainous

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:08.889
Unrelieved when the wheels eventually touched down

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:16.479
As we disembark I find myself in a very different-looking part of the country

00:35:20.969 --> 00:35:24.379
About Peck to matter we've come all this way to see

00:35:25.049 --> 00:35:30.049
Just there just below weather. The Sun is setting and it's not one great peak

00:35:30.049 --> 00:35:32.899
It's a sort of a group of mountain, but it's out

00:35:33.509 --> 00:35:35.839
really over there just where the Sun and

00:35:36.359 --> 00:35:42.288
the dark clouds are gathering the three incarnate we see it, but

00:35:44.969 --> 00:35:50.329
But as the Sun sets the clouds clear and the snowy peaks reveal themselves

00:35:54.609 --> 00:35:56.020
Ancient Korean legend

00:35:56.020 --> 00:36:02.909
Has it that the mythical leader dangoon who created Korea was born Mount paektu thousands of years ago

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:07.680
But this area is also home to a slightly more recent legend

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:19.779
After we arrived at the hotel our taste buds are tantalized by a barbecue dinner

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:28.210
I'm basically a potato

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:34.749
That's been toasted on the fire so it's quite dark you feel that well you can't see that light

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:39.730
I'll see it. I could be eating a dead mouse, but you know it actually I'm told it's a potato

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:55.749
It's hard to believe that these rustic surroundings gave birth to the ruling Kim dynasty

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:11.860
The next morning I wake up in the far north of the DPRK and at a hotel

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:15.670
Which I'm not sure often sees actual guests

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.200
But those who make it this far

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:26.169
But probably here to see Mount Peck to a place where kim il-song the first leader of the DPRK made a name for himself

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.569
And just a few miles away

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:32.380
There are the remains of the camp where he lived with his family

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:41.170
I'm given a military guide to show me around the rebuilt

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:47.810
Union everyone

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:53.470
Given delicacy hyunyoung is cutting the root vegetable written ban. Mm. Mm - you spit out

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:59.890
During the first half of the 20th century. Korea was under hostile occupation by Japan

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:06.459
Kimmel's song first gained a reputation as a heroic resistance fighter in the 1930s

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:13.030
Was also here that the Future leader of the DPRK Kim Jong Il was apparently born

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:15.680
so didn't

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:22.810
Answer I said it's unmarked assimilate all the peppers and synchronize Syria numerous hatchet those little ordinary men who have some nice to go chief

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:24.410
Of the greases the middle

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:30.369
Of the Vedic untangled s not answering my sleep to mood X. Has she been young he was human

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:37.959
Cookie cutter he moves. He teleported apparently captured in Boko. He help Ichigo impact somebody wanted to meet each other

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.419
Listen, I see US economy. So good at the age of

00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:44.180
Miraculous moment

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:49.510
It's a great story, but it's widely thought that Kim jong-il was actually born in communist

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:53.919
Russia and how much fighting kim il-song did here is up for debate?

00:38:56.670 --> 00:39:00.019
But while the West sees the Kim dynasty as a dictatorship

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:02.839
Here their worshipped as heroes

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:10.909
Defending their country against Japanese and American invaders and it's this version of history that has helped them to hold on to power

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:13.340
for 70 years

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:17.600
Well, that's a pretty sensational view of that picture

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:24.050
This is a place where a lot comes together the thousands of years of Korean history

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:30.710
symbolizes frying by Malpeque to itself and then just behind me here the monument of the

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:33.769
founder of the DPRK kim ill sung

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:37.700
The past and the present coming together here

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:45.349
As I look at Mount pictu a place that has been sacred to all Koreans for thousands of years

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:52.160
I can't help but wonder if the great leaders and their giant statues will be around for quite as long

00:39:53.640 --> 00:40:00.079
But it's time for me to leave our plane is ready to take us back to the bright lights of Pyongyang

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:04.100
My time in North Korea is drawing to a close

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:21.990
It's my last morning in Pyongyang and

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:28.469
This city which felt totally alien two weeks ago is now strangely familiar

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.620
But there's one area

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:38.519
I've yet to explore a brand new development of apartment shops and restaurants on the bank of the Tatum River

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.949
This is the North Korea of the 21st century and

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:47.620
It's changing

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:52.090
This is called mere a street which means I think future scientists Street

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:56.690
It's one of the sort of miracles of

00:40:57.609 --> 00:41:00.598
the dprk because this street which is

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:05.400
Contains these amazing blocks was all built in a year

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:09.350
It takes me about a year

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:13.800
To get the bedroom painted let alone build entire

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:16.470
modern city street

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:22.099
But even just to build this stuff that quickly

00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:26.059
shows ambition and a kind of sense of

00:41:27.669 --> 00:41:33.449
National commitment commitment to making this ever look like a modern city

00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:40.859
Since becoming leader Kim jong-un has promised to revitalize the economy of the DPRK

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:48.089
Many people say that free market forces are slowly taking hold as the old ideals of communism slip away

00:41:49.419 --> 00:41:54.898
Maybe in five years time. This street will be full of muck dolls and adverts for iPhones

00:41:55.569 --> 00:42:00.508
If so, I'm glad to have seen it before it becomes like everywhere else

00:42:10.109 --> 00:42:17.629
When I first looked out over Pyongyang, I remember feeling very wary apprehensive

00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:22.729
Was all very unfamiliar slightly threatening

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:26.419
Now two weeks later. I must say I feel much more

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:29.300
Relaxed I feel almost

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:34.429
Part of the city after I know it much more and I certainly feel less threatened

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:42.139
I know that the the ideology here permeates every single aspect of life, and I know that

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:46.070
We've not seen everything and yet

00:42:46.859 --> 00:42:48.859
What I have seen feels

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:57.439
Well, it doesn't feel grim it doesn't feel brutal as someone have us think is actually I

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:00.710
Would say not an unhappy place

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:06.139
But it feels to me this country is at a crossroads on the one hand

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:10.430
It wants to open up to the wider world to expand culturally and economically

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:14.810
But on the other the system here seems intent on keeping the population

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:16.950
under the type of

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:22.129
Authoritarian rule that can only persist in a closed and repressive society

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:30.570
At some point in the near future. I feel the DPRK will have to decide which way it wants to go

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:38.960
Thank you for everything yes. Yes we film stop

00:43:42.339 --> 00:43:49.899
We should all the best oh my anyway, hope to see you

00:43:52.869 --> 00:43:54.200
I

00:43:54.200 --> 00:44:01.240
Would love to show the guides my world to see what they would make of it all for now. That's not possible

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:09.500
But events are moving fast, and I hope positive change is coming to the people of North Korea

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:23.290
Fascinating stuff tomorrow Rob Bell channels his inner child when he rides a miniature train in Sheffield

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:25.989
He knew walking Britain's lost railways at 9:00

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:31.540
Next tonight as a welcome return for some of your favorite ever housemates. It's all getting very

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:34.389
exciting in Big Brother after the Beek

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:43.010
You
