00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.710
This video is a combination of all the parts
from the “All Clone Trooper Types and Variants”

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.130
series for easier viewing.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.790
Because we combined 3 parts into one video,
the list numbering will reset every now and

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.670
then.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.090
First are the standard clone troopers.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.270
They were the most common troopers in the
clone army.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.680
Because they were bred for war, they served
as excellent soldiers and worked extremely

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.020
well with their Jedi allies.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.160
For the first half of the Clone Wars, they
wore standard phase 1 clone armor.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.020
Although this armor provided protection from
the environment and blasters, it was heavy

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.480
and uncomfortable.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.160
This lead to the creation of the phase 2 armor,
which was not only lighter and more comfortable,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.620
but it also provided better protection against
blasters.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:00.010
Standard clone troopers were generally equipped
with the DC-15A blaster rifle or the DC-15S

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.440
blaster.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.780

cold regions, and they were equipped with

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.510
modified armor and equipment that helped them
effectively fight in snow.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.050
Fourth are the clone flame troopers.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:41.260

Sixth are clone scout troopers.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.500
They were used in situations that required
fast-paced combat.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.120
Along with their advanced camouflaged armor,
they wore a body glove that covered their

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.879
neck, legs, and arms, which allowed them to
move quickly.

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.510
Their helmet had a wider visor plate, which
gave them a larger visual area.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.209
Seventh are clone jet troopers, also known
as aerial clone troopers.

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.400

They wore very expensive armor which allowed
them to alter their physical appearance, being

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.329
able to take the appearance of a Hutt Cartel
or Black Sun mercenary.

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:00.099
The armor also reflected scans and could act
as a jamming device.

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.890

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:37.349
parties themselves onto enemy vessels.

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.099
They were equipped with jetpacks and armor
that allowed them to stay in space for long

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.980
periods of time.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.669
Eleventh are the Clone scuba troopers.

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.269
They specialized in underwater combat.

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.400
They wore special armor that was lighter than
regular clone armor and was designed to be

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.599
effective underwater.

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:59.219
They were outfitted with aquatic propulsion
packs on their backs and fins on their feet

to increase agility underwater.

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.819
Their helmets possessed powerful lenses and
sensors to allow them to see through potential

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.219
cloudy water.

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:12.799
Their helmets could extract viable oxygen
from the surrounding water, eliminating the

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.219
need for oxygen tanks.

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:17.950

They were clone commandos who were launched
from orbit in one-man escape pods.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.590
These escape pods would split open when reaching
the target and allow the trooper to descend

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.590
to their target.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.730

There were two different classes of ARC troopers,
The Null-class and Alpha-class.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.970
The Null-class commandos were the first batch
of clones ever created.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.640
Because of this, they were somewhat unstable
and violent.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:30.000
They were supposed to be terminated, but were
saved by Kal Skirata, a another Mandalorian

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.740
trainer, who not only personally trained these
clones, but also later adopted them.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:41.230
The Alpha-class was the successful batch of
ARC trooper clones, as they were stable and

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.580
obedient.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.620
They were very independent thinkers, and would
argue against Jedi orders that they saw as

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.300
incompetent.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:56.370
Many of them even disobeyed order 66, questioning
the legitimacy of Palpatine’s claim of Jedi

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.190
being traitors.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.900
Along with the classes, there were different
variations of ARC troopers.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:08.370
These included the Advanced Recon Commando
heavy gunners, who used high rapid-firing

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:15.430
weapons like the Reciprocating quad blaster
and the Z-6 rotary blaster cannon.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:22.360

missions that included: covert infiltration,
sabotage, demolition, and assassination.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:02.480
They differed from the ARC troopers by wearing
stronger and more advanced armor, and they

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.770

They were specifically trained to combat and
kill Jedi.

00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:37.870
The argument for having these clones in the
army was to use them as a security measure

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:40.969
for if the Jedi ever rebelled against the
Republic.

00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:47.220

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:24.910
They wore regular clone armor that was outfitted
with additional armor padding on their chest

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.199
and shoulder plates.

00:12:27.199 --> 00:12:29.350
Fourth are the clone trooper commanders.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:34.360
They were high ranked clone officers that
lead entire battalions or regiments, which

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:40.939
included 576 or 2,304 other clones respectively.

00:12:40.939 --> 00:12:45.199
Clone commanders generally stayed in the back
of battles and commanded their troops from

00:12:45.199 --> 00:12:49.850
the command centers, only getting involved
in combat when the situation required it.

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:54.379
Initially clone commanders were recognizable
by their yellow markings, but this was later

00:12:54.379 --> 00:13:00.120
changed when clone commanders were assigned
to specific clone divisions.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.720
Fifth are the clone trooper captains.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:08.160
As high ranking officers, they lead entire
clone companies, which included 144 other

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.160
clones.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:14.559
They acted as diverse leaders and fought with
their men in the front lines.

00:13:14.559 --> 00:13:18.839
Initially clone captains were recognizable
by their red markings, but this was later

00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:23.769
changed when clone captains were assigned
to specific clone divisions.

00:13:23.769 --> 00:13:26.120
Sixth are the clone trooper lieutenants.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:30.899
They lead entire platoons, which included
36 other clones.

00:13:30.899 --> 00:13:36.160
As was the same with the other two ranks previously,
clone lieutenants initially were recognizable

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.800
by their blue markings, but this was later
changed when clone lieutenants were assigned

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.570
to specific clone divisions.

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.079
Seventh are the clone trooper sergeants.

00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:49.920
They commanded squads, which included 9 other
clones.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.339
They initially were recognizable by their
olive green markings, but this was later changed

00:13:54.339 --> 00:13:58.629
when clone sergeants were assigned to specific
clone divisions.

00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:01.009
Eighth are the Clone cadets.

00:14:01.009 --> 00:14:03.990
These were clones who were still in combat
training on Kamino.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:08.040
They underwent rigorous training and were
tested by their performance in the battlefield

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.790
simulation rooms.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:14.800
They wore padded clone armor that included
a clear helmet visor.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.459
Ninth are the clone advisors.

00:14:17.459 --> 00:14:23.129
They served as advisors to clone commando
squads, by informing squads about their missions,

00:14:23.129 --> 00:14:25.459
status, and objectives.

00:14:25.459 --> 00:14:28.480
Tenth are the Clone Stormtroopers.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.119
They were the first generation of stormtroopers.

00:14:31.119 --> 00:14:36.759
They initially wore their phase 2 armor, but
it was later replaced with the standard Stormtrooper

00:14:36.759 --> 00:14:38.110
armor.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:43.779
Clone stormtroopers were eventually mostly
replaced by regular human stormtroopers.

00:14:43.779 --> 00:14:46.379
Last are the Anti-troopers.

00:14:46.379 --> 00:14:51.149
They were specifically bred by the Kaminoans
as a private army that they could use to rebel

00:14:51.149 --> 00:14:53.390
against the Galactic Empire.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.470
They wore phase 1 clone armor and were equipped
with jetpacks.

00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:07.909
They were also trained as expert snipers.
