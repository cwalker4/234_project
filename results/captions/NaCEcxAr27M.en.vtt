HAVE A GREAT NIGHT EVERYBODY.

00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:02.667
TUCKER IS UP NEXT.

00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:09.440
♪ ♪

00:00:09.441 --> 00:00:10.107
&gt;&gt; Tucker: GOOD EVENING AND

00:00:10.108 --> 00:00:11.442
WELCOME TO "TUCKER

00:00:11.443 --> 00:00:12.276
CARLSON TONIGHT."

00:00:12.277 --> 00:00:13.644
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS RELEASED

00:00:13.645 --> 00:00:14.845
THEIR OFFER FOR AN IMMIGRATION

00:00:14.846 --> 00:00:15.146
DEAL.

00:00:18.283 --> 00:00:20.351
EVERYTHING THEY SAID THEY

00:00:20.352 --> 00:00:21.218
WANTED.

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:22.653
LEGALIZATION AND A PATH TO

00:00:24.856 --> 00:00:26.390
LAST TO GET HERE WOULD RECEIVE

00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:27.124
AMNESTY.

00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:27.858
VERY FEW OF THE PRESIDENT'S

00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:32.163
AND SOME OF THEM ARE UPSET ABOUT

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:33.431
IT.

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:35.199
THE LEFT, WHAT'S THEIR REACTION

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.700
LIKE?

00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:36.667
HAVING GOTTEN PRETTY MUCH

00:00:36.668 --> 00:00:39.103
EXACTLY WHAT THEY DEMANDED A

00:00:39.104 --> 00:00:39.870
MONTH THEY ARE ENRAGED.

00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:41.472
NOT ONLY IS TRUMPS AMNESTY OFFER

00:00:41.473 --> 00:00:43.641
NOT ENOUGH, THEY SAY, IT IS

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:45.643
EVIDENCE OF A RACIST PLOT.

00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:46.777
ACCORDING TO THE ACLU "THE ONLY

00:00:46.778 --> 00:00:50.614
COMMUNITY THAT BENEFITS FROM A

00:00:50.615 --> 00:00:52.917
SUPPOSED GENEROSITY ARE WAYS OF

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:03.461
THE PLAN PROVED THAT "THE

00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:05.730
CURRENT OPERATING PHILOSOPHY OF

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:06.931
THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE IS

00:01:06.932 --> 00:01:07.932
SUPREMACY."

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:08.766
AT EVAL CALLED THE PROPOSAL A

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:11.102
LEGISLATIVE BURNING CROSS AND

00:01:11.103 --> 00:01:13.804
THE SENIOR DEMOCRAT IN THE HOUSE

00:01:13.805 --> 00:01:17.441
OF REPRESENTATIVES SAID THIS.

00:01:17.442 --> 00:01:19.110
&gt;&gt; LAST NIGHT, THE PRESIDENT PUT

00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:19.844
FORTH A PLAN.

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:23.714
THAT PLAN IS A CAMPAIGN TO MAKE

00:01:23.715 --> 00:01:24.482
AMERICA WHITE AGAIN.

00:01:24.483 --> 00:01:25.583
THEY ARE CHANGING THE CHARACTER

00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:27.551
OF OUR COUNTRY, BUT WHAT THEY

00:01:27.552 --> 00:01:31.589
ARE PUTTING FORTH, THEY BRING A

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.824
TEAR TO THE EYE OF THE STATUE OF

00:01:33.825 --> 00:01:35.493
LIBERTY AND THEY BRING FEAR TO

00:01:35.494 --> 00:01:36.827
THE HEART OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE

00:01:36.828 --> 00:01:39.130
PLAYING BY THE RULES.

00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:40.531
&gt;&gt; Tucker: WE COULD GO ON AND

00:01:40.532 --> 00:01:41.465
ON AND ON.

00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:42.299
IT'S EVERYWHERE TODAY.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.267
YOU SEE THE POINT.

00:01:43.268 --> 00:01:45.469
THEY'RE TELLING YOU THIS PLAN IS

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.570
SOMETHING A PLAN COULD HAVE

00:01:50.642 --> 00:01:51.375
WE TOOK THOSE CHARGES SERIOUSLY

00:01:51.376 --> 00:01:52.510
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD AND

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:54.712
WOULD WE TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT

00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:56.447
WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS ACTUALLY

00:01:56.448 --> 00:01:56.881
PROPOSED.

00:01:56.882 --> 00:01:57.782
WE FOUND THE PLAN WILL BE MANY

00:02:01.253 --> 00:02:01.285
THINGS, NONE OF         NOT ALLT

00:02:01.286 --> 00:02:01.318
THINGS, NONE OF         NOT ALLE

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.452
THINGS, NONE OF         NOT ALLM

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:01.485
THINGS, NONE OF         NOT ALLG

00:02:01.486 --> 00:02:01.519
THINGS, NONE OF         NOT ALLO

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.852
THINGS, NONE OF         NOT ALL,

00:02:01.853 --> 00:02:01.886
THINGS, NONE OF         NOT ALLB

00:02:01.887 --> 00:02:02.153
THINGS, NONE OF         NOT ALLY

00:02:02.154 --> 00:02:03.687
THE WAY.

00:02:03.688 --> 00:02:07.458
BUT IT IS NOT WHITE NATIONALISM.

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:08.859
THE WHITE HOUSE PROPOSAL WOULD

00:02:12.464 --> 00:02:14.899
THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.600
FOR PERSPECTIVE, 13 U.S. STATES

00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:18.903
HAVE POPULATIONS SMALLER THAN

00:02:18.904 --> 00:02:19.303
THAT.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.441
HOW MANY OF THOSE BENEFICIARIES

00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:23.808
ARE WHITE?

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:26.110
KEEP IN MIND, THAT WAS THE

00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:27.411
CENTRAL QUESTION IN ANY PLAN

00:02:27.412 --> 00:02:31.682
CRAFTED BY WHITES PHARMACISTS.

00:02:31.683 --> 00:02:33.284
ALMOST NONE OF THEM.

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:34.652
2 MILLION WERE NONWHITE PEOPLE

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:35.753
IN THIS COUNTRY, THAT'S MORE

00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:36.687
THAN THE TOTAL POPULATION OF

00:02:36.688 --> 00:02:43.894
DELAWARE OR NEBRASKA.

00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:45.863
THE PROPOSAL WOULD ALSO CONTINUE

00:02:48.967 --> 00:02:51.869
IS EXHAUSTED.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.438
WHAT COUNTRIES WILL BE THE TOP

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:55.439
BENEFICIARIES OF THIS NEW

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.475
ARRANGEMENT OVER THE TRUMP PLAN?

00:02:57.476 --> 00:02:59.577
IF YOU GUESS TO FINLAND, NORWAY,

00:02:59.578 --> 00:03:03.681
THOSE SWEDISH NATIONAL TEAM,

00:03:03.682 --> 00:03:04.115
GUESS AGAIN.

00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:12.189
NO EUROPEANS ON THE LIST.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.527
ALSO VIETNAM, BANGLADESH THE

00:03:16.528 --> 00:03:19.263
PLAY WOULD EVEN BRING IN MORE

00:03:19.264 --> 00:03:19.864
THAN 50,000 ADDITIONAL

00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:21.899
IMMIGRANTS FROM HAITI, THE

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.300
COUNTRY THAT THE PRESIDENT

00:03:23.301 --> 00:03:24.135
SUPPOSEDLY HATES.

00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:24.502
SURPRISED?

00:03:24.503 --> 00:03:25.169
YOU SHOULDN'T BE.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.538
NO MATTER WHAT THEY'RE TELLING

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:29.673
YOU ON TELEVISION, NO MAJORITY

00:03:29.674 --> 00:03:30.374
WHITE COUNTRIES HAD LARGE

00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:31.342
NUMBERS OF IMMIGRANTS TO THE

00:03:31.343 --> 00:03:32.376
UNITED STATES.

00:03:32.377 --> 00:03:34.345
THEY HAVEN'T IN 50 YEARS TO.

00:03:34.346 --> 00:03:36.447
THAT WILL CHANGE UNDER THIS

00:03:36.448 --> 00:03:36.814
PROPOSAL.

00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:42.253
A WHITE NATIONALIST PLOT?

00:03:42.254 --> 00:03:45.256
THAT MAY BE THE DUMBEST AND MOST

00:03:45.257 --> 00:03:46.590
DISHONEST TALKING POINTS AT ALL.

00:03:46.591 --> 00:03:47.591
IT'S POISONOUS AND IT MAKES

00:03:53.932 --> 00:03:54.498
THEMSELVES.

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:55.666
OF COURSE, THEY'RE NOT.

00:03:59.638 --> 00:04:00.471
LYING.

00:04:00.472 --> 00:04:01.305
MAYBE THEY'VE CONVINCED

00:04:01.306 --> 00:04:02.573
THEMSELVES THAT RHETORIC IS

00:04:02.574 --> 00:04:02.873
TRUE.

00:04:02.874 --> 00:04:03.574
IT'S POSSIBLE THE DEMOCRATIC

00:04:06.378 --> 00:04:08.479
THEIR NEW POSITION AS IT IS IS

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.880
IT'S IMMORAL TO RESTRICT ANY

00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:11.348
KIND OF IMMIGRATION FROM ANY

00:04:14.853 --> 00:04:16.487
EVEN ENFORCING OUR OWN EXISTING

00:04:16.488 --> 00:04:18.689
LAWS, THE ONES THAT THEY VOTED

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.659
FOR AND PASSED IN CONGRESS IS

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.194
NOW AMOUNTED TO A HATE CRIME.

00:04:27.132 --> 00:04:29.667
OF THE SO BY DEFINITION,

00:04:29.668 --> 00:04:30.734
DEMOCRATS ARE EXTREMISTS ON THE

00:04:32.103 --> 00:04:33.504
THIS IS THEIR NEW ELECTORAL

00:04:33.505 --> 00:04:34.271
STRATEGY.

00:04:34.272 --> 00:04:35.206
THESE ARE THEIR NEW VOTERS.

00:04:47.686 --> 00:04:48.219
&gt;&gt; THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON AGAI

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.652
AGAIN.

00:04:48.653 --> 00:04:49.987
&gt;&gt; Tucker: THERE MAY BE THINGS

00:04:49.988 --> 00:04:51.388
ABOUT THIS PLAN YOU DON'T LIKE,

00:04:56.595 --> 00:04:57.995
GIVES A LEGALIZATION AND AMNESTY

00:04:57.996 --> 00:04:58.862
IN THE PATH OF CITIZENSHIP FOR

00:04:58.863 --> 00:05:00.764
MORE THAN 2 MILLION PEOPLE HERE

00:05:00.765 --> 00:05:03.934
ILLEGALLY, NONE OF THEM WHITE IS

00:05:03.935 --> 00:05:05.102
WHITE THE PREMISES.

00:05:05.103 --> 00:05:07.905
HOW DOES THAT WORK?

00:05:07.906 --> 00:05:09.306
SPEAK UP WE HAVE TO TAKE A STEP

00:05:09.307 --> 00:05:10.507
BACK AND LOOK AT THIS FROM THE

00:05:10.508 --> 00:05:10.874
BEGINNING.

00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:14.211
THE REASON WE ARE IN THIS CHAOS

00:05:14.212 --> 00:05:15.479
OF YOUNG PEOPLE'S LIVES BEING ON

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.648
THE LINE IS BECAUSE THE

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:20.517
PRESIDENT RESCINDED DACA, THE

00:05:20.518 --> 00:05:21.885
PROGRAM THAT GAVE UNDOCUMENTED

00:05:21.886 --> 00:05:22.953
YOUNG PEOPLE WORK TO GO TO

00:05:22.954 --> 00:05:25.489
SCHOOL AND DRIVE AND PAY TAXES.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.657
HE ENDED THAT PROGRAM AND THAT

00:05:26.658 --> 00:05:33.964
IS WHY WE ARE IN THIS SITUATION.

00:05:33.965 --> 00:05:34.431
&gt;&gt; Martha: STOP.

00:05:34.432 --> 00:05:39.103
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU A QUESTION.

00:05:39.104 --> 00:05:40.504
&gt;&gt; IT'S MY TURN TO SPEAK.

00:05:40.505 --> 00:05:41.505
&gt;&gt; Martha: I DON'T BELIEVE IT

00:05:41.506 --> 00:05:41.872
IS.

00:05:41.873 --> 00:05:43.274
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE

00:05:43.275 --> 00:05:44.375
DISCUSSION TODAY, NOT ABOUT THE

00:05:44.376 --> 00:05:45.542
ROOTS OF DACA WHICH I'M HAPPY TO

00:05:45.543 --> 00:05:47.278
DEBATE WITH YOU AND SOME OTHER

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:48.112
FORM.

00:05:52.684 --> 00:05:53.217
IS WHITE SUPREMACY.

00:05:53.218 --> 00:05:56.253
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL ME --

00:05:56.254 --> 00:05:58.289
&gt;&gt; I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU AN

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:59.356
ANSWER IF YOU WOULD LET ME.

00:05:59.357 --> 00:06:00.624
&gt;&gt; Martha: IF YOU COULD GIVE

00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:01.692
ME A CRISP ANSWER AND NOT

00:06:01.693 --> 00:06:07.531
FILIBUSTER, I'D APPRECIATE IT.

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:12.303
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO HOLD

00:06:12.304 --> 00:06:13.871
HOSTAGE AND USE AS BARGAINING

00:06:13.872 --> 00:06:15.539
CHIPS THE LIVES OF 8,000

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.474
UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE WHO HAVE

00:06:17.475 --> 00:06:19.476
BEEN HERE THEIR ENTIRE LIVES WHO

00:06:19.477 --> 00:06:21.111
ARE AMERICAN AND EVERY SINGLE

00:06:21.112 --> 00:06:22.813
WAY AND NOW, WHAT WE ARE TRYING

00:06:22.814 --> 00:06:24.348
TO DO IS TO CREATE A

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:26.417
SECOND-CLASS CITIZEN.

00:06:26.418 --> 00:06:31.288
THAT'S WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES.

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:33.290
&gt;&gt; Martha: CAN YOU ANSWER THE

00:06:35.927 --> 00:06:36.593
HERE ILLEGALLY AMNESTY AND A

00:06:36.594 --> 00:06:37.294
PATH TO CITIZENSHIP WHICH IS

00:06:37.295 --> 00:06:38.996
WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR

00:06:38.997 --> 00:06:41.498
AND RECALLING THAT WHITES OF

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:48.205
THOSE WORDS ARE NOT COME OUT OF

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:57.281
PLAN, WHAT IT DOES, IT CREATES A

00:06:57.282 --> 00:06:58.315
SECOND-CLASS CITIZEN BECAUSE IT

00:06:58.316 --> 00:07:00.250
SAYS THAT THE DREAMERS CAN

00:07:00.251 --> 00:07:02.453
BECOME CITIZENS THEMSELVES, BUT

00:07:02.454 --> 00:07:03.354
THEY CANNOT SPONSOR THEIR

00:07:06.691 --> 00:07:07.758
THOSE RIGHTS ARE DIFFERENT THAN

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:08.559
THE RIGHTS THAT YOU HAVE AND YOU

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.295
JUST SAID EARLIER THAT THIS

00:07:11.296 --> 00:07:12.563
PLAN, THE 2 MILLION PEOPLE, THAT

00:07:12.564 --> 00:07:14.498
NONE OF THEM ARE WHITE, WHICH IS

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:15.466
UNTRUE BECAUSE THERE ARE

00:07:15.467 --> 00:07:17.267
UNDOCUMENTED WHITE PEOPLE.

00:07:17.268 --> 00:07:18.936
THERE ARE 50,000 UNDOCUMENTED

00:07:18.937 --> 00:07:20.971
IRISH PEOPLE LIVING IN

00:07:20.972 --> 00:07:22.106
NEW YORK CITY.

00:07:22.107 --> 00:07:23.474
&gt;&gt; Martha: YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:07:23.475 --> 00:07:26.510
THEY'RE NOT COVERED BY THIS.

00:07:26.511 --> 00:07:27.711
THAT'S MY ONLY POINT.

00:07:27.712 --> 00:07:28.479
SPEAK OUT THERE ARE DREAMERS WHO

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.182
ARE WHITE.

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:38.889
RACE OF THE DREAMERS.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:39.890
I DO BELIEVE YOU.

00:07:39.891 --> 00:07:41.592
MY ONLY POINT IS THE WAY YOU'RE

00:07:41.593 --> 00:07:43.894
SEEING IT TODAY IS NOT AN

00:07:43.895 --> 00:07:44.695
EXPRESSION OF WHITES PREMISES SO

00:07:44.696 --> 00:07:45.796
I WISH YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS

00:07:45.797 --> 00:07:47.498
WOULD START MAKING THAT POINT

00:07:47.499 --> 00:07:48.899
BECAUSE IT'S A LIE AND IT'S

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:49.500
DIVISIVE.

00:07:49.501 --> 00:07:50.768
THAT'S MY ONLY POINT BECAUSE IS

00:07:50.769 --> 00:07:52.536
NOT TRUE.

00:07:52.537 --> 00:07:53.637
AND MAKES PEOPLE HATE EACH

00:07:53.638 --> 00:07:53.937
OTHER.

00:07:59.377 --> 00:08:02.880
WHO ARE MOSTLY PEOPLE OF COLOR

00:08:05.583 --> 00:08:12.222
THAT IS RACIST.

00:08:12.223 --> 00:08:16.760
&gt;&gt; Tucker: YOU HAVE THE

00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:20.864
COUNTRY ILLEGALLY AS YOU DEAD.

00:08:20.865 --> 00:08:23.867
&gt;&gt; I CAME ON A TOURIST VISA.

00:08:23.868 --> 00:08:25.869
I DO NOT COME ILLEGALLY.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:26.503
&gt;&gt; Tucker: I MISUNDERSTOOD

00:08:37.882 --> 00:08:39.283
&gt;&gt; Tucker: SO YOU WERE HERE

00:08:39.284 --> 00:08:39.650
ILLEGALLY.

00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:43.287
THAT'S WHAT I JUST SAID.

00:08:43.288 --> 00:08:43.987
YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE PARENTS

00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:54.898
A CITIZEN.

00:08:54.899 --> 00:08:56.700
&gt;&gt; I'M NOW A U.S. CITIZEN AND IF

00:08:56.701 --> 00:08:58.702
I WANT MY MOTHER TO BE ABLE TO

00:08:58.703 --> 00:08:59.903
COME VISIT ME AND TO BE ABLE TO

00:08:59.904 --> 00:09:03.240
COME BE WITH ME AS A

00:09:04.576 --> 00:09:09.880
YOU HAVE THAT RIGHT.

00:09:09.881 --> 00:09:11.281
&gt;&gt; Tucker: YOU SNEAK INTO THE

00:09:13.818 --> 00:09:15.118
NOW YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO

00:09:15.119 --> 00:09:16.119
CITIZENSHIP BECAUSE WERE THE ONE

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.489
WHO CAUSED THIS PROBLEM, THAT

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:19.723
PARENT IN THE FIRST PLACE BY

00:09:19.724 --> 00:09:22.526
BRINGING OUR CHILD HERE

00:09:24.963 --> 00:09:28.899
WHY SHOULD I BE FOR THAT?

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:29.766
SPEAK OUT ROLLING BACK TO THE

00:09:29.767 --> 00:09:30.400
POINT I WAS MAKING AT THE

00:09:30.401 --> 00:09:33.270
BEGINNING OF THE SEGMENT --

00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:33.871

00:09:33.872 --> 00:09:34.972

SPEAK OF THE PRESIDENT ENDED

00:09:43.147 --> 00:09:43.547
THAT DEBATE.

00:09:43.548 --> 00:09:46.717
YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING MY QUESTION

00:09:46.718 --> 00:09:47.451
YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING MY QUESTIO

00:09:47.452 --> 00:09:48.285
QUESTION.

00:09:48.286 --> 00:09:50.287
YOU'RE SAYING IF I SNEAK INTO

00:09:52.123 --> 00:09:54.191
COUNTRY ARE KIND ENOUGH TO GIVE

00:09:54.192 --> 00:09:57.895
THAT CHILD CITIZENSHIP.

00:09:57.896 --> 00:09:58.896
IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION, WHY

00:09:58.897 --> 00:10:01.465
DON'T YOU GIVE ME A SIMPLE

00:10:01.466 --> 00:10:02.266

SPEAK OF THE REASON WHY IS AS

00:10:05.703 --> 00:10:06.670
THE PEOPLE

00:10:06.671 --> 00:10:07.204
BECOME UNITED STATES

00:10:07.205 --> 00:10:10.841
CITIZENS, THEY SHOULD HAVE THE

00:10:10.842 --> 00:10:13.143
RIGHTS OF ANY OTHER AMERICAN

00:10:13.144 --> 00:10:13.510
CITIZEN.

00:10:13.511 --> 00:10:14.578
WHY SHOULD THIS PERSON IF WE'RE

00:10:14.579 --> 00:10:19.883
MAKING THEM CITIZENS --

00:10:19.884 --> 00:10:20.551
&gt;&gt; Tucker: BECAUSE YOU CAME

00:10:20.552 --> 00:10:22.386
HERE ILLEGALLY AND WE DON'T WANT

00:10:22.387 --> 00:10:25.656
TO APPROVE THAT BEHAVIOR.

00:10:25.657 --> 00:10:27.491
LET ME ASK YOU REALLY QUICK.

00:10:27.492 --> 00:10:30.260
THE ACLU DESCRIBED THIS AS A

00:10:35.733 --> 00:10:37.401
CITIZENSHIP TO PEOPLE WHO CAME

&gt;&gt; Tucker: I'M ASKING YOU A

00:10:45.977 --> 00:10:46.877
SIMPLE QUESTION.

00:10:46.878 --> 00:10:49.646
IS IT GENEROUS TO GET PEOPLE WHO

00:10:52.116 --> 00:10:54.451
