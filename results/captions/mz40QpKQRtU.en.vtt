00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:03.102
-President Trump is desperate

00:00:03.102 --> 00:00:05.138
to get involved in
the 2020 Democratic primary.

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:06.272
and he's attacking everyone,

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:07.874
from the candidates
to Spike Lee.

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:10.209
For more on this, it's time
for "A Closer Look."

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.347
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:16.482
Trump demands
constant attention,

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:18.384
and he can't let anyone else
have the spotlight.

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:19.185
It's exhausting.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.620
He's like the older sibling

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.921
who's jealous of the new baby.

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:24.390
If you spend five minutes
paying attention to anyone else,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.761
you'll turn around and see him
stuffing crayons in his mouth.

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:30.530
For example,
last night's Oscar ceremony

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.398
did not mention Trump
by name once.

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:34.333
The closest anyone came
was Spike Lee

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.370
mentioning the 2020 election
in his acceptance speech.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.207
-The 2020 presidential election
is around the corner!

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:44.043
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.645
Let's all mobilize.

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:48.714
Let's all be
in the right side of history.

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:51.450
Make the moral choice

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.619
between love versus hate.

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:55.488
-I love that he didn't
mention Trump by name,

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:59.091
but Trump heard hate
and assumed it was about him.

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:00.759
When Trump hears
the word "hate,"

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:02.228
it's like his bat signal.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:03.762
[ As Donald Trump ]
Someone said the word "hate"!

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:06.566
Alfred, get me my Twitter belt!

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.934
[ Laughter ]

[ Normal voice ]
And once again --

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:11.904
Once again...
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:14.140
...Trump had to elbow his way
into the spotlight,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.075
Lashing out at Spike Lee
on Twitter.

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:17.510
-He said --
He tweeted this out.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.446
"Be nice if Spike Lee
could read his notes,

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:22.915
or better yet,

when doing his racist hit
on your president,

for African-Americans --

criminal justice reform,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.189
lowest unemployment numbers
in history,

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.159
tax cuts, et cetera --
than almost any other pres!"

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.362
-I'm sorry -- Are you
really calling someone else

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:38.598
a racist who can't read notes?

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:39.932
[ Laughter ]

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:41.967
Every time you read
off a teleprompter,

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:45.571
you sound like an Amazon Echo
that fell in the toilet.

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:49.241
-Our hope is a word and world

00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:50.809
through their lives

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:53.445
and though their lives...

00:01:53.445 --> 00:01:56.983

for the furniture --

[ Laughter ]
...of their children.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:01.588
Controlled by large "jearners,"

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:05.725
10,000 known or "suspested"
gang members.

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:07.960
-Ah, yes, "suspested" --

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.730
as in, "I watched the
president's press conference

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:14.500
and 'suspested'
he was having a stroke."

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.769
Trump can't stand
any mention of 2020

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:17.803
without getting involved.

00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:19.672
For example,
CNN reported on Friday

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:21.440
that he's already
planning on wading in

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.542
to the 2020 Democratic primary.

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:25.711
Even though the first votes
are still a year away,

00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:28.747
Trump reportedly wants to
sow division among Democrats.

00:02:28.747 --> 00:02:32.084
-New reporting from CNN
shows Trump is eager to play

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:34.987
a disruptive role in
the Democratic primary.

00:02:34.987 --> 00:02:38.457
And in the words of one adviser,
his team is looking for ways

00:02:38.457 --> 00:02:41.827
to cause chaos
from the left and right.

00:02:41.827 --> 00:02:44.697
One Republican who speaks
to him often tells CNN,

00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:47.199
the president wants
to get into the game.

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.535
People may knock him in terms
of running the government,

00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:53.306
but he gets the campaign
and can't wait to get started.

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:55.842
-It's like the tagline
for a new sitcom --

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.978
"He's bad at government,
but great at causing chaos.

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:02.848
Tune in this fall for
'The President is a Cat.'"

00:03:02.848 --> 00:03:05.751
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:08.254
Even...

00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:10.423
Even Trump's advisers admit

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:11.890
he's bad at running
the government,

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.659
but he's good at causing chaos.

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.361
I wish I had been there
for that strategy meeting.

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:17.029
"Okay, guys, on this side,
we have weaknesses --

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:19.065
running the government,
foreign policy, domestic policy,

spelling, and speaking --

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:22.535
and on this side,
we have strengths --

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:26.172
chaos --
so we're gonna go with that."

00:03:26.172 --> 00:03:28.173
The only part of the job
Trump likes is campaigning.

00:03:28.173 --> 00:03:29.208
In fact, on Saturday,

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:31.043
he seemed jealous
of all the attention

00:03:31.043 --> 00:03:32.512
the 2020 Democrats
have been getting

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:34.514
and decided to weigh in,
tweeting, "There is far more

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:36.815
energy on the right
than there is on the left."

00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:39.818
Trump definitely doesn't have
more energy than the Democrats.

00:03:39.818 --> 00:03:41.621
He doesn't have more energy
than anyone.

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:42.922
You hardly ever see him walking.

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:45.858
His favorite hobby is a game
where you hit a ball

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:48.361
and then you drive
to wherever it lands.

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:52.731

after Bernie Sanders
officially joined

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:56.368

Now, you might remember
the first time Bernie ran.

00:03:58.904 --> 00:04:02.742
In 2015, he did so with
a typical pomp and fanfare

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:04.444

a brief comment,

to take a few questions.

how to do it without
any podium at all.

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:17.770
You want to talk about
health care, gun control,

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.038
the environment,
but the end of the day,

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:21.841
most Americans just want
to get some ranch.

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:23.309
[ Laughter ]

00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:25.444
I mean, you could probably...

00:07:25.444 --> 00:07:28.114
you could probably make
a pretty good showing

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:31.116
running on
a condiment-only platform.

00:07:31.116 --> 00:07:34.219
If elected, I guarantee
all mustards will be full

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:36.188
so you never again have to hear

00:07:36.188 --> 00:07:38.457
that empty-mustard
farting sound!

00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:40.660
[ Imitates empty bottle ]

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.194
[ Laughter ]

00:07:42.194 --> 00:07:43.696
[ Light applause ]

00:07:43.696 --> 00:07:45.864
The Yellow Party!

00:07:45.864 --> 00:07:47.967
The Democratic candidates
are also debating key issues

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:50.169
voters care about, like,
for example, climate change,

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:51.637
and the timing cannot
be more urgent.

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:53.939
On Friday, Trump announced
he was nominating

00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:55.874
his new ambassador
to the United Nation,

00:07:55.874 --> 00:07:58.143
a GOP donor named Kelly Craft

00:07:58.143 --> 00:08:00.479
who won't even say if
climate change is real.

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:03.449
Here she is being asked
that question in 2017.

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:06.018
-You know,
there are good sciences

00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:07.919
on both issues.

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:09.555
And I believe that
we are committed

00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:10.789
to our environment.

00:08:10.789 --> 00:08:13.693
Obviously, there are a lot
of people on this Earth,

00:08:13.693 --> 00:08:16.195
and that is going to be a result

00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:19.164
of some of the damages
to the planet.

00:08:19.164 --> 00:08:21.167
-Do you, yourself, believe
in climate change?

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:24.070
-I believe there are
sciences on both sides

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.571
that are accurate.

00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:27.373
-You believe that
there's scientists --

00:08:27.373 --> 00:08:28.740
science that proves
that there is --

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.476
man is not causing
climate change?

00:08:30.476 --> 00:08:32.077
-Well, I think
that both sides have --

00:08:32.077 --> 00:08:35.681
You know, they have
their own results

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:38.184
from their studies,
and I appreciate,

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:41.820
and I respect both sides
of the science.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.422
-She sounds like a sixth grader

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:46.425
who forgot to do a project
for the science fair.

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:47.993
Also, there are not both sides.

00:08:47.993 --> 00:08:49.928
There's one side with all
the world's scientists on it,

00:08:49.928 --> 00:08:51.964
and then there's the other side,
which is just Donald Trump,

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:53.732
and I assure you
he's not sitting there

00:08:53.732 --> 00:08:56.101
in a lab coat and goggles,
studying computer models

00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:57.769
and cranking out reports.

00:08:57.769 --> 00:08:59.271
-[ As Donald Trump ]
Eureka! I've got it!

00:08:59.271 --> 00:09:01.774
I learned how to spell
"hamburger"!

00:09:01.774 --> 00:09:03.108
[ Laughter ]

00:09:03.108 --> 00:09:04.643
[ Normal voice ]
Climate change will be one

00:09:04.643 --> 00:09:06.745
of several major issues
in the 2020 campaign,

00:09:06.745 --> 00:09:08.213
and they already
have Democrats energized.

00:09:08.213 --> 00:09:10.449
Trump is desperate
to cause chaos,

00:09:10.449 --> 00:09:12.485
because it's the only thing
he's good at.

00:09:12.485 --> 00:09:14.152
Meanwhile,
most voters are saying...

00:09:14.152 --> 00:09:15.554
-I'm just trying
to get some ranch.

00:09:15.554 --> 00:09:17.990
-This has been "A Closer Look."

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.859
