( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
( PIANO RIFF )

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:06.539
WERE WE TALKING ABOUT THAT?

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:06.973 size:78% position:39%
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

00:00:06.973 --> 00:00:12.312 align:start size:88% position:13%

ADMINISTRATION?

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:17.650
SEVEN MONTHS AGO, SOMETHING LIKE

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.819
JIM, DO WE HAVE A PICTURE OF
WHAT I LOOKED LIKE BACK THEN?

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:22.655 align:start size:88% position:13%
THERE YOU GO.

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:22.856 align:start size:88% position:13%
YEAH.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.825
YOU'LL RECALL THAT IN THE FIRST
WEEK, BACK WHEN WE WERE GIVING

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:28.261
HIM A CHANCE, TRUMP WAS CALLING
ALL THE WORLD LEADERS, YOU KNOW,

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:32.599
GETTING TO KNOW THEM.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.301 align:start size:88% position:13%
"HI, HELLO.

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:35.468 align:start size:88% position:13%

I LIKE TO EAT STEAK.

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:40.740
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.577 align:start size:88% position:13%

HELLO?"
( PIANO RIFF )

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.381
( LAUGHTER )
TWO OF THE CALLS WERE WITH THE

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:50.116 size:88% position:56%
PRESIDENT OF MEXICO AND THE
PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA.

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:51.851
RUMOR IS, THE CALLS DID NOT GO
WELL.

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:55.255
FIRST, TRUMP TALKED TO MEXICAN
PRESIDENT ENRIQUE PEÑA NIETO

00:00:55.255 --> 00:01:00.293
AND, WENT HE GOT OFF THE PHONE,
SAID, "GREAT NEWS, THEY'RE

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:03.463
PAYING FOR THE WALL."

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:12.138
BUT PEÑA NIETO SAID, "QUE ESTAS
HABLANDO, WILLIS?"

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:15.075 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERING )

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:19.746 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT YOU TALKING
ABOUT, WILLIS?

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:22.148 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WILLIS KNOW
SPANISH?

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:24.984 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
SO, WHO DO YOU BELIEVE?

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:25.718
THE GUY WHO DENIED IT?

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.120
OR THE GUY WHO WAS LYING?

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.458
THERE WAS NO WAY TO KNOW-- UNTIL
THIS MORNING, WHEN THE

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:34.928 align:end position:100%
"WASHINGTON POST" PUBLISHED FULL
TRANSCRIPTS OF TRUMP'S CALLS

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:39.999
WITH THE LEADERS OF MEXICO AND
AUSTRALIA.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.300 align:start size:88% position:13%
OKAY?

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.368
MEXICO AND AUSTRALIA.

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:48.575
OR AS TRUMP REFERS TO THEM, "BAD
HOMBRESTAN" AND "KOALA LAMPUR."

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:51.211 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( PIANO RIFF )

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:58.551 size:88% position:56%
THAT'S WHERE THAT IS, RIGHT?

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:01.521
NOW, THESE TRANSCRIPTS SHOULD
NOT HAVE BEEN LEAKED.

00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:04.357
THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING THE
PRESIDENT CAN SAY TO OTHER WORLD

00:02:04.357 --> 00:02:09.195
LEADERS WHERE HE CAN SPEAK
FRANKLY OR NOTHING CAN GET DONE.

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:11.531
SO BAD LEAKER, SHOULDN'T HAVE
DONE IT.

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:15.668
BUT YOU DID, SO LET'S JUST KEEP
GOING.

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:19.873
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, WITH MEXICAN PRESIDENT PEÑA

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:22.342 size:88% position:56%
NIETO, TRUMP SHOWED THAT HE
REALLY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:24.210 align:end position:100%
WALL, SAYING, "BELIEVE IT OR
NOT, THIS IS THE LEAST IMPORTANT

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.982 size:88% position:56%
THING WE ARE TALKING ABOUT."

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:31.751 size:78% position:39%
OH, I BELIEVE IT.

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:33.586
BECAUSE PEÑA NIETO SAID THIS:
"MY POSITION HAS BEEN AND WILL

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:35.922
CONTINUE TO BE VERY FIRM, SAYING
THAT MEXICO CANNOT PAY FOR THAT

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:37.624 align:start size:88% position:13%
WALL."

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:39.993
"BUT YOU CANNOT SAY THAT TO THE
PRESS.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:42.362
THE PRESS IS GOING TO GO WITH
THAT AND I CANNOT LIVE WITH

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:43.763 align:start size:88% position:13%
THAT.

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:49.669 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU CANNOT SAY THAT TO THE
PRESS."

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.671 align:start size:88% position:13%
( AUDIENCE REACTS )
NO, LISTEN --

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:52.906 size:88% position:44%
"HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:54.674
JUST LIE TO THEM AND, LATER WHEN
YOU'RE CAUGHT, CALL IT FAKE

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:57.477 align:start size:88% position:13%
NEWS.

00:02:57.477 --> 00:03:00.146 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT WORKS."

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:01.714
( LAUGHTER )
THEN, TRUMP TRIED TO CONVINCE

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:05.518
PEÑA NIETO THAT THE WALL WAS HIS
PROBLEM TOO.

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:08.922
"THE FACT IS WE ARE BOTH IN A
LITTLE BIT OF A POLITICAL BIND

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:16.529
BECAUSE I HAVE TO HAVE MEXICO
PAY FOR THE WALL-- I HAVE TO."

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:17.430
( LAUGHTER )
YES, THEY WERE BOTH IN A BIND.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.300
TRUMP NEEDS MEXICO TO PAY FOR
THE WALL, AND PEÑA NIETO NEEDS

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.903
TO GET HIS ENTIRE STAFF IN HERE
QUICK TO LISTEN TO THIS.

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:29.175 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( PIANO RIFF )

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:32.612 align:start size:88% position:13%
SAY IT AGAIN!

( PIANO RIFF )
( LAUGHTER )

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:41.020
THEN TRUMP STARTING TALKING
SMACK ABOUT AMERICA: "I WON NEW

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.659
HAMPSHIRE BECAUSE NEW HAMPSHIRE
IS A DRUG-INFESTED DEN."

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.996 align:start size:88% position:13%
( AUDIENCE REACTS )
NO, NO, LISTEN!

00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:52.832
YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE IT TO HIM.

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:56.603
IT'S RIGHT THERE ON THE WELCOME
SIGN --

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:58.905 align:start size:88% position:13%
WELCOME TO NEW HAMPSHIRE: A
DRUG-INFESTED DEN.

00:03:58.905 --> 00:03:59.706 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
HEY, DONALD, YOU'RE THE

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:00.340
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES!

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.074
IT'S LIKE BEING A PARENT.

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:02.942
YOU HAVE TO LOVE ALL THE STATES
EQUALLY, EVEN IF ONE OF THEM IS

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:06.012 align:start size:88% position:13%
ERIC.

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:10.250 align:start size:88% position:13%
( LAUGHTER )
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.488 size:81% position:41%
AND NEW HAMPSHIRE?

00:04:15.488 --> 00:04:15.655 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHY?

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:21.828 align:start size:88% position:13%
I DON'T -- IN SUMMATION, HE
LIED -- AGAIN.

00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:29.535
THE NEXT DAY TRUMP HAD A CALL
WITH AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:31.638
AND GUY EXPLAINING THE REVERSE
TOILET WATER THING FOR THE LAST

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:32.505 size:88% position:56%

PRIME MINISTER ON THE PHONE
CALL.

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:37.577 align:end position:100%
TRUMP VEHEMENTLY DENIED THIS
STORY: "WE HAD A GREAT TELEPHONE

CALL.

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.015
YOU GUYS EXAGGERATED THAT CALL.

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:44.450 size:88% position:56%
THAT WAS A BIG EXAGGERATION.

THAT CALL AND... HE LIED AGAIN.

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:13.479
BECAUSE TRUMP WAS REALLY UPSET
ON THE PHONE CALL ABOUT A DEAL

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.382
PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE ABOUT
ACCEPTING REFUGEES WHO WERE

00:05:16.382 --> 00:05:20.119
WAITING IN AUSTRALIA, SAYING,
"MALCOLM, WHY IS THIS SO

IMPORTANT?

00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:23.056 size:88% position:44%
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:25.625
THIS IS GOING TO KILL ME.

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:28.227
I AM THE WORLD'S GREATEST PERSON
THAT DOES NOT WANT TO LET PEOPLE

WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.510
IS HE THE WORLD'S GREATEST

OR IS HE THE WORLD'S GREATEST
PERSON AT KEEPING THEM OUT?

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.981 align:start size:88% position:13%
