00:00:09.212 --> 00:00:10.162
CARSON: Okay.

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:11.581
Okay, we're back.

00:00:17.708 --> 00:00:21.828
CARSON: You know, in this business, there are comedians, there are comics, and once in a while - rarely -

00:00:21.828 --> 00:00:26.780
somebody rises above and supersedes that and becomes a comic persona unto themselves.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.786
I never cease to be amazed at the versatility and the wonderful work that Robin Williams does.

00:00:31.786 --> 00:00:33.982
Would you welcome him please?  Robin Williams.

00:00:49.083 --> 00:00:52.888
WILLIAMS: I brought you a little something.
CARSON: You've got to be kidding.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.330
WILLIAMS: A little something from the Elvis estate.

00:00:57.826 --> 00:00:59.695
A little something here.  It's nice.

00:00:59.695 --> 00:01:03.658
CARSON: Just, can I try?  Should I try?
WILLIAMS: Please, just sit on down and we'll give you a piÃ±a colonic.

00:01:05.854 --> 00:01:08.290
There you are.
CARSON: Oh God.

00:01:10.556 --> 00:01:12.900
WILLIAMS: There we go.
CARSON: Can I sit in the sun today?

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.220
WILLIAMS: We're going to Spago.
CARSON: Spago!

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.888
WILLIAMS: Don't be afraid.  I've also bought you the new L.A. medic alert.

00:01:20.888 --> 00:01:24.072
It says, "I've fallen and get the hell away from me."

00:01:25.926 --> 00:01:27.070
A little gift.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.427
CARSON: Oh, isn't that nice.  A rocking chair.

00:01:30.427 --> 00:01:31.938
WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's the simple things.  I got you a bunch of stuff.

00:01:31.938 --> 00:01:34.506
Yeah, it's the little stuff to get you in your new life.

00:01:34.506 --> 00:01:38.244
CARSON: Oh, come on.  Hey thank you for coming on.  I really mean it.

00:01:38.244 --> 00:01:40.596
WILLIAMS: This is a wild night, especially with the world in such interesting--

00:01:40.596 --> 00:01:43.610
I was going to bring you a VCR, but the stores had none.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.089
CARSON: A little low, are they?
WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:52.618
Somebody I guess had done a little politcal shopping.

00:01:53.272 --> 00:01:55.880
It's very difficult.  You see people going, "Yeah man!"

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.470
"It's for Rodney King!  And the five TVs are for me."

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.414
Yeah, they caught the one guy.  They always catch the one whino.

00:02:04.414 --> 00:02:09.732
"All right, yeah, man.  I'm really pissed off about Don King."

00:02:12.785 --> 00:02:17.488
"The Don King thing has got me down, man."
"Damn."

00:02:17.488 --> 00:02:19.006
And they brought in the National Guard.

00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:22.572
They didn't come with bullets, which is always an interesting thing.

00:02:22.572 --> 00:02:24.068
CARSON: They couldn't find them.
WILLIAMS: They couldn't find them.

00:02:24.068 --> 00:02:28.810
So they're out in the streets going, "Hey everybody.  We are the world."

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.548
It's a difficult thing.
CARSON: Ah, yeah.  But you know.

00:02:34.548 --> 00:02:38.574
WILLIAMS: They said they saw BMWs pulling up to the Radio Shack.  That must be great.

00:02:38.574 --> 00:02:43.317
"This is fabulous.  This is great."

00:02:43.317 --> 00:02:48.090
"I wonder if we can get store credit if you don't already have it."

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.450
CARSON: Oh God.  I said last night, thank God for Qualye.
He kept us alive for two more nights.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.766
WILLIAMS: Oh yeah, Quayle.

00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:55.940
They sent him down to the hood.  That was great.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.734
Yeah, he thinks he's now a homie right now.

00:02:58.734 --> 00:03:03.399
Yeah, Dan, hangin'.  "Look it's boys in the hood."

00:03:04.458 --> 00:03:10.080
"Hi there.  You have got to chill.  Yeah, yeah.  This is real def."

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.670
"Hold it right--  Woah.  What it is, what it was."

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.414
"Oh man, you dumb."

00:03:17.414 --> 00:03:20.234
The guy, the guy is--  He's one taco short of a combination plate.

00:03:26.712 --> 00:03:29.670
It's amazing.  I really, I think that they told him about the Murphy Brown thing.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.810
I think George said, "All right.  Here's the deal."

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.022
"I want you to go out there and talk about Jerry Brown."

00:03:41.188 --> 00:03:43.196
"Jerry Brown.  Jerry Brown.  Jerry Brown."

00:03:43.196 --> 00:03:46.483
"Buster Brown.  Buster Brown.  Buster Brown.
Buster Brown.  Buster Brown."

00:03:46.483 --> 00:03:48.616
"Audie Murphy.  Audie Murphy.  Audie Murphy.  Audie Murph--"

00:03:48.616 --> 00:03:53.794
"Murphy Brown!  Murphy Brown make me so--  Don't you hear that!  That he's rain man!"

00:03:56.044 --> 00:03:59.220
CARSON: 162, 163...

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.681
WILLIAMS: "He's basically--  Hey Dan, you want to be president?  "Yeah.  Five minutes to Murphy Brown.  Yeah."

00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:07.006
"Do you want to fly up to the coast?"

00:04:07.006 --> 00:04:09.918
"Yeah.  Air Force One.  Safest plane.  Never crashed.  Never crashed."

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.850
"Yeah, yeah.  That'd be good.  Yeah."

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.966
It's amazing.  He's the greatest insurance in the world.
Just when someone's going, "I'm gonna get that George--"

00:04:18.966 --> 00:04:26.830
"Wait a minute."
"I pop him, he becomes--  Oh man."

00:04:32.926 --> 00:04:38.231
It's amazing.  And Bush.  And Bush is just out there going, "Well, a thousand points of light."

00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:40.752
"They're not burning anymore.  Come on down.  Here we go."

00:04:40.752 --> 00:04:43.782
"You gotta weed and seed."
I figured out how you do George Bush.

00:04:43.782 --> 00:04:49.488
Basically, what you do is, "You take John Wayne."
"And you tighten up his ass."

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.598
"Gonna head the wagon trains on north.  Come on with me."

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.602
CARSON: I never thought of that.  John Wayne.
WILLIAMS: Oh, it's frightening.

00:05:09.602 --> 00:05:11.970
CARSON: You pilgrim it and you bring it up a thousand points.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.476
WILLIAMS: Right on up there.  There you go.  Gonna head the wagon train through, gonna cash some checks.  Here we are.

00:05:17.476 --> 00:05:22.130
It's an amazing thing.  And you look, instead of cowboy boots.  There's topsiders.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.524
It's a wonderful thing.

00:05:23.524 --> 00:05:27.682
It's all the stuff.  Blaming.  He goes off to--  First they blame--

00:05:27.682 --> 00:05:30.674
First they start off blaming the welfare programs of the society.
CARSON: Great society, yeah.

00:05:30.674 --> 00:05:35.774
WILLIAMS: Yeah.  Then they go for Murphy Brown.  Next thing he's going, "Lincoln.  Did it all wrong."

00:05:35.774 --> 00:05:41.560
"Freed people before he had the plan in place.  Won't work"

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.448
"Wrong thing there.  What's going on?"

00:05:44.448 --> 00:05:45.732
CARSON: What do you think of Perot?
WILLIAMS: Perot is amazing.

00:05:45.732 --> 00:05:49.004
CARSON: This is a--  The guys ahead in the polls.  Hasn't said anything.

00:05:49.004 --> 00:05:53.582
WILLIAMS: Hasn't said anything.  Well, you know he's not going to write a bad check.

00:05:53.582 --> 00:06:01.236
"I'll tell you what I-- Hey I own it.  Come on down.  Hey, hey.  How 'bout this.  I'll cover the first 75 days.  Drinks on me.  Come on now."

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:07.480
I have a strange feeling if he gets elected he's going to go in there.
"Thank you all very much.  It's just wonderful that you all did this."

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.585
"It's me!"

00:06:11.624 --> 00:06:15.034
"I'm back!"
CARSON: "I'm back!"
WILLIAMS: "I fooled ya!"

00:06:16.927 --> 00:06:20.250
It looks like he's wearing a halloween mask.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.018
CARSON: A lot of people like Perot.  They think he's Frank Purdue of the Purdue chicken.

00:06:24.018 --> 00:06:31.556
WILLIAMS: "All these chickens.  I raised them myself.  I don't have a foreign policy, but these chickens do."

00:06:31.556 --> 00:06:37.286
CARSON: Oh, God.
WILLIAMS: And Clinton.  Everyone, basically--  Clinton, the whole thing about who he slept with different women.  It doesn't matter if he's--

00:06:37.286 --> 00:06:41.002
I don't care if he slept with a chicken.
If he's got a foreign policy and an economic plan, great.

00:06:41.002 --> 00:06:42.356
This is a whole other thing.

00:06:42.356 --> 00:06:44.996
Imagine if, you know, you do have a president they find out he slept with a sheep.

00:06:44.996 --> 00:06:47.986
"How was he?"
"Not baaaad."

00:06:50.072 --> 00:06:53.880
CARSON: You draw the line there?
WILLIAMS: That's it.  Thank you.  There we go.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:59.610
And you got Jerry Brown.  And Tsongas.  Who is basically--  Tsongas was like, "Hellllo."

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.130
"I have a fiscal budget.  Hahahahaha."

00:07:09.094 --> 00:07:11.866
CARSON: I think Clinton made his big mistake when he said, "I didn't inhale."

00:07:11.866 --> 00:07:14.070
WILLIAMS: Yeah.  That's very--  Now that's a hard one to pull off.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.114
CARSON: And Jerry Brown's problem was he never exhaled.

00:07:24.122 --> 00:07:26.652
You like that?
WILLIAMS: I love that!
CARSON: Thank you.

00:07:26.652 --> 00:07:31.668
WILLIAMS: He's the type of guy--  People look at Jerry Brown and go,
"Oh my God, the man's going to have a bake sale for the Army.

00:07:31.668 --> 00:07:35.054
He's like the Gestalt president.

00:07:35.054 --> 00:07:40.210
And I guess that leaves--
And Buchanan's always over there as the anti-Bush.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.768
"Just waiting.  Don't make a bad move."

00:07:43.768 --> 00:07:45.971
And they've got all those right to life people. I mean that was the whole Murphy Brown issue.

00:07:45.971 --> 00:07:48.604
I mean now there's--  Is he right to life?  Is he for life?  Is he against life?  It doesn't matt--

00:07:48.604 --> 00:07:53.103
It's the whole thing, man.  The right to life people, I'd go with you to see these children.

00:07:53.103 --> 00:07:56.024
They're right to life.  But the moment they're born they go, "I'm out of here."

00:07:56.024 --> 00:07:57.449
CARSON: Yup, as soon as they get that call.

00:07:57.449 --> 00:08:00.368
WILLIAMS: "Bye bye.  See ya."

00:08:01.296 --> 00:08:03.304
CARSON: You're marvelous.  I gotta take a break here.  We're coming back.

00:08:08.124 --> 00:08:10.366
All right, we are back.

00:08:11.486 --> 00:08:12.858
Now.

00:08:15.372 --> 00:08:21.562
What do you do--  Do you still have your ranch?  You call it a ranchette, or a ranch?

00:08:21.562 --> 00:08:23.828
WILLIAMS: Ranchero.
CARSON: A ranchero.

00:08:23.828 --> 00:08:26.156
WILLIAMS: A big ranch up there.

00:08:26.156 --> 00:08:32.859
Not like Ron.  "I don't go up there a lot."  Hanging out there with Nancy going, "Move it, old man!"

00:08:32.859 --> 00:08:34.598
"Let's go!"

00:08:34.598 --> 00:08:38.482
"All right, let's go.  Well, let's get on the horse."

00:08:38.482 --> 00:08:41.270
Even the horse is going, "Again?"

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.688
"The horse is my friend."

00:08:44.688 --> 00:08:47.398
"Meant no harm."

00:08:48.899 --> 00:08:51.564
CARSON: Ah, now, the new baby.
WILLIAMS: Yes, there is a new baby.

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:54.406
CARSON: Yeah.  Six months old.
WILLIAMS: Six months.  It's amazing.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.608
CARSON: Is that two now?
WILLIAMS: Three.

00:08:56.608 --> 00:09:00.704
CARSON: Three?
WILLIAMS: I have three children.  That I know of.

00:09:00.704 --> 00:09:03.654
It's an amazing thing because when they're born, they're so exquisite.

00:09:03.654 --> 00:09:06.441
They're perfectly formed.  This is a little boy.

00:09:06.441 --> 00:09:11.232
Perfectly formed and then these incredibly huge cojones.

00:09:11.232 --> 00:09:15.638
As we say, big cojones.

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:18.456
If that's bleeped, good luck.

00:09:18.456 --> 00:09:20.886
CARSON: Is that a long running family trait?

00:09:20.886 --> 00:09:26.632
WILLIAMS: Your grandfather had a great set, too.

00:09:28.064 --> 00:09:30.424
I hope he grows into these.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.094
I hope they don't just keep getting proportianlly the same.

00:09:33.094 --> 00:09:36.122
Or it's like, "Hi, I'm here."

00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:42.492
CARSON: Well, we're out of here tomorrow night, what do I care?

00:09:47.202 --> 00:09:52.341
What are they gonna do?  Can me?
WILLIAMS: You get those letters.  "Dear Mr. Car--.  Oh, damn."

00:09:52.341 --> 00:09:54.964
"Can you forward this to him?"

00:09:54.964 --> 00:09:58.718
CARSON: I assume, when you came out, for a moment.  I said, "My God."
WILLIAMS: Something's wrong with him.

00:09:58.718 --> 00:10:03.980
CARSON: The blonde hair.  I assume it's for a motion picture role.
Or is it bleached from the sun on the ranch?

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:08.552
WILLIAMS: I did this.  I'm so happy to be here.

00:10:08.552 --> 00:10:13.402
I want to have my own little cable show.  Hi.  Welcome to In Your Ear.

00:10:13.402 --> 00:10:15.434
My guest tonight is Mother Theresa.

00:10:15.434 --> 00:10:18.066
CARSON: Rappin' with Robin.
WILLIAMS: Rappin' with Robin.  We'll be right back.

00:10:18.822 --> 00:10:23.352
Feels like one of those things where you have guests like--
And here are my guests Mother Theresa and Ruta Lee.

00:10:25.056 --> 00:10:30.406
CARSON: And later Mason Reese will be along.
WILLIAMS: Mother Theresa is here pushing her new perfume.  It's called compassion.

00:10:30.406 --> 00:10:32.826
The scent of sentiment.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:39.360
I did this for a movie.  People look at me and go, "Why did you dye your hair, man?"  You know, it's--

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.298
CARSON: Why was it important to be blonde in the picture?

00:10:41.298 --> 00:10:44.156
WILLIAMS: It's just kind of to bother people, I think.

00:10:44.156 --> 00:10:49.170
It's for this-- It's a strange movie.  It's called Toys.  It's about a toy factory.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:55.990
I guess they wanted me to be someone so they would go, "What's wrong?  Something's happened to him."

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.576
CARSON: Is this a comic picture with serious overtones or a serious picture with comic overtones?

00:10:58.576 --> 00:11:01.278
WILLIAMS: Yes.  And we hope for all of those.

00:11:02.134 --> 00:11:04.150
And you have to get it done every three weeks.
It's that whole thing of--

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:09.818
You're sitting in a beauty parlor.
And this whole thing.  You've got tin in your hair-- You get great reception.

00:11:09.818 --> 00:11:14.964
It's very difficult to be sitting under a hair dryer and going, "How about those Bulls, huh?"

00:11:14.964 --> 00:11:18.508
"Hey, great game, yeah?"

00:11:18.508 --> 00:11:19.690
"Want some more coffee?"

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:21.722
"No, I'm fine."

00:11:22.658 --> 00:11:25.040
"I'm doin' real good."

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.252
WILLIAMS: But it's, ahh--
CARSON: I understand Comic Relief raised--  How much money did you raise this year?
WILLIAMS: We raised about six million dollars.
It's an amazing thing.

00:11:29.252 --> 00:11:33.246
CARSON: Oh, that's good.  That's marvelous.

00:11:35.692 --> 00:11:43.027
WILLIAMS: It's incredible.  It's an amazing thing.  You think about all othe money in the world.
It's basically about a tire for one airplane.

00:11:43.027 --> 00:11:47.496
CARSON: Yeah.
WILLIAMS: It's money that goes for medical aid.  Just to keep people going.

00:11:47.496 --> 00:11:51.115
CARSON: You'd think they can go without another B-1 or stealth bomber.

00:11:51.115 --> 00:11:53.998
It costs 900 million dollars or something.

00:11:53.998 --> 00:11:56.738
WILLIAMS: A million, ooh, that's just spare parts.

00:11:56.738 --> 00:11:59.766
It's those things.  "Gotta do it.  Trying to make them happy."

00:11:59.766 --> 00:12:01.230
CARSON: "Points of light."

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.270
"Dan, what do you think about Roe versus Wade?"

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:06.750
"Ahhh, I prefer to float."
"OK."

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.427
Trying to make it happen.

00:12:16.427 --> 00:12:19.745
CARSON: What are you doing when you get any spare time?  When you're not doing concerts

00:12:19.745 --> 00:12:22.666
and Comic Relief and working your material out in clubs and so forth?

00:12:22.666 --> 00:12:28.358
WILLIAMS: Well, I try and-- I run a lot.  I run cross country and stuff.
Cause it's so much cheaper than the old ways.

00:12:31.502 --> 00:12:35.536
When you're out running, nobody goes, "Yo man, need another pair of shoes?"

00:12:35.536 --> 00:12:38.478
It's very difficult to run just because you get that endorphin.

00:12:38.478 --> 00:12:42.628
Which is like your body's way of saying this really hurts.  I'm going to medicate you.

00:12:43.804 --> 00:12:47.253
That's why you see marathon runners who are just like, "How are you doing?" "Huhhh."

00:12:47.938 --> 00:12:53.194
But, I run--
CARSON: Do you get that low heartbeat now that marathon runners get?

00:12:53.194 --> 00:12:54.922
WILLIAMS: Oh, that real low heartbeat.
CARSON: Something down like 36 or 40 beats a minute?

00:12:54.922 --> 00:12:57.430
WILLIAMS: Basically down around a squirrel.  You get that really really really low heartbeat.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:02.576
It's like.  Booop.
Booop.

00:13:02.576 --> 00:13:08.220
Beeep.
Beeep.

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.712
Ehhhh.  Got it.

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:16.901
I'm trying to do a lot of different things.  I mean it's--  And I play with my children a lot.  That's important.

00:13:16.901 --> 00:13:19.394
CARSON: It's great having you here.  I think--
WILLIAMS: This is an amazing night.

00:13:19.394 --> 00:13:23.364
What are you going to do after this?  Why don't you run for pol--
Go, run for office, man.

00:13:25.296 --> 00:13:28.292
Go!  Yes!

00:13:29.508 --> 00:13:32.364
How 'bout it?
You and Gorbachev.

00:13:32.364 --> 00:13:40.306
CARSON: No, no.  They'll go back to when I was in high school and find out what Francine Corbin and I did in the back of a '39 Chrysler and that'll come out to haunt me.  No.

00:13:40.306 --> 00:13:46.152
They look into your background too much.
WILLIAMS: They go beyond that.  It's the type of scrutiny that even Washington would go, thank you.  I'm outta here.

00:13:46.152 --> 00:13:48.846
No one can survive the scrutiny of that.  But, I mean, you can do it.

00:13:48.846 --> 00:13:50.630
You can either run with Gorbachev.  It'd be great.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:53.122
He doesn't have a green card, but what the hell.

00:13:53.122 --> 00:13:55.590
The man's truly an independent.

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:57.652
CARSON: We'll take a break.  We're coming back.
