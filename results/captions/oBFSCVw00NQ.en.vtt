00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:03.820
The 3rd Jewish Temple is prophesied of in
the bible.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:09.200
In the book of Revelation, the apostle John
was told to measure it.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.789
The question is how will it be rebuilt?

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:18.870
There’s so much that is not being told and
you’re going to find out in this video!

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.860
Watch this video to the end and consider all
the evidence.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.920
I guarantee you the 3rd temple will be rebuilt
in God’s perfect timing.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.540
It won’t be built early and it won’t be
built late.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.090
It’s going to come perfectly as God planned
it.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.870
Currently, this is where people believe where
the temple stood.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.460
This square compound is called the temple
mount.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.890
You’ll notice the Dome of the Rock sitting
there.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.880
It’s a Muslim holy site.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.700
And if that’s where the temple used to stand
there’s no way you’ll be able to tear

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:03.380
that mosque down and build a temple over it
without starting World War 3.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:10.720
Every Muslim country will immediately go to
war with Israel if that mosque is torn down.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.630
Now, here’s the genius of God.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.370
That square compound is not the temple mount.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.930
That’s not even where the temple was located.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.560
This is a model of Jerusalem at the Israel
Museum.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.750
During the time of Jesus there was a Roman
fort in the area called Fort Antonia.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:39.750
This dinky compound that’s adjacent to the
temple area it represents Fort Antonia.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.130
In real life, this would be about 3 acres.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.920
It’s supposed to house the 10th Roman legion.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.310
A legion is about 6000 soldiers.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.729
Throw in 4000 support staff and it’s supposed
to house 10,000 people.

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.630
This dinky fort can hold maybe 600 soldiers.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:12.040
Now everyone quotes Josephus as a reliable
historian who lived during that time.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.530
Let me make that clear.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:21.989
He was alive at that time when the temple
was standing and when it was completely destroyed.

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.560
He saw it all.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.330
He lived from 37AD to 100 AD.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.130
The temple was burned in 70AD.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.620
Now Josephus says there was a Roman legion
there.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.750
But scholars say well Josephus must have been
wrong because that little fort can’t hold

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.640
a legion of 6000 soldiers.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.040
Josephus must have meant cohort.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.300
A cohort is 600 soldiers.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.080
Scholars say Josephus is right and reliable
in everything else except the Jewish temple

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.050
and Roman fort.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:08.019
Let me get this straight, Josephus who was
alive and saw it got it wrong and these scholars

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.630
who came over 1000 to 2000 years later think
they know more.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.120
Josephus was there.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.830
If he was so inaccurate don’t you think
he would have been ignored as a historian.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:29.780
Now in 333AD there was an anonymous pilgrim
known as the Pilgrim of Bordeaux who traveled

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.129
to Jerusalem.

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:38.000
He said he looked east from the Church of
the Holy Sepulcher and all he could see was

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.220
the old Roman fort.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.580
Now this is before the Dome of the Rock was
built.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.800
The Dome of the rock was completed in 691AD.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.020
The pilgrim was writing in 333AD.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.240
Now look at where the Church of the Holy Sepulcher
is and look east.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.740
It’s the Dome of the Rock.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.230
It’s what people call the temple mount today.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.620
But the Pilgrim said he saw the old Roman
fort.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.130
Here is the view from the church where the
pilgrim probably looked out from.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.269
Notice how all you see is the Dome of the
Rock.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.509
Now this is the western wall.

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:26.409
It is widely believed that this is the western
wall of the temple and the only piece of the

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:28.599
temple that is standing.

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:35.589
But concerning the destruction of the temple
Eusebius a third century historian said,

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:42.060
“The hill called Zion and Jerusalem, the
building there, that is to say, the temple,

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.409
has been utterly removed or shaken.”

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:47.779
Utterly removed.

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:49.849
That means completely gone.

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:51.080
No wall.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.740
Josephus said, “It was so thoroughly laid
even with the ground by those that dug it

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.849
up to the foundation, that there was left
nothing to make those that came thither believe

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:07.889
it had ever been inhabited.”

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.869
There was left nothing Josephus says.

00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:19.720
Even Jesus said, “Not one stone shall be
left upon another, that shall not be thrown down.”

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:26.180
But modern scholars would say Jesus is wrong
and all those historians are wrong because

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.710
we have the western wall.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.580
The western wall is the only remaining wall
of the temple.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:40.779
No, it was completely destroyed according
to Jesus and these historians.

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:48.909
Eleazar Ben Jair, a commander of Jewish extremists,
who took refuge in Masada, he said, “Jerusalem

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:56.690
is now demolished to the very foundations,
and hath nothing left but that monument of

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:03.969
it preserved, I mean the camp of those Romans
that hath destroyed it, which still dwells

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:05.589
upon its ruins.”

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:12.529
So, this commander said Jerusalem is gone
but the Roman fort is still there.

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:19.869
If that square compound, known as the temple
mount, is actually the old Roman fort where

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:22.020
would the temple be?

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.289
It would be 600 feet south of the fort.

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:33.479
Josephus references about 10 times about the
temple and the fort being separated.

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:40.210
The separation was about 600 feet with the
fort on the higher ground.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:46.319
The traditional model has no separation between
the fort and temple.

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:48.090
They are attached.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.930
They once again assume Josephus is wrong.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:59.880
“Yes, Josephus saw the temple and fort, but he was terrible at describing what we know today.”

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:10.080
Josephus says, “Now as to the Tower of Antonia,
it might seem to be composed of several cities.”

00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:18.810
So, historians think Josephus was exaggerating
because the dinky little fort is so small.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.709
How can that be the size of several cities?

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:30.460
Josephus says, “For if we go up to this
Tower of Antonia, we gain the city since we

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.580
shall then be upon the top of the hill.”

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.939
So, he places the fort on higher ground.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:47.280
The fort was huge, and it was used to keep
order and peace in Jerusalem and that whole area.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:54.460
This new model which separates the fort and
temple lines up with the bible.

00:07:54.469 --> 00:08:02.179
Acts 21:31-32, “Now as they were seeking
to kill him (that’s the Apostle Paul), news

00:08:02.179 --> 00:08:09.409
came to the commander of the garrison that
all Jerusalem was in an uproar.

00:08:09.409 --> 00:08:14.349
He immediately took soldiers and centurions,
and ran down to them.

00:08:14.349 --> 00:08:20.050
And when they saw the commander and the soldiers,
they stopped beating Paul.”

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:28.129
The Bible says they ran down to them because
the fort was on higher ground.

00:08:28.129 --> 00:08:36.740
Acts 21:35, “When he (that’s Paul) reached
the stairs, he had to be carried by the soldiers

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.690
because of the violence of the mob.”

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:47.940
Acts 21:40, “So when he had given him permission,
Paul stood on the stairs and motioned with

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.300
his hand to the people.”

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.660
This is probably the stairs Paul stood at.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.750
Right here.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:09:02.180
Now if we take the traditional model of the
temple what stairs would the bible be talking about?

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:08.900
The Jews dragged Paul out of the temple and
when the Romans came to save him he spoke

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.440
to them from the stairs.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.529
The traditional model has the fort connected
to the temple.

00:09:16.529 --> 00:09:22.880
Also notice how many soldiers the commander
of the fort sends with the apostle Paul.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:32.100
Acts 23:23, “And he called for two centurions,
saying, “Prepare two hundred soldiers, seventy

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:39.579
horsemen, and two hundred spearmen to go to
Caesarea at the third hour of the night.”

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:45.620
He sends 470 soldiers to bring Paul to Caesarea.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:50.360
Scholars say the fort only held 600 soldiers.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:58.339
“My Garrison only has 600 soldiers, but
let’s send 470 of them to go with this nobody

00:09:58.339 --> 00:09:59.370
named Paul.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:03.730
I’ll keep peace in Jerusalem with just 130
soldiers.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:09.360
It’s far more important to send my soldiers
away to guard this nobody.”

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.610
Do you think the Romans are military morons?

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:19.959
There were thousands of Jewish extremists
trying to overthrow the Romans.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:28.060
I guarantee you, that commander had thousands
of troops stationed there to keep peace in Jerusalem.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:35.460
Now if you look at old Roman forts they are
almost the exact size of the temple mount.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:39.410
Here are the remains of an old Roman fort
in Masada.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:43.180
It’s built just like the temple mount area.

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.449
This is how the Romans built their forts.

00:10:46.449 --> 00:10:53.560
Lastly, the temple was very likely located
in the city of David and that was discovered

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.029
just about over 100 years ago.

00:10:57.029 --> 00:11:02.269
By this time the temple mount tradition had
already set in.

00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:09.009
The temple was very likely located by the
Gihon Spring where there is running water.

00:11:09.009 --> 00:11:13.040
There’s no running spring in the temple
mount area.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:20.900
So why do the Jews believe that the square plot
with the Dome of the Rock is the temple area?

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:24.319
All because of tradition.

00:11:24.319 --> 00:11:30.970
Can you imagine telling a Jew, “Hey that
western wall you guys like to pray at is actually

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.720
the wall of an old Roman fort.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.759
Yeah, the people who destroyed your temple
and city, that’s the western wall of the

00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:40.810
fort you’re praying at.”

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:43.389
The Jews will never accept that.

00:11:43.389 --> 00:11:49.980
But one day they will because God has prophesied
the building of the Jewish Temple.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:56.089
When the time is right the Lord will reveal
the location through an archaeological find

00:11:56.089 --> 00:12:00.600
or perhaps an earthquake that reveals something.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.840
Whatever God does, He has it all planned out.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:10.980
And he has hidden the true temple site until
the time comes to rebuild it.
