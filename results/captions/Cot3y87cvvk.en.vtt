00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.390
Hello friends.

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:05.340
This is Max Egorov and you are watching the
second part of the series of short videos

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.929
on my successful attempt to colonize a totally
wild and secluded place.

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.929
You are looking at the Russian forest, where
such hot weather is not common.

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.410
In the summer it is fairly warm and never
gets dark.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.750
You might have heard about white nights in
St.Petersburg.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.650
We are approximately 300 km north of it.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.790
the rest of the year the weather here is very
harsh thus building a reliable shelter is

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.000
a must.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.190
I decided to build my log cabin without chopping
down a single live tree.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.969
A lot of the tall trees here were downed by
a severe storm a few years ago.

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:45.059
So, I decided to reclaim those extra-thick
logs for my cabin's construction.

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.449
I chose a round notch (also knows as a saddle
cope) to join logs in my cabin.

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.379
I used a piece of charcoal to layout the log
joint

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.149
because it could draw well on the wet log.

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.530
Most of the material was removed with a chainsaw
and a small prybar and then I finished shaping

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.170
the notch with a hand adze.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.820
I used my Finnish axe and adze to make the
longitudinal groves.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.820
I have to confess, towards the end of the
cabin's construction I used my chainsaw more

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.820
and more for rough shaping of both notches
and groves to speed up the process.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.920
According to the construction code in Russia,
the longitudinal groove should be half the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.420
width of the top log's diameter.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.490
That will make your log cabin more energy
efficient.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.469
The downside, to strictly following this code,
is it will take more logs and more work to

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:27.660
build the same size cabin.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.660
If you are planning to live in a log cabin
during the winter it is advisable to make

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.660
the longitudinal groove wider than I did in
order to sink the top log deeper into the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.660
bottom log.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.020
While fitting the logs I had to move a heavy
log back and forth.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.920
It was easy to do using a pry bar and a strap's
loop.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.510
My seemingly unwise decision to carry a heavy
pry bar strapped to my backpack while getting

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.200
to my camp site on foot paid off.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.009
It became an important tool in my cabin's
construction.

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:58.609
Another tool that I was glad I brought with
me was my homemade draw shave.

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:04.439
I was able to easily debark and smoothen the
wet logs using the draw shave.

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.440
I also used it to do the finishing touches
on the log butts, which made the cabin look

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:19.860
more refined.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:27.540
To make my cabin stronger I used square wooden
stakes to secure each log's layer.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.620
It is a bit ironic but this is what old carpenters
used to do.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.610
They hammered square wooden stakes into predrilled
round holes.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.610
Go figure...

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.810
I think it is done so because it's easier
to make a square wooden stake

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.680
than a dowel and such fastener would less
likely split the log.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.020
Anyhow, I couldn't come up with a better explanation
on that strange classical practice.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.560
If you know other reasons why the wooden stakes
are made square please let me know.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.220
Lastly, it is important to trim the wooden
stake a little below the level of the log

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.500
so it wouldn't stick out when the logs dry
out and shrink in diameter.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.500
I filled the grooves with moss for better
insulation.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.500
This is my first experience in laying logs
and things were not going very smoothly in

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.500
the beginning; however,
it turned out to be an enjoyable and comparatively

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.500
simple experience.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.080
I want to show you two panoramic sceneries
of the same place.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:13.099
As you can see this small piece of land looks
quite different from now.

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.370
However, right outside of my camp the forest
is littered with tall fallen trees that are

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.970
just rotting...

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.840
If I didn't run other projects at the same
time,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.040
such as making kayaks from branches with tarp
or clear plastic skin, making a dome from

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.000
branches and plastic wrap, making canopies,
hammocks, primitive sawmill

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.379
as well as fishing and mushrooming,
I probably would have finished my log cabin

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.240
by the end of my one month vacation.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.200
In reality I will have to come back here next
year to finish building my cabin.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.200
I will show it in the next part.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.390
If you liked the video, perhaps, you could
share it with your friends.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.110
Let good people watch good videos!

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.949
This is Max Egorov
