00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:10.019
It is the most fundamental experience of all defining our waking moments and giving rise to all that we think and feel

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.720
Without consciousness

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.209
we have no way of proving we or anything else exists and

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.630
Yet what it is and why we have it remain a mystery that some of the greatest minds have been unable to solve

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:34.199
The only way I know I exist is because I'm conscious I wake up in the dark of a hotel room I'm

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.929
Discombobulated because I'm jet-lagged. I've no idea where I am Who I am and what country I am yet

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.930
I know I exist because I see something

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:49.559
Rapid advances in our understanding of how the brain works might one day allow us to pinpoint the parts of the brain that generate consciousness

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.409
But will something as objective as science be able to explain what it feels like to be us

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.089
Consciousness - nature is private. It's subjective

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.660
I know about my consciousness from the first-person point of view other people don't know about my consciousness very indirectly

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.149
Philosophers have been trying to answer some of these questions for millennia in the past couple of centuries scientists have joined them

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.860
Debate can be fierce

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:25.529
In fact some scholars reckon, the puzzle of consciousness is something that human mind is incapable of solving. I think that's

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.680
Not just wrong. I think it's it's

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.460
Culpably wrong it isn't impossible at all. It's just that we have to buckle down and do it

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.569
One thing that both disciplines can agree on is that consciousness arises in the brain

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:54.319
Made up of roughly 85 billion neurons and other supporting cells about which we know little the brain consumes almost 20 percent of our energy

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.289
Despite comprising just 2% of our mass

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.399
Every so often I get kind of interested in astronomy and cosmology because you look out there and you think oh gosh

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.499
This is amazing. You know, it's almost limitless

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.170
but then I turn around and kind of

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.069
Introspective and think about the brain and it's kind of like a universe within

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.690
We're a long ways of understanding how it works. But if we can get down to figuring out how a neuron works

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.160
By God, then we could deal with it two neurons and then four neurons and four million neurons and then a hundred million

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.760
Helped by developments in imaging partly pioneered by dr

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.750
Reichal and his team scientists can study in some detail the two enormous folded sheets of out of rain called the cerebral cortex

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.839
This plays a crucial role in higher brain functions like memory perception thought and language

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.899
and I have two of them in my left hand height and

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.860
And it's part of this sheet that gives eyes to consciousness this sheet

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.489
Also give rise to intelligence and reasoning and all the other things that we hold dear

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.589
But the what the human brain in the human mind Christophe Kok wants to come up with a satisfactory

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.140
scientific theory of consciousness before he dies

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.160
Science wants to explain everything if if science fails to explain the central fact of my existence. I

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.639
Would say then it's a it's it's a failure

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.690
In order to gain a better understanding of how parts of the brain work scientists often. Look at bits of it that are broken

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.070
It's a little part of the brain called the cerebellum, which is at the back of my brain

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.320
If I lose it

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:34.999
I will be unable to let's say to dance or beer or climb and her difficulty moving my speech becomes slurred but

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.370
My consciousness will not be impaired

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.739
On the flip side. It seems that some parts of the brain may be essential for consciousness

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.070
Identifying these so called neural correlates of consciousness would help pin down what is happening?

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.789
What might the NCC the neural correlates of consciousness be like

00:03:53.489 --> 00:04:00.019
Assuming that it is that it's an emergent and neuro scientific and let me say straight away that we don't know was his life

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.850
Before his death in 2004 Francis Crick the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.510
Worked with dr. Cock on something. They termed the binding problem

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:16.850
Put simply the binding problem asks how the brain integrates different bits of information it gets both sensory and internal

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.950
into our conscious experience

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:26.480
in real life the brain is terribly good and puts everything together the movement the shape and

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.560
and the color

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.989
The usual way of saying the binding problem is if you have a red square and a green triangle

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:41.510
How is it that you don't have see it as that get the colors mixed up with the shapes. That's basically the problem

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.320
Because our experience of consciousness is derived from the data we get from lots of different systems the visual and motor being just two

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.069
The two men looked at a part of the brain that is connected to all these regions

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.519
They were especially interested in the claustrum a thin sheet of nerve cells that sits at the bottom of the cerebral cortex

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.710
in each hemisphere of the brain

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.049
Because testing the claustrum in a live human brain is invasive and risky. No formal experiments have been done

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:14.029
But one happened accidentally last year when a neurologist trying to understand the source of his patient's epilepsy implanted electrodes near her claustro

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.850
When he switched the current on she lost consciousness as soon as he switched it off. She regained it

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.380
No one knows why we have consciousness

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.070
It's one of the big mysteries

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.790
Why did evolution bother putting consciousness in how did evolution put consciousness in?

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:39.739
Why couldn't we have done everything that we do with a set of objective mechanisms and no first-person subjective experience of the world

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.859
It's one of the biggest questions and philosophy in science just as the processes of consciousness remain a mystery

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.799
So does its purpose is it a high-level summary?

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.620
the brain generates to help us plan for what comes next a

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.869
Clever way of designing our brains to make us more adept at being social neither both

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:05.770
One evolutionary explanation for why we have consciousness suggested an animal capable of modeling the behavior of another can anticipate it to its advantage

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:10.599
The surprising thing is that so few animals actually have this ability

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:12.800
Humans have it

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.789
so I have a very good idea of what you're going to do and when you're going to do it and why you're going to

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:19.999
do it and

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:25.209
Children starting it maybe around three years old get that Janet Metcalf

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:33.039
the theory of mind a theory of mind is actually misnomer the way we tested is whether a person

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:35.210
or an animal

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:42.729
Can give evidence that they can get into the other person's shoes or the other person's mind and see the world from that

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:45.039
person's perspective

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.800
now the

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.719
the test of it is often not just can you see from the viewpoint of the other person but could you see that someone has

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:54.819
a different viewpoint from your own

00:06:55.999 --> 00:07:01.479
the theory of mind might provide one way of working out if animals other than humans are conscious the

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:06.609
Only species that we're absolutely sure has theory of mind is human

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:08.870
and

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.399
maybe

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:12.399
humans older than

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:15.129
roughly three years old

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:23.169
It's very controversial whether any other animals have it. They're arguing about whether chimps have theory of mind or not

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.389
Before we can have a theory of mind

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:33.278
We must recognize ourselves for decades scientists have used something called the Rouge test to see whether animals do just that

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:36.248
Human babies do from about eighteen months old

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:41.289
Chimpanzees presented with mirrors soon use them to groom themselves much as we do

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:46.958
Elephants dolphins and Magpies also can respond to mirrors in ways that suggest self recognition

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:53.409
The problem with the roush test that the animal researchers

00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:58.269
Always raise is that maybe there? It's just body knowledge

00:07:58.939 --> 00:08:01.269
That it's not mind knowledge

00:08:01.939 --> 00:08:07.659
so it was interpreted as the animal knowing that they have a mind and

00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:13.869
Theory of mind as we normally think that is related to another person not to the self

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:21.970
But presumably you have to know that you have a mind before you project that same capability onto someone else

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.190
Identifying the neural correlates of self recognition in animals would be a hard task

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.299
But if we were able to do it comparative studies would be possible

00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:33.969
That would be hugely valuable

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:41.919
Science is edging closer to understanding what parts of the brain might be involved in generating conscious experience

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:48.339
By some estimates we may not be far away from an empirically sound theory of consciousness and how it evolved

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:55.089
But could a physical theory ever satisfactorily address what it is that people are feeling when they are conscious

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:03.609
David Chalmers calls consciousness the hard problem a deft description for something that is hard to explain and hard to solve

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:10.599
The methods of science right now are great for explaining objective processes and objective functions

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.979
So when it comes even to explaining things like the behavior of an organism

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:20.589
You can tell some story about a bit of the brain a neural process or a computer leg process in the brain

00:09:20.589 --> 00:09:27.429
That makes us behave a certain way, but the problem of consciousness what we call the hard problem of consciousness, which is explaining

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:31.539
How you get subjective experience from the brain is not that kind of question

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.169
It's not a question about how we behave it's a question about

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:42.940
You know what? It's like about how it feels from the inside and looks like you can explain all those

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:51.250
Objective mechanisms and objective processes and you still won't have answered the hard problem which is why is it that all that functioning is?

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:53.410
accompanied by consciousness

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.629
The hard problem divides philosophers and scientists alike

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:03.729
some philosophers argue that consciousness can be explained far more simply a

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.030
lot of puzzles Bell mysteries

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.890
We're going to understand it from the bottom up and from the top down. I

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.010
Have no doubt about that

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:21.609
Daniel Dennett argues that consciousness is nothing more than a cognitive illusion that science will into course explain

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:28.000
Our brains have been designed by evolution and then redesigned by cultural evolution

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.670
to give us a

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.800
user-friendly

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.609
System of things in the world that we deal with so

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.480
the

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.270
user-friendly world that we live in the manifest image is a sort of

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:48.070
friendly user illusion in the same way that the

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:55.119
Desktop of your laptop is a user illusion it simplifies and it distorts in

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:59.650
Helpful ways for most purposes if you really want to know what's going on

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:03.160
You have to go backstage and the same thing is true about the bay

00:11:05.639 --> 00:11:09.439
Until recently we didn't have very good tools for doing it the brain was just

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.289
off limits as off-limits as

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:15.139
distant galaxies

00:11:15.149 --> 00:11:22.068
we're now developing the tools for non-invasively studying the brain and we're now developing the

00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:25.379
Computational ideas

00:11:25.379 --> 00:11:33.109
and models so that we can understand how a brain can non miraculously deal with information and

00:11:34.019 --> 00:11:35.610
refine it and

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:37.019
uncover the

00:11:37.019 --> 00:11:40.099
semantics of the world or outside and inside

00:11:40.889 --> 00:11:47.448
So we're now we now have the toolkit and it's taken this long to develop it now. We just have to use the tools

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:56.300
Perhaps but for the time being the puzzle of consciousness continues to pose more questions than it does answers

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.449
Yet another philosopher Pythagoras of Abdera proclaimed that man is the measure of all things

00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:10.188
Until the problem of consciousness is solved though. That might better be phrased the measure of all things but himself
