00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.500
- Hi it's me, Tim Dodd,
the Everyday Astronaut.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.500
SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, the
world's first reusable rocket.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:08.700
(record scratching)
Wait!

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.533
No it's not.

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:10.930
Do you remember the Space Shuttle?

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.810
It had those Solid Rocket
Boosters, and the Orbiter,

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.150
which were both reusable weren't they?

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.930
Well today we're going to talk about

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.630
why the Space Shuttle failed
to actually be reusable

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.050
and wound up being described

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.880
with a more accurate word, refurbishable.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.730
People often cite the
shortcomings of the Space Shuttle

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.760
and are quick to point it

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.070
to SpaceX's claims of the
Falcon 9 booster being reusable.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.390
So today we're going to
look at what it takes

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.100
to get the Space Shuttle
operational between flights,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.060
what it takes to get a Falcon
9 operational between flights,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.150
and why SpaceX's first stage booster

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.890
take much less of a beating
than the Space Shuttle did.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.540
We'll also do a quick reminder

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.770
of what technologies SpaceX
added to their Block 5 booster

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.760
to hopefully achieve their goal

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.000
of making a rapidly reusable rocket

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.910
that can truly be reused 10 times

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.210
before needing any kind
of serious refurbishment.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.140
Let's get started!

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.499
- [Technician] Three, two, one, zero,

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:04.944
and lift off.

00:01:04.944 --> 00:01:07.069
- [Neil] That's one small step for man.

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:10.486
(upbeat, rhythmic music)

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.240
- Reusable is definitely
the hottest buzz word

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.740
in the new space industry.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.870
If you don't know why a
vehicle being reusable

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.970
is such a massive game changer,

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.970
may I suggest checking out my video

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.460
Why does Falcon Heavy matter

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.010
to help get a good perspective
on why reusability matters.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.350
But long story short,

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.610
the margins to get stuff
to space are so thin

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.620
it takes a massive rocket

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.980
to put anything substantial up there.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.410
So unfortunately there's just
too little margins left over

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.490
to add additional hardware
to make a rocket reusable.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.730
This makes spaceflight
extremely, extremely expensive.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.610
As in, so expensive we're
hoping to someday see

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.063
costs come down to just
a $1000 per kilogram!

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.380
Yeah, imagine those shipping
costs down here on Earth.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.010
Hi there, I'm calling to get a quote

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.930
for some new tires for
my 2011 Hyundai Elantra.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.070
Yes of course it's the GT model.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.610
I did some really cool drifting

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.510
and so that's why the tires are bad.

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.730
How much would the new tires be?

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.360
Oh $400?

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.467
How much for shipping?

00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:18.110
$36000!

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.220
And that would actually be a steal

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.160
compared to the historically
astronomical prices

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.509
of getting space hardware into space.

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:28.100
Even the cheapest dollar to kilogram ratio

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.230
is around the $3000 per kilogram mark,

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.690
thanks to the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.390
It's a good thing rocket
delivery isn't the standard

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.223
here on Earth.

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:39.810
So here's where reusability comes in.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.890
It's honestly fundamental.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:42.890
Of course!

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.330
Why throw away super expensive
multi-million dollar engines

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.760
and a massive fuselage
and all that extra stuff

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.290
when you could just reuse it, right?

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.270
I mean duh!

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.430
Well that was the original
idea for the Space Shuttle.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.310
Believe it or not,

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.070
NASA was seeking a reusable launch vehicle

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.570
before we even put humans on the moon.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.660
The original studies began in 1968,

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.030
some 10 months before Neil Armstrong

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.230
famously took the first steps on the moon.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.330
As a matter of fact,

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.480
one of the first people to fly
the Space Shuttle, John Young

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.410
was walking on the moon when
he got news of the shuttle.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.700
- [Tony] This looks like a good time

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.680
for some good news here.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.370
The House passed the space
budget yesterday, 277 to 60,

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.096
which includes the votes for the shuttle.

00:03:27.096 --> 00:03:28.071
(beeping)

00:03:28.071 --> 00:03:31.463
- [Charlie] That's wonderful, wonderful.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.630
Tony, again I'll say it.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.810
With that salute I'm
proud to be an American.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.590
I'll tell you, what a
program and what a place

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.423
and what an experience.

00:03:40.423 --> 00:03:42.245
- [John] Yeah, and I'll
say it too. (beeping)

00:03:42.245 --> 00:03:43.078
- [Tony] So am I.

00:03:43.078 --> 00:03:44.920
Country needs that shuttle mighty bad.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.670
- So with all the excitement
leading up to the shuttle,

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.762
fast forward 50 years to today

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:53.280
and the Space Shuttle has kind
of a bad taste in our mouths.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.070
It wound up being terribly
expensive, pretty dangerous,

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.660
and actually more expensive

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.950
than just about any other
way to get into space,

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.260
although it could do things

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.260
that no other launch vehicle could do.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.240
So with some of the greatest
minds working on the shuttle,

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.340
why did it fail its promise
of bringing the cost down?

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.770
Is SpaceX doomed to repeat history

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.280
or has a lot changed in 50 years?

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.240
So first, let's look at the
recovery methods of each system.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.150
They're quite different.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.460
The Space Shuttle utilized

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.550
both parachutes and a lifting
body to recover hardware.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.290
Let's go in order of what was recovered,

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.760
so starting with the Solid Rocket Boosters

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.350
which were jettisoned around
two minutes into flight.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.390
The boosters separate

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.640
while traveling around
4800 kilometers an hour

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.240
or 3000 miles an hour,

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.920
at an altitude of around
45 kilometers or 30 miles.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.130
And due to their velocity,

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.620
they continue to coast
upward to their highest point

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.610
of around 65 kilometers or 40 miles.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.550
Just a fun note,

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.260
that does means the SRBs
never actually make it

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.330
above the Karman line

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.750
or the commonly agreed
upon boundary of space.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.480
So keep that in mind.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.520
The boosters fall back
through the atmosphere

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.610
and start popping a sequence of parachutes

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.610
at exactly 4786 meters or 15704 feet.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.460
Eventually after a pilot
chute, and a drogue chute,

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.330
the three main parachutes deploy

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.080
and splish splash the booster

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.190
down relatively softly in the ocean.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.210
The Orbiter on the other hand
is traveling much, much faster

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.097
and its recovery, like all
orbital things, is a lot hotter.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.950
About one hour before touchdown,
the Orbiter turns around

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.410
and faces away from its
direction of travel or prograde.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.580
It fires up its orbital
maneuvering system or OMS

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.460
and slows down 1%.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.720
Yep, that's it, only about 1%!

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.340
And that's enough to lower its orbit

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.620
from about 480 kilometers or 300 miles

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.620
down to just 45 kilometers or
28 miles at its lowest point.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.770
That's crazy.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.520
The Orbiter then turns back around

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.500
so it can reenter at
about a 40 degree angle.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.110
Now it's time for the
atmosphere to do its work.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.220
The Orbiter is absolutely
cruising at this point.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.390
It's still traveling around
27000 kilometers an hour

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.580
or 17000 miles an hour,

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.640
the Orbiter begins to hit air molecules

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.880
and starts to build up a ton of friction

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.980
and therefore a ton of heat.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.240
The Orbiter will reach temperatures

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.240
of 1650 degrees Celsius or
3000 degrees Fahrenheit!

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.993
Ouch!

00:06:28.993 --> 00:06:30.560
But luckily, the Orbiter is covered

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.960
with four different types
of thermal protection.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.520
It has reinforced carbon-carbon
on the leading edges,

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.520
then there were between
24177 and 31088 tiles,

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.820
depending on the Orbiter,

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.960
on the underside and front of the vehicle,

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.760
then there is white Nomex blankets

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.927
on the upper payload bay doors,
the upper wing and fuselage,

00:06:50.927 --> 00:06:52.820
and a few white surface tiles

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.510
for low temperature areas as well.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.880
For 12 minutes, the shuttle
had so much hot ionized gases

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.510
surrounding the vehicle, it
caused a full radio blackout.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.500
Eventually, after several
minutes of atmospheric drag

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.690
and some computer guided S-turns,

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.440
the shuttle bleeds off
a lot of its velocity.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.520
Once it's about 40 kilometers
or 25 miles downrange,

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.470
the commander drops the
nose to minus 20 degrees,

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.130
that's almost seven times steeper

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:19.560
than a commercial airliner,

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.670
and it's still traveling 20 times faster.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.030
Finally the shuttle lands
like a traditional jetliner,

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.300
only a little quicker,

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.630
touching down at 350 kilometers
an hour or 220 miles an hour

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.660
on a 4.5 kilometer or
2.8 mile long runway.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.230
That runway's actually so long

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.240
that there's over a one and a half meter

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.820
or over 5 feet in
relative height difference

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.160
between the ends of the runway

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.070
due to the curve of the Earth!

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:46.870
That's crazy.
(whistles)

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:47.840
It's quite the journey!

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.200
Welcome home, Space Shuttle.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.680
So now, let's do a quick rundown

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.640
on how a Falcon 9 is recovered.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.400
I've covered this topic a
few times, more in depth,

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.080
so if you have any questions remaining,

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.420
check out my video How
SpaceX lands the Falcon 9.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.510
At around two minutes and
40 seconds into flight,

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.690
the Falcon 9 shuts down its main engines,

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.070
called MECO or main engine cut off.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.320
It coasts for a moment

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.840
and then the first stage
lets go of the second stage

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.110
for stage separation.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.710
At this point the Falcon 9 is traveling

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.440
up to 8000 kilometers an hour
or almost 5000 miles an hour

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.520
at an altitude of 65
kilometers or 40 miles.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.980
Quick note, that's about twice as fast

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.610
as the Space Shuttle's rocket boosters.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.760
The first stage quickly
performs a flip maneuver

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.010
with its nitrogen thrusters,
to point its engines prograde.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.461
Then, depending on the mission,

00:08:31.461 --> 00:08:34.340
the booster may ignite
three of its nine engines

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.780
and do a boost back burn if
it's going to land back at land.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.500
But there might not be
enough margins left over

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.910
to do the boost back burn.

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:44.130
In that case it's omitted and the Falcon 9

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.480
continues on its ballistic trajectory

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.290
away from the launch pad and
heads towards the drone ship

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.650
that's been precisely placed
based on each mission profile.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:53.750
But in either case,

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.120
the booster will coast
up to its highest point,

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.520
typically over the Karman line

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.680
or 100 kilometers or 62 miles.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.570
In other words,

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.610
the booster gets to hang out
in space for a minute or so!

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.100
Lucky, I wanna go.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.953
Around 55 kilometers or
34 miles in altitude,

00:09:08.953 --> 00:09:12.130
the Falcon 9 will light up
three of its nine Merlin engines

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:14.080
as it reenters the atmosphere.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.890
It does this to slow itself down

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:19.690
and it actually creates a
literal force field around itself

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:21.430
so it can survive reentry.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:23.830
After around 20 seconds of reentry burn,

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.940
the booster scrubs off 30
to 40% of its velocity,

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.110
which is enough to
withstand the remaining heat

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.100
as the atmosphere gets
thicker and thicker.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.580
The atmosphere will then take off

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.700
another 60 to 70% of
the remaining velocity

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.180
until the booster is only traveling

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:41.270
about 1000 kilometers an
hour or 620 miles an hour.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.100
Then it lights up one or
three of its Merlin engines

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.860
to perform the final landing burn

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.890
which it needs to time perfectly.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.570
Even with just one of
the nine engines running

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.300
at its minimum throttle,

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.250
the booster still has
too much thrust to hover.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:58.100
So if the vehicle stops
before it hits the ground,

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.873
it'll actually start going back up.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.520
Yeah, that's not good.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.300
This needs to be perfectly timed

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.330
in a maneuver called the
hover-slam or suicide burn.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.090
Then the landing legs deploy

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:14.280
and the Falcon 9 softly touches down.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.611
Well, hopefully.

00:10:15.611 --> 00:10:18.611
(explosive booming)

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.810
So before we move on, let's
really quick remind you

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.870
why the Falcon 9 doesn't use parachutes

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:28.430
like the Space Shuttle SRBs did.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:29.910
Well there's a few reasons,

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.360
and I'm just gonna breeze through these,

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.650
since I've done many videos about this

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.230
and I probably still need to do

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.660
a more dedicated and
updated video about it.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.620
So here's Everyday
Astronaut's top seven reasons

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.880
why SpaceX doesn't use
parachutes to land the Falcon 9!

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.710
One: SpaceX tried to use parachutes

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.550
on the first two Falcon 9
missions to recover the booster.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:49.383
Unfortunately,

00:10:49.383 --> 00:10:51.760
the booster is going about
twice as fast as the SRBs

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.160
and the parachutes couldn't
survive the extra forces.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.510
Two: The rocket already has
engines capable of slowing down,

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.820
why not use them?

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.920
Does a helicopter need
a parachute to land?

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.290
No it has an engine and
a propeller already!

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:04.870
Three: You can't land a large rocket

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.610
on Mars or the moon with a parachute,

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:09.000
the atmosphere is too thin or nonexistent.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.620
So you'd better start practicing
propulsive landings now

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:12.453
and get good at 'em!

00:11:12.453 --> 00:11:14.010
Four: The rocket needs to slow down

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.320
before it hits the atmosphere
to survive reentry anyway.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.420
Remember that whole reentry burn thing?

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.310
Yeah, a parachute can't work very well

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:21.690
before it's in the atmosphere,

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:23.880
so rocket engines are the only way to go.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.730
Five: Parachutes and the supporting system

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:26.870
that would allow the fuselage

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.530
to get stretched and not just compressed

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.540
would just add otherwise dead weight.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.717
Six: Parachutes, although steerable,

00:11:32.717 --> 00:11:34.920
are not nearly as precise as grid fins,

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.889
cold gas thrusters and an engine gimbal.

00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:38.900
SpaceX is finding this out the hard way

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.220
as they tried to catch their fairings

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.580
under steerable parafoils.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.150
Seven: Splashing down is bad mkay.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.310
Salt water and precise
liquid rocket engine

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:47.260
don't mix very well.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.620
So that's actually a
great place to transition.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.730
Okay, so now that we recovered

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.590
the reusable parts of the Space Shuttle

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.650
and the first stage of the Falcon 9,

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.480
what did they do to
prepare them for reflight?

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.927
Let's start with the Space Shuttle.

00:12:00.927 --> 00:12:03.570
What did it take to get
one back to the launch pad?

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.060
After splashdown, the
boosters were sealed up

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.445
by scuba divers with a giant plug

00:12:08.445 --> 00:12:09.910
where they drained the water

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.100
so it could be towed back
to Kennedy Space Center.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.740
Each booster required a crew
of 18 for ocean recovery.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.700
The Space Shuttle
obviously had two boosters,

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.220
so that's 36 people on booster recovery.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.200
Then the boosters are disassembled

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.090
and sent out to Promontory, Utah

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:27.220
to be cleaned, paint stripped, repainted,

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.700
inspected and reloaded
with solid propellant.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.630
Then they go back to Kennedy Space Center

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.420
for assembly at the United
Space Alliance Assembly

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.320
and Refurbishment Facility.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.690
I like the name of that place.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.600
The four segments in each booster

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.217
are then mated to a new igniter,

00:12:41.217 --> 00:12:44.330
forward segment, nose cap, aft skirt

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.520
and frustum, whatever that is.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.750
So basically just the casing
was actually truly reused.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:54.020
I definitely think refurbished
is the right word here

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.190
considering they stripped it down

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:56.970
to the bare metal each time

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:01.070
and taken to a place called
the Refurbishment Facility.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:05.210
Okay, so the boosters aren't
at all what I'd call reusable,

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:06.950
but how about the Orbiter?

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.600
What's it take to actually
get that thing reflying?

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.640
After touching down,

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.000
a highly trained crew of 150 people

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.160
and 25 specially designed vehicles

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.030
head out to intercept the vehicle.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.470
They do safety checks for
explosives and toxic gases,

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:21.890
helped the crew exit the Orbiter

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.000
and eventually they tow it

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.940
to the Orbiter Processing Facility.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.280
Once inside the 2700 square meter

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.480
or 29000 square foot hangar,

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.510
the shuttle would be processed
for approximately 125 days.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.270
More than 115 multi-level platforms

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:37.490
would surround the vehicle

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:39.890
so engineers could
check six million parts.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:43.310
Six million parts!

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:44.143
What?

00:13:44.143 --> 00:13:46.730
But first technicians
would don hazmat suits

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:47.670
to clean the vehicle

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.450
of any remaining toxic
and hypergolic elements.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.210
Then they would remove the
Orbital Maneuvering System pods

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.560
and the Forward Reaction
Control Systems modules

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.320
to be repaired and retested.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.760
Then crews would take off

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:03.000
all three of the Space Shuttle's
main engines, or RS-25's.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.110
These babies are still incredible engines,

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:09.310
some of the most efficient
engines ever made.

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.740
But they required a healthy
amount of inspection

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.000
and refurbishment between each flight.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.730
Each engine had 50000 parts

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.370
and about 7000 of which were life-limited

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.100
and occasionally had to be replaced.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.730
In 2002, Kennedy Space Center

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.230
took over assembly tasks of the engines

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.380
instead of sending them
out for refurbishment.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.730
But perhaps the biggest

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.440
and most daunting task
of the Space Shuttle

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.650
was inspecting the thousands and thousands

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.800
of fragile silica tiles on
the bottom of the Orbiter.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.800
There were between 24177 and 31088 tiles,

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:45.700
depending on the Orbiter.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.820
Every single one was unique

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.600
and had to be carefully inspected
and if damaged, replaced.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.940
And of course, all the
avionics, the payload bay,

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.590
the hydraulic control
surfaces et cetera, et cetera,

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.380
were carefully checked out
between each flight as well.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.510
In total, the Space Shuttle required

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:07.510
no less than 650000 hours of
labor between each flight.

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:11.280
Say the average person made $25 an hour,

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.330
which I'm sure is kind of conservative

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.110
for a highly trained technician,

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:16.180
the cost of human labor

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.350
to get a Space Shuttle ready for launch

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.450
would be around 16 million dollars!

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:24.600
And again, that's being
fairly conservative.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.180
But it wasn't always this way.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.360
Actually, before the
Challenger accident in 1986,

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.500
the shuttle went through much
less refurbishment and checks.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.040
So few in fact, it may have seen as little

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:39.210
as almost 1% the amount of
labor hours between flights.

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:40.451
But after the Challenger accident,

00:15:40.451 --> 00:15:42.860
NASA changed the entire process

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.560
of getting the Space Shuttle flight ready

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.420
and wound up going over every single inch

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.670
with a fine tooth comb.

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.020
That's probably a good thing

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.260
when you're dealing with human life.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.200
Oh and lastly, after 1989,
to get the shuttle ready

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.000
it was placed on top of the
Orbiter Transfer System,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.590
a 76 wheel transporter,
to take it from the OPF

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:02.950
to the Vehicle Assembly building

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:04.320
to be mated with the external tank

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.650
and the Solid Rocket Boosters.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.930
Fun fact, SpaceX now owns
the Orbiter Transfer System

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:10.520
to transport their boosters!

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.530
Okay, now time for the big question.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:16.090
What does it take to
get a Falcon 9 booster

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:17.280
back to the launch pad?

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.250
Let me start off by saying
a lot of this is speculation

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.010
since SpaceX doesn't make public

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.370
exactly what goes into preparation,

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.100
but let's give a rundown
on what they have done,

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.810
and what things they will be doing.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.370
So first off, if it
landed on the drone ship,

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.020
a little robot actually comes out

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.220
and grabs onto the
booster and hangs on to it

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.853
so this doesn't happen.

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.770
It's then transported back

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:49.470
by a support crew of
around 10 and two ships.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:50.960
But if the booster lands on land,

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.840
the booster is picked up by a crane

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.250
and put onto their transporter.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.960
For the first few years
of the Falcon 9 reuse,

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.060
the booster were shipped back to Hawthorne

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.360
for the refurbishment.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.700
But SpaceX is building a
booster refurbishment facility

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:04.533
at the cape.

00:17:04.533 --> 00:17:05.936
The first booster to ever land

00:17:05.936 --> 00:17:09.910
on December 21, 2015 for the OG2 mission,

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.860
was extensively torn down and inspected.

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.240
Since this was the first booster

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.440
that SpaceX actually caught in one piece

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.700
they had to check their work

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.980
and see if it actually came out okay.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:25.340
On the first 13 reused boosters,
or non-Block 5 boosters,

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:28.650
we know SpaceX changed out
the heat shields and blankets

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:29.803
behind the exhaust nozzles.

00:17:29.803 --> 00:17:32.750
We know they had to fix
and repair the grid fins

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.690
on the extra hot missions.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:37.570
We know they had to do a lot
of inspections on the vehicle

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:39.930
but they also had to run
an X-ray along the booster

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:42.490
to ensure the fuselage
is still good to go.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:43.700
Now I've heard speculations

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:47.810
of between 1000 to 10000
human hours of labor

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:50.700
for the turnaround of the
Block 3 and Block 4 boosters.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.150
And say this is terribly conservative.

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:56.250
Say it's actually 100000 hours of labor,

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.930
that'd still be over six times less labor

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:01.480
than the Space Shuttle Orbiter.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.950
The Falcon 9 has much
less systems to check over

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.890
than the Orbiter, so I think
it's pretty safe to assume

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.050
there's a lot less labor hours required

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:10.270
to prepare it for reflight.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:13.720
We know SpaceX has a goal with
their new Block 5 Falcon 9

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.660
to see it land and refly
within 24 to 48 hours

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:21.340
with nothing but inspections
and checks between flights.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.679
The overall goal of
their new block 5 booster

00:18:23.679 --> 00:18:26.200
is to be reflown 10 times

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.930
without any actual
refurbishment, only inspections.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.140
They built Block 5 having
learned the lessons

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.330
from the 24 recoveries
leading up to Block 5.

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.200
If you need a reminder of
what's new with Block 5,

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.640
I have a video all about

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.500
what Block 5 is and what has changed.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.060
A quick list of things that
are new with the Block 5

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.543
is a thermal protective
coating on the whole booster,

00:18:47.543 --> 00:18:49.778
a liquid cooled heat
shield by the engines,

00:18:49.778 --> 00:18:53.824
a bolted Octaweb, 8% increase
in thrust on the first stage,

00:18:53.824 --> 00:18:57.660
upgraded retractable landing
legs, titanium grid fins,

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:01.370
an upgraded COPV 2.0 and a ton of tweaks

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:03.417
that allow it to be even more reusable

00:19:03.417 --> 00:19:07.260
and most importantly,
rated for human flight.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.750
So how can the Falcon 9
booster actually be reflown

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:12.520
without refurbishment?

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.700
Can it?

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.610
What's so different about the Falcon 9

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:17.140
compared to the Space Shuttle?

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:20.200
Well let's first compare it to the SRBs

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.740
and see what it actually does differently.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:26.320
First off, the SRBs
splashed down in salt water.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.480
That's not really a good thing.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.720
Solid Rocket Boosters

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:33.000
are also basically giant empty canisters

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.490
that are loaded up with a
rubber like solid propellant

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:36.400
between each flight.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.230
This is different than a
liquid fueled rocket engine

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:42.250
that has say tens of thousands of parts.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:45.940
If a liquid engine were to
be submerged in salt water,

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.280
I don't think that'd be a good thing.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.990
So right there is probably
the biggest thing,

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:53.640
having a booster land on
dry land or a dry ship deck,

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.420
is a huge leg up

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.110
as far as reusability
and refurbishment goes.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:58.943
As a matter of fact,

00:19:58.943 --> 00:20:02.040
the SRBs were so expensive to refurbish,

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.150
in the long run, it was more
expensive to bring them back,

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.270
tear them down and all that,

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.920
than it was just to build new ones.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.060
So why is the Falcon 9 booster

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.990
more reusable than the Orbiter?

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:17.610
Well first off, the Orbiter
was not only a rocket,

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:21.320
it was also a spaceship that
carried up to seven people.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:25.580
So a lot of work and check
outs went into the cockpit,

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:28.920
the interior, the payload
bay et cetera, et cetera,

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.190
let alone the actual rocket
engine portion of the Orbiter.

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.840
The RS-25 engine, although amazing

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.010
and eventually refurbished on-site,

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:40.320
still required an awful
lot of work to fly again.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.810
The Merlin 1D engine
that SpaceX has developed

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.900
has been fired over 5600 times,

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:49.290
and is designed to be reflown
and reused over and over

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.950
with minimal inspections.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.520
How much, we don't really know yet,

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.230
but more on that in a second.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:56.860
But perhaps the biggest difference

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.700
between the Falcon 9 booster
and the Space Shuttle Orbiter

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.500
is the velocity in
which each one reenters.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.020
Let's compare the velocities of the SRB,

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.570
the Falcon 9 first stage and the Orbiter

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:08.510
to help understand

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:11.380
why each one uses their
given reentry system.

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:15.130
The SRB never exceeds
4800 kilometers an hour

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.460
and it also stays lower in the atmosphere

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.780
so it doesn't require
any kind of slow down

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.470
before it reenters,

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:25.290
well because it never really
exited in the first place.

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:26.500
The Falcon 9 on the other hand

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.882
goes from up to about
8000 kilometers an hour

00:21:28.882 --> 00:21:32.170
down to as low as about
5000 kilometers an hour

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:35.840
in order to survive reentry
using its retropropulsion.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.470
But it's safe to say it
will probably never see

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.930
much more than 8000 kilometers an hour.

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:41.970
The Orbiter reenters

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.450
at speeds of up to
27000 kilometers an hour

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.840
but it slowly bleeds
off a lot of its speed

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.180
in the upper atmosphere.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.013
Wow.

00:21:50.013 --> 00:21:53.080
Those are some pretty big
differences in velocity.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.260
Since the Falcon 9 booster

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.470
reenters at only 8000 kilometers an hour

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:01.440
it experiences up to
almost 40 times less heat

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.050
compared to the Orbiter.

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:04.000
What?

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.040
How can that be?

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.900
Well, since the first
stage of the Falcon 9

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.710
only gets up to at most about
a third of orbital velocity,

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:14.370
it receives much less than just
1/3rd of the amount of heat.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:17.750
The compressed gas on the
leading edge of any vehicle

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:20.910
will see heat increase by velocity squared

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:23.410
but the thermal energy
transferred to the rocket

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:25.460
goes as velocity cubed!

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.720
So that means if a vehicle is
traveling four times faster,

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.090
the bow wave in front
can get 64 times hotter!

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:36.340
'Cause that's four times
faster, times four, so squared,

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:40.760
times another four, cubed, so 64!

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.720
Now this is an oversimplification

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.880
but that's why the Space Shuttle

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.820
needed those carbon-carbon leading edges

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.780
and those silica tiles
all over the bottom of it

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:48.820
to survive reentry.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.580
Not only that, but the Falcon 9

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:54.040
also does an a pretty
significant retropropulsion burn

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.140
before it reenters, to ensure
the vehicle can survive.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.180
The Space Shuttle didn't do any of this

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.630
because it relied on
its large surface area

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:05.340
to slowly bleed the speed
off for several minutes.

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.173
As a matter of fact,

00:23:06.173 --> 00:23:08.660
the Space Shuttle spent almost
10 times the amount of time

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.870
radiating heat off through reentry,

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:14.310
which is the key to how its
non-ablative heat shield worked.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:15.600
So long story short.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.530
The first stage is going slow
enough to not get crazy hot,

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:22.770
so it doesn't require nearly
as much thermal protection.

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:24.960
Therefore it's probably safe to say

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.654
it doesn't require as much
refurbishment, hopefully.

00:23:28.654 --> 00:23:30.790
(upbeat, melodic music)

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:33.130
So some final thoughts on all this.

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:35.660
First off, the reason
why I think the Falcon 9

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.830
will actually achieve reusability

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:39.450
when the Space Shuttle couldn't

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:42.780
is mostly due to the engineering
philosophy of SpaceX.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.110
They are constantly tweaking their rocket,

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.943
to the point where

00:23:45.943 --> 00:23:49.676
according to SpaceX's VP of
production, Andy Lambert,

00:23:49.676 --> 00:23:53.477
SpaceX has "Never built any
two vehicles identically,

00:23:53.477 --> 00:23:56.280
"such is the pace of
innovation at SpaceX."

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.070
Now this is quite different
from the Space Shuttle

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:01.810
that had only only five
operational vehicles

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:05.390
that changed very little in
their 30 years of operation.

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:08.170
As a matter of fact, phase
one of the Space Shuttle

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.780
was only the first four
flights of Columbia.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.350
After that, further
development would be minimal.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.880
But with the Falcon 9, if
an idea doesn't work out,

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.550
they can literally make that change

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:20.090
on one of the next manufactured boosters.

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:21.310
And if it's a really big change,

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:22.980
they'll do that on the
next block iteration.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.810
The Space Shuttle's design
didn't exactly freeze,

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:29.690
but it certainly didn't evolve
nearly as much in 30 years

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:32.210
as the Falcon 9 has in eight years.

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:35.150
Some might consider this
much change reckless,

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:36.810
but considering the end goal

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:39.445
is to actually have a reusable vehicle,

00:24:39.445 --> 00:24:42.730
I'm really glad they're
pushing this aggressively.

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:44.800
I just can't wait another 30 years.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.790
And lastly to those that think SpaceX

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:49.560
won't be able to make it
worth the cost of reflying,

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.530
or who question whether or not
it'll be worth it for them,

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:55.310
luckily for us, it really doesn't matter.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.140
SpaceX is a private company.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.980
They will only do what makes
the most financial sense.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:02.860
So if after a few years
they look back and realize

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.290
it's more expensive to
try to refly these things

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:07.120
than it is to make a new one,

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.660
I'm sure they'll stop doing so,

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.080
because they don't wanna lose money.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.980
They don't owe it to anyone
to reuse their rockets.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:15.610
It's only in their best interest

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:19.090
to figure out how to do so
so they can maximize profits.

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:20.810
And that's just different
than the Space Shuttle

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:24.460
which had the weight of the
entire nation's expectations

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:26.070
to be reusable.

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:29.740
Whether or not the system put
in place actually made sense,

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:30.800
it was too late.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.800
There was no room for
major changes per say

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.367
since Congress would probably frown upon,

00:25:36.367 --> 00:25:39.910
"Well this didn't work out,
let's scrap the entire idea."

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:41.010
So personally,

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:44.350
I think with this new age
of innovation and materials,

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:47.130
rapid evolution of hardware and software,

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:50.230
and leadership that simply
requires they keep trying

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:51.530
until they figure it out,

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:54.100
I think we're finally entering a new era

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.620
of reusable and airliner like rockets.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:58.453
Hopefully!

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.760
So what are your thoughts?

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:06.420
Is actual reusability finally upon us

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.970
or do you think we're
still going to be stuck

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:10.340
in refurbishment land?

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.020
What other questions do you have?

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.990

questions, and video requests

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:16.220
