00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.860
We're back with
Will Smith, and it's

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.443
time to play one of
my favorite games.

00:00:08.443 --> 00:00:10.954
It's called Five Second Rule.

00:00:10.954 --> 00:00:12.151
[CHEERING]

00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:13.942
[MUSIC- CHER, "IF I COULD TURN
 BACK TIME"]

00:00:13.942 --> 00:00:15.442
(SINGING) If I could
turn back time.

00:00:15.442 --> 00:00:17.042
If I could find a way.

00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:18.750
All right, here's
what's going to happen.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.550
tWitch is going to ask us each
to name three things, three

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.720
types of, like,
cars or something,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.720
and we'll have five seconds
to name three things

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.950
and then hit that to see how
much time is left on the clock.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:30.450
OK.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.070
All right?

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.369
If you do it, you get a point.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.160
If time runs out, you
get no points at all.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.580
Five seconds goes
very, very fast.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.080
OK.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.830
I shall go first.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.720
You shall go first.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.640
OK.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.210
Ellen, name three
things you do in a car.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.010
You drive.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.800
You park.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.990
And you say hello to people.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.952
[DING]

00:00:45.952 --> 00:00:47.876
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:50.762
You do when you're waving.

00:00:50.762 --> 00:00:51.724
Hold on.

00:00:51.724 --> 00:00:52.686
Hold on.

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:53.648
Hold on.

00:00:53.648 --> 00:00:54.610
Oh, no.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.271
When you're driving, have you
ever lived in this small town?

00:00:57.271 --> 00:00:57.770
You do.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.760
You wave to people.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.646
All right.

00:01:00.646 --> 00:01:01.500
OK.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.770
I see now we need some,
like, judges or something.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:06.790
Do You drive.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.300
You say hi.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.600
You wink.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.099
You wink.

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:10.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.670
Will, name three things you
should never do in a car.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.372
Never drink, smoke, make love.

00:01:19.372 --> 00:01:20.336
That's not true.

00:01:20.336 --> 00:01:21.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.228
That's not true.

00:01:23.228 --> 00:01:24.200
That's not true.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.566
But you shouldn't do it.

00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.379
I mean, you should
do it at home.

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:27.879
Yeah.

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:29.755
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:32.444
Oh, all right.

00:01:32.444 --> 00:01:33.110
I see it's hard.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.021
It is hard.

00:01:36.021 --> 00:01:39.430
Ellen, tell us three
words you use a lot.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.570
Love, baby, and be kind.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.971

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:46.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.730
Be kind.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.740
I'm going to give you
that one because that's

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.290
the right answer.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.785
That's the right answer.

00:01:49.785 --> 00:01:50.775
Yes, that is right.

00:01:50.775 --> 00:01:52.292
Thank you.

00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:53.250
It's two words, though.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.230
It's two words, yeah.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.020
OK, Will, name your
three favorite songs

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.340
to sing in the shower.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.710
In the shower-- the
Dreamgirls "I'm Telling You."

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.940
[BUZZER]

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.930
Whitney Houston's-- oh, darn.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.812
Yeah, but it's like, [SINGING]
and I am telling you--

00:02:14.812 --> 00:02:16.500
[CHEERING]

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.702
--I'm going.

00:02:18.702 --> 00:02:22.170
You're the best man
I've ever known.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.770
There's no way I could ever
go, no, no, no, no way.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.990
No, no--

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.304
No way I'm living--

00:02:31.304 --> 00:02:32.268
Yeah, that's my song.

00:02:32.268 --> 00:02:32.893
That's my song.

00:02:32.893 --> 00:02:34.678
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:34.678 --> 00:02:37.088
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.260
Oh, god.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.220
Ellen, tell us three
things you'd never

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.510
want to find in your house.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.810
I would not want to find a
snake or an alligator or a bear.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.796
[DING]

00:02:46.796 --> 00:02:48.768
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.130
That sounds like something
your wax statue would say.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.535
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:03.902 --> 00:03:05.620
And then she would dance.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.600
Oh.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.190
All right, Will,
tell us three things

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.830
that can get you
thrown out of a bar.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.160
Fighting, profanity,
and touching people.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:20.076 --> 00:03:21.982
The latter two
happen all the time.

00:03:21.982 --> 00:03:23.350
I know.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.380
That's why you go to a bar.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.246
Ellen, name three things
your wife calls you.

00:03:29.246 --> 00:03:30.980
Thingy, baby, love.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.405
[DING]

00:03:32.405 --> 00:03:34.305
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.240
Not necessarily in that order.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.750
Will, name three things
your kids call you.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.240
Daddy, silly, and goofy.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.890
Zero second left.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.521
I'm not silly or goofy, but
that's what they call me.

00:03:55.521 --> 00:03:57.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.990
Ellen, named three celebrities

00:04:06.098 --> 00:04:08.094
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:15.536 --> 00:04:16.577
I'm laughing [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:16.577 --> 00:04:19.089
That's very good.

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:20.540
That's very exciting.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.546
No, it's good because
we were all like, oh.

00:04:22.546 --> 00:04:24.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.352
I finally came right out, yeah.

00:04:26.352 --> 00:04:31.091
[LAUGHTER] OK

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.300
Will, name three celebrities

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.830
Growing up-- Farrah Fawcett--

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:40.330
[BUZZER]

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.072
Oh, darn it.

00:04:43.072 --> 00:04:48.110
It was Farrah Fawcett,
Michael Jackson.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.475
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:50.385 --> 00:04:51.556
It's funny I can't remember.

00:04:51.556 --> 00:04:52.930
Farrah Fawcett's
the only-- like,

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.807
I think my whole
childhood was like covered

00:04:54.807 --> 00:04:55.640
with Farrah Fawcett.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.650
Farrah Fawcett, yeah.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.252
Yeah.

00:04:57.252 --> 00:04:58.960
I know, until you
really think about it--

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.476
Till you, really-- yeah.

00:04:59.476 --> 00:05:00.310
I'm sure there's more, but--

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.018
There's probably more,
but Farrah Fawcett

00:05:02.018 --> 00:05:04.534
was like the one.

00:05:04.534 --> 00:05:05.968
[DINGING]

00:05:05.968 --> 00:05:06.930
That was it.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.460
We want everyone to play Five
Second Rule with their family

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.250
over the holidays.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.180
So you're all going home with
the game, Five Second Rule.
