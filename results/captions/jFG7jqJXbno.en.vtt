00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:21.309
Good evening.

00:00:22.253 --> 00:00:23.771
The perfect manager.

00:00:23.771 --> 00:00:26.267
Now Benjamin Franklin said,

00:00:26.267 --> 00:00:28.762
"Two things in life are certain.

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:31.002
Death and taxes."

00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:33.538
Now I dare to add a third thing,

00:00:33.538 --> 00:00:35.524
a bad boss.

00:00:35.524 --> 00:00:38.751
You see as human beings
we're getting healthier,

00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:40.505
we're living longer lives,

00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:43.496
we're going end up 
spending 40 maybe 50 years of our life

00:00:43.496 --> 00:00:44.762
at work.

00:00:44.762 --> 00:00:47.254
Now it's almost certain
that during this time

00:00:47.254 --> 00:00:49.757
we'll encounter a bad boss.

00:00:49.757 --> 00:00:54.244
On that note, an American institute 
conducted a study and they found out

00:00:54.244 --> 00:00:59.458
that 60% of American workers
were not engaged in their jobs.

00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:02.514
Now they ask for the main reason why?

00:01:02.514 --> 00:01:04.247
And it was very surprising

00:01:04.247 --> 00:01:07.264
because the main reason
was not low pay,

00:01:07.264 --> 00:01:10.227
the main reason
was not insufficient vacation,

00:01:10.227 --> 00:01:12.984
the main reason was not a poor work place,

00:01:12.984 --> 00:01:17.234
the main reason why this people 
were not engaged in their job

00:01:17.234 --> 00:01:20.718
was because of a bad boss.

00:01:21.227 --> 00:01:24.246
Why is it we have so many employees 

00:01:24.246 --> 00:01:26.510
unsatisfied with their bosses?

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.230
Well,
I think there are two reasons for that.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.028
First of all, 
the day you become a manager 

00:01:32.028 --> 00:01:34.921
your job changes totally.

00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:37.530
When you're an employee,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.765
your performance is defined
by your own work.

00:01:40.765 --> 00:01:42.990
And it doesn't really matter what you do,

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.150
whether you're an engineer,
on the shop floor,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.766
or whether you're a cleaner.

00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:51.274
You're in a universe
centered on the need of one person.

00:01:51.274 --> 00:01:52.760
Yourself.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.507
Well the day you become a manager
you realize your performance

00:01:57.507 --> 00:02:01.260
is defined by the work 
that others are doing:

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.527
Your team.

00:02:02.527 --> 00:02:07.527
So all of a sudden,
it's not about what you're doing,

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:09.274
it's about what they're doing.

00:02:09.274 --> 00:02:12.501
It's not about your performance,
it's about their performance.

00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:15.254
And it's not about what you need,

00:02:15.254 --> 00:02:18.256
it's about what they need.

00:02:19.736 --> 00:02:21.256
See if you're an engineer,

00:02:21.256 --> 00:02:24.264
your job is to design products.

00:02:24.264 --> 00:02:25.468
If you're a cleaner,

00:02:25.468 --> 00:02:28.487
you will be measured 
by the cleanliness you leave behind.

00:02:28.487 --> 00:02:33.244
But if you're a manager of engineers,
or a manager of the cleaning force,

00:02:33.244 --> 00:02:35.248
you don't have to engineer or clean,

00:02:35.248 --> 00:02:37.766
what you have to do 
is to get the right team together,

00:02:37.766 --> 00:02:40.018
you have to create
a high performance culture,

00:02:40.018 --> 00:02:42.494
you have to make them more productive,

00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:45.625
and you have to create an environment 
where people just love to work

00:02:45.625 --> 00:02:47.728
and love to give their best.

00:02:47.728 --> 00:02:51.749
So first of all, being a manager 
is a totally different job.

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:55.251
Now somebody gets appointed manager
and a person doesn't get it.

00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:59.525
He doesn't realize
that it is mostly about growing others.

00:03:00.485 --> 00:03:04.491
That person is going to have a tough time
becoming a good manager.

00:03:04.491 --> 00:03:06.766
Now the second reason why I believe,

00:03:06.766 --> 00:03:09.248
people are not satisfied 
with their bosses,

00:03:09.248 --> 00:03:13.499
is because we are simply not educated 
to become managers.

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:15.753
Let me take you 
through some of the concepts

00:03:15.753 --> 00:03:18.034
we're learning in university and school.

00:03:18.034 --> 00:03:21.761
Well, first of all,
we learn a hierarchical model

00:03:23.775 --> 00:03:26.767
"I am the teacher, 
I give the grades

00:03:26.767 --> 00:03:29.756
and you'll have to do your homework."

00:03:29.756 --> 00:03:31.749
"But why?"

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:34.232
"Because I said so."

00:03:34.232 --> 00:03:38.754
See if this is how you treat adults
in a business environment,

00:03:38.754 --> 00:03:41.020
you won't get their top performance,

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.003
you can't motivate a team 
to deliver a top performance

00:03:44.003 --> 00:03:47.252
just by your authority or your title.

00:03:50.492 --> 00:03:54.512
See, people will follow you
through thick and thin,

00:03:54.512 --> 00:03:57.737
if you inspire them,
if you do something great.

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:00.495
If you convince them 
or if you care about them.

00:04:00.495 --> 00:04:04.233
But they will not do it
just because you're the CEO.

00:04:04.233 --> 00:04:07.739
They will work for you 
but they'll not give it their all.

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.512
Now isn't that a pity?

00:04:09.512 --> 00:04:12.751
Another thing we learn in school 
is we learn to look at problems

00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:14.497
from every possible angle,

00:04:14.497 --> 00:04:17.747
and then develop the best solution.

00:04:17.747 --> 00:04:20.247
Often a very theoretical one.

00:04:20.247 --> 00:04:22.479
In business, by contrast,

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.770
success is mostly defined 
by rapid implementation

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.756
and not by the best solution.

00:04:27.756 --> 00:04:33.100
In fact we rarely have time
to even look at the best solution.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.954
Now in schools and in universities

00:04:34.954 --> 00:04:39.491
there is a huge misconception
about risk taking

00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:41.506
and about making mistakes.

00:04:41.506 --> 00:04:45.264
You see, if you make a mistake 
you'll being punished.

00:04:45.264 --> 00:04:47.774
You get a low grade for instance.

00:04:47.774 --> 00:04:51.450
Now, as a result we're educated,

00:04:52.531 --> 00:04:54.985
to not try anything new.

00:04:54.985 --> 00:04:59.199
We're not taking risks
because we might fail.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.231
But failure, ladies and gentlemen,
is necessary for success

00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:07.508
and necessary for personal development.

00:05:07.508 --> 00:05:11.004
Take Steve Jobs, 
he was fired as CEO of Apple.

00:05:11.004 --> 00:05:14.506
As CEO of the company he founded.

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:18.269
What a personal failure.

00:05:18.512 --> 00:05:20.522
Yet he himself said years later,

00:05:20.522 --> 00:05:24.261
"It was the best thing
that could have ever happen to me.

00:05:24.261 --> 00:05:27.519
Because I entered the most creative period
of my life."

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:29.497
And the positive results of that period

00:05:29.497 --> 00:05:31.759
all those wonderful devices
Apple created,

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.767
stays with us as we speak.

00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:36.005
Michael Jordan,
the basketball icon said,

00:05:36.005 --> 00:05:38.239
"I can forgive failure.

00:05:38.239 --> 00:05:40.496
Everybody fails at something.

00:05:40.496 --> 00:05:43.271
What I cannot forgive is not trying."

00:05:43.271 --> 00:05:45.983
But we're not educated to try.

00:05:46.756 --> 00:05:49.991
What we learn in school 
is we learn to serve ourselves.

00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:52.992
It's all about improving
our individual grades,

00:05:52.992 --> 00:05:56.267
about maximizing our chances 
to get a good job.

00:05:56.267 --> 00:05:59.834
It's all about me, myself and I.

00:06:01.974 --> 00:06:04.261
By contrast leadership,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:07.063
is about serving others.

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:10.711
So you see, 
we're not educated to become managers.

00:06:11.492 --> 00:06:13.253
If you want to become an engineer,

00:06:13.253 --> 00:06:15.358
you go to school,
you learn math and physics,

00:06:15.358 --> 00:06:17.769
you go to university,
you get an engineering degree

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:20.055
and you're perfectly
prepared to start your job,

00:06:20.055 --> 00:06:21.267
as an engineer.

00:06:21.267 --> 00:06:24.504
If you want to become a manager,
you can do the same things,

00:06:24.504 --> 00:06:26.508
but the day you'll start your job

00:06:26.508 --> 00:06:29.000
you'll realize you're totally unprepared.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.244
There was no class on leadership.

00:06:31.244 --> 00:06:34.511
Nobody taught you how to create
a high performance culture.

00:06:34.511 --> 00:06:37.756
And by the way what on Earth is that?

00:06:37.756 --> 00:06:41.509
Nobody taught you
how to pick the best person for the job.

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:45.252
Remember, you have
to set the team together.

00:06:45.252 --> 00:06:46.923
How to pick the right candidate?

00:06:46.923 --> 00:06:49.509
And nobody told you how to get rid,

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:52.480
how to let go
of the wrong people in your team.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.776
How to fire with decency.

00:06:56.505 --> 00:07:01.512
How do you give straight feedback
without demolishing the other person,

00:07:01.512 --> 00:07:04.277
by actually helping the other person.

00:07:06.777 --> 00:07:10.258
You realize the day you become a manager,

00:07:11.028 --> 00:07:13.233
you're bound to fail.

00:07:13.233 --> 00:07:14.485
So no wonder.

00:07:14.485 --> 00:07:18.248
60% of American workers
are not satisfied with their bosses.

00:07:18.248 --> 00:07:21.225
Now what happens when you start a job,

00:07:21.225 --> 00:07:23.249
and you're not really prepared
for the job?

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:27.084
Say, we're naming you
director of a heard of camels,

00:07:27.084 --> 00:07:29.509
and the director of the camels
will address the job

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:31.778
to travel with the camels
through the desert.

00:07:31.778 --> 00:07:34.013
Now two possible reactions
in a human being:

00:07:34.013 --> 00:07:37.071
One is, "Wow, what a cool thing!"

00:07:37.071 --> 00:07:39.764
And the other one is fear.

00:07:39.764 --> 00:07:43.262
Now fear in a manager
is a recipe for disaster.

00:07:44.247 --> 00:07:47.264
Because instead of seeing opportunities,

00:07:47.264 --> 00:07:49.546
you see threats.

00:07:49.546 --> 00:07:52.514
And you want to protect
all that you have.

00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:54.730
Your ego tells you,

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.016
protect everything you have achieved.

00:07:57.016 --> 00:07:59.746
So you start kissing up,

00:07:59.746 --> 00:08:01.271
kicking down,

00:08:01.271 --> 00:08:03.030
you don't encourage others to grow,

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.043
you remove every person out of your way

00:08:05.043 --> 00:08:07.253
that could be a potential threat.

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:10.235
Now isn't that wonderful?

00:08:10.235 --> 00:08:11.501
It's a nightmare.

00:08:11.501 --> 00:08:13.518
It's a nightmare for your business,

00:08:13.518 --> 00:08:15.515
because in the long-term you'll ruin it,

00:08:15.515 --> 00:08:19.831
and it's an emotional nightmare
for the people involved.

00:08:20.239 --> 00:08:22.524
But fear in a manager, 
ladies and gentlemen,

00:08:22.524 --> 00:08:25.252
comes mostly from the fact

00:08:25.252 --> 00:08:28.255
that that person 
is not prepared for the job.

00:08:28.255 --> 00:08:31.625
That's why he or she is afraid.

00:08:32.753 --> 00:08:34.495
Now what do I advise you to do?

00:08:34.495 --> 00:08:37.234
I advise you learn as much as possible,

00:08:37.234 --> 00:08:40.850
learn as fast as possible
before you become a manager.

00:08:41.759 --> 00:08:44.972
Look at sports, look at team sports.

00:08:44.972 --> 00:08:46.518
This is a football team.

00:08:46.518 --> 00:08:48.007
Now for the American friends,

00:08:48.007 --> 00:08:50.241
when I see football what I mean is soccer.

00:08:50.241 --> 00:08:52.508
Extremely popular in Europe.

00:08:52.508 --> 00:08:54.517
These are the players on the field, right.

00:08:54.517 --> 00:08:56.496
They are the ones working.

00:08:56.496 --> 00:08:58.233
There's a team manager,

00:08:58.233 --> 00:09:00.261
there's a clear goal to win the game,

00:09:00.261 --> 00:09:03.246
and there's a clear strategy
on how to win the game.

00:09:03.246 --> 00:09:05.241
It's the same in business.

00:09:05.241 --> 00:09:07.247
Now every professional sports team

00:09:07.247 --> 00:09:10.242
has a high performance culture.

00:09:10.242 --> 00:09:12.744
What on Earth is a culture in business?

00:09:12.744 --> 00:09:15.255
It's not taking your team to the opera.

00:09:15.255 --> 00:09:17.980
Culture in business 
is the way people behave

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.751
in your organization.

00:09:20.751 --> 00:09:22.757
If your culture is based on innovation,

00:09:22.757 --> 00:09:27.433
most likely people in your organization
will welcome fresh ideas.

00:09:27.763 --> 00:09:30.263
Whatever why do they do that.

00:09:30.263 --> 00:09:34.531
So, here are the parallels to business.

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:39.756
Everybody in a sports team knows,

00:09:39.756 --> 00:09:41.969
it's about winning the game.

00:09:41.969 --> 00:09:45.024
The president knows it
and the cleaner knows it.

00:09:45.024 --> 00:09:48.035
Now I encourage you in your business
go to the accountants' team,

00:09:48.035 --> 00:09:49.511
and ask an accountant

00:09:49.511 --> 00:09:53.018
if they know 
it's about winning against the competitors,

00:09:53.018 --> 00:09:55.262
if they know who the competitors are,

00:09:55.262 --> 00:09:58.784
and if that accountant knows 
that his work counts.

00:09:58.784 --> 00:10:01.508
That he is actually competing

00:10:01.508 --> 00:10:05.505
against the accountant
in the competitors organization.

00:10:05.505 --> 00:10:08.001
Or maybe your accountant thinks,

00:10:08.001 --> 00:10:09.025
"We aren't competing,

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:10.256
sales is competing,

00:10:10.256 --> 00:10:12.023
there are the ones out there."

00:10:12.023 --> 00:10:13.256
But that's wrong.

00:10:13.256 --> 00:10:15.764
Because everybody in a company matters,

00:10:15.764 --> 00:10:18.036
and everybody is competing,

00:10:18.036 --> 00:10:20.768
whether you know it or not.

00:10:20.768 --> 00:10:22.757
Now speaking of individual performance,

00:10:22.757 --> 00:10:25.747
what I love about sports is

00:10:25.747 --> 00:10:28.741
individual performance is highly visible.

00:10:28.741 --> 00:10:32.747
Anybody can see
who the top players are out there,

00:10:32.747 --> 00:10:35.276
and anybody can see 
who doesn't deliver.

00:10:35.276 --> 00:10:36.764
What happens in business,

00:10:36.764 --> 00:10:40.271
we tend to put this veil 
over the performance issue.

00:10:40.271 --> 00:10:43.488
We act as if everybody 
delivers the same performance.

00:10:43.488 --> 00:10:45.748
It's funny because people 
in a team know exactly

00:10:45.748 --> 00:10:47.244
who the top performers are

00:10:47.244 --> 00:10:48.734
and who the low performers are.

00:10:48.734 --> 00:10:50.753
So when we're paying everybody the same,

00:10:50.753 --> 00:10:52.501
what we're actually doing,

00:10:52.501 --> 00:10:55.255
is we're encouraging low performance.

00:10:55.255 --> 00:10:57.760
It's not a high performance culture,

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.533
it's a low performance culture.

00:10:59.533 --> 00:11:01.985
Now imagine, this kind of red t-shirt,

00:11:01.985 --> 00:11:05.247
Cristiano Ronaldo, 
the best football player in the world,

00:11:05.247 --> 00:11:07.483
imagine him having the same salary

00:11:07.483 --> 00:11:08.979
like somebody else from his team

00:11:08.979 --> 00:11:11.244
who mostly sits on the bench.

00:11:11.244 --> 00:11:12.736
In sports it's not possible.

00:11:12.736 --> 00:11:16.772
Because anybody can see 
how good this guy is.

00:11:18.504 --> 00:11:20.476
What I love about sports,

00:11:20.476 --> 00:11:22.744
is their obsession with training.

00:11:22.744 --> 00:11:25.146
You see, when they're not competing,

00:11:25.146 --> 00:11:26.259
they're training.

00:11:26.259 --> 00:11:29.743
Three, four, sometimes six times a week.

00:11:29.743 --> 00:11:33.497
Now when was the last time 
you improved your business skills?

00:11:33.497 --> 00:11:35.237
And how often do you do it?

00:11:35.237 --> 00:11:37.009
Is it once a day, once a week,

00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:40.817
once a month, once a year,
once every five years?

00:11:42.036 --> 00:11:43.217
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:11:43.217 --> 00:11:47.246
in a business environment 
that is driven by change and uncertainty,

00:11:47.246 --> 00:11:50.768
training has to be an ongoing activity,

00:11:50.768 --> 00:11:54.477
and it has to be enforced by the managers.

00:11:55.756 --> 00:11:57.763
Look, every sports team has a captain,

00:11:57.763 --> 00:12:01.743
the captain is the leader on the field.

00:12:01.743 --> 00:12:03.771
And the way they pick their captains,

00:12:03.771 --> 00:12:06.503
is they choose the best leader.

00:12:06.503 --> 00:12:10.248
Seldomly, the captain is the best player.

00:12:10.248 --> 00:12:13.773
This is Puyol,
from Football Club Barcelona.

00:12:13.773 --> 00:12:15.769
He's not the best player there.

00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:18.515
There are shinier stars
like Lionel Messi and Iniesta

00:12:18.515 --> 00:12:19.770
and you name them.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:23.038
But he is the best leader.

00:12:23.261 --> 00:12:27.491
Now in buniness, what happens is 
we take the best consulter

00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:30.236
and we make him 
head of the consulting team,

00:12:30.236 --> 00:12:32.015
instead of picking the best leader.

00:12:32.015 --> 00:12:36.512
Often in business, the promotion 
goes to the boss' friend,

00:12:36.512 --> 00:12:39.508
or to the one kissing his rear,

00:12:39.508 --> 00:12:43.851
causing frustration and stagnation 
to the rest of the company.

00:12:44.243 --> 00:12:48.463
Now this is a concept 
we have to take to business.

00:12:48.744 --> 00:12:51.519
If we make individual performance 
highly visible,

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:52.760
this wouldn't happen.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.028
See in sports,

00:12:54.028 --> 00:12:56.525
if the team manager name somebody captain,

00:12:56.525 --> 00:12:59.263
and that person doesn't deliver,

00:12:59.263 --> 00:13:02.249
mass media will kill them both.

00:13:02.249 --> 00:13:05.267
Why? 
Because performance is highly visible.

00:13:05.267 --> 00:13:08.246
And all of a sudden, things fall in place.

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:11.496
A cool thing they do in sports,
is when they win.

00:13:11.496 --> 00:13:15.497
Boy, they celebrate 
like there's no tomorrow.

00:13:16.261 --> 00:13:18.512
And this is something 
we should do in business.

00:13:18.512 --> 00:13:21.255
You know, there should be room for joy.

00:13:21.255 --> 00:13:25.262
When a team delivers top performance,

00:13:25.262 --> 00:13:27.749
you have to reward them with money,

00:13:27.749 --> 00:13:29.245
hug their soul,

00:13:29.245 --> 00:13:32.753
celebrate with a team
not only because they deserve it,

00:13:32.753 --> 00:13:36.354
celebrate because it makes them stronger.

00:13:37.503 --> 00:13:38.513
So what I'm saying,

00:13:38.513 --> 00:13:42.251
is take these five concepts from sports

00:13:42.251 --> 00:13:43.509
and put them to business.

00:13:43.509 --> 00:13:45.489
The high performance culture.

00:13:45.489 --> 00:13:49.167
The extremely visible 
individual performance.

00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:52.240
The obsession with training.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.259
The way they pick their true leaders
and not the fake ones.

00:13:56.259 --> 00:13:59.237
And the way they celebrate.

00:13:59.237 --> 00:14:00.501
Now somebody might say,

00:14:00.501 --> 00:14:02.756
"Hm, the perfect boss,

00:14:02.756 --> 00:14:05.260
come on, that doesn't exist,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.030
because after all nobody is perfect."

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.243
And you're right.

00:14:09.243 --> 00:14:11.740
Nobody is perfect.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.519
But when it comes to goal setting,

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:17.243
I'd rather try and be a perfect boss,

00:14:17.243 --> 00:14:20.529
than to strive to be a mediocre one.

00:14:20.529 --> 00:14:23.250
And speaking of excellent managers,

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:26.741
this, ladies and gentlemen,
is Pep Guardiola.

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:30.508
He's former team manager
of the Football Club Barcelona.

00:14:30.508 --> 00:14:33.738
During the four years 
he was there as a team manager,

00:14:33.738 --> 00:14:37.250
his club entered sixteen competitions

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:40.232
out of which they won fourteen.

00:14:40.232 --> 00:14:43.017
They won the competition not the game.

00:14:43.017 --> 00:14:45.486
A stellar performance.

00:14:45.486 --> 00:14:47.250
Now what I've found very fascinating,

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:52.499
is what Mister Guardiola told his team, 
the first time he met them.

00:14:52.499 --> 00:14:56.221
He said, 
"I don't expect you to win titles.

00:14:56.221 --> 00:14:59.231
I expect you to give it all.

00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:03.236
And when you've given it all you've got
and we lose,

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:05.266
I will defend you.

00:15:05.266 --> 00:15:07.257
But if you don't give it all you've got,

00:15:07.257 --> 00:15:09.979
then you're in the wrong team."

00:15:09.979 --> 00:15:12.035
What a beautiful thing to say.

00:15:12.035 --> 00:15:13.750
Because ladies and gentlemen,

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.758
for imperfect human beings like us,

00:15:16.758 --> 00:15:19.492
giving it all we've got,

00:15:19.492 --> 00:15:22.999
is the highest level of perfection 
we can achieve.

00:15:22.999 --> 00:15:25.265
When we've given it all we've got,

00:15:25.265 --> 00:15:28.490
we are as perfect as we can be.

00:15:29.768 --> 00:15:32.668
So being a perfect manager,

00:15:33.498 --> 00:15:36.025
at home, at work,

00:15:36.225 --> 00:15:37.756
at whatever you do,

00:15:37.756 --> 00:15:39.272
at whatever we do,

00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:41.775
lies only within ourselves.

00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:44.493
The perfect manager, the perfect boss,

00:15:44.493 --> 00:15:46.517
lies within you.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.483
Thank you.

00:15:48.483 --> 00:15:50.291
(Applause)
