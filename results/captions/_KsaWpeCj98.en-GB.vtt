00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.880
# Oh, say can you see...? #

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.120
Get him on the ground.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.960
HE GROANS
Get him on the ground.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.840
Sir!

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.240
It is the number one public health
challenge of our time.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.280
Sir!

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.840
Pulse.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.160
MAN CONTINUES TO GROAN

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.640
It's not a poor people thing
any more, it's not a inner-city

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.200
ghetto drug any more,
it's everywhere.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.240
It's hard to even recognise some
of these people when they've lost

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.640
a lot of their humanity down here.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.360
Tomorrow's not a promise.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.840
It's not heroin that's
killing our people, it's fentanyl.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.200
MUSIC: Star-Spangled Banner

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.920
I'm not going to die from this.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.160
Like, I'm not.
Not going to die from this.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.440
It was like, we went from
20 overdoses to 80 overdoses

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.400
in the matter of a month and we
were like, "What the hell happened?"

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.360
# In the land of the free... #

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.360
I feel like it's a waste
of my life,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.520
it's a fucking
waste of everything.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.000
# And the home of the... #

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.080
I would say that fentanyl
is the Horseman of the Apocalypse,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.680
and it's the one named Death.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.080

SIRENS WAIL

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.880
For decades, Interstate 95
has been notorious for its role

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.520
in the illegal
drug trade in America.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.280
Stretching from Florida to Maine,
this corridor gives cartels

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.280
easy entry to major cities.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.360
We first met Anna two years ago.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.960
She was a new resident

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.200
on Baltimore's backstreets
of addiction.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.520
A lot of people walking by.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.320
All right, come on...

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.960
SHE YELPS

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.200
Do not do that!

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.200
Dude, you scratched me!

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.480
Are you OK?

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.960
Little bit of a rush?

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.400
Anna was recently released from jail
after serving two weeks

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.560
for prostitution -
which means two weeks on no heroin.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.160
What time is it? And since then,
she claims to have only taken pills.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.600
What time is it?

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.000
Is there something in it?
Barely.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.720
If you want it, I'll go grab it...

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.320
The last two years,
I guess nothing's changed

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.920
but everything's changed.
I know that sounds really weird

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.440
but I'm still down here,

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.600
I'm still jumping
from house to house.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.320
I'm still with the same guy.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.640
I feel a little trapped.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.760
I'm scared to shoot up again
but I know eventually

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.560
I probably will if I stay down here.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.560
I'm not sure
if I see my future right now.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.280
I mean really when
I think about it, I don't know

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.080
what I'm going to do in three years,
I don't know what I'm going

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.720
to do tomorrow, I don't know
what I'm going to do in an hour.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.080
I mean, all I can do is hope
that I'll do the right thing,

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.040
you know, and not
what I'm doing now.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.640
This is gang-run west Baltimore,

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.040
the epicentre of Baltimore's
opioid epidemic.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.880
Patty, a former addict,
formed Angels of Addiction

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.560
just after her son died
of a heroin overdose.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.800
Here, walk on my feet.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.840
A lifeline to the lost,
she has fed and clothed addicts

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.120
and their families
on these streets for years.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.720
Any time, 24/7.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.400
I lost my only son in 2002,
and God blessed me with many,

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.360
many children and
it's an honour to serve them

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.160
and they're very precious people,
a lot suffer from the disease

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.160
of addiction, it's a very big
problem, an epidemic here.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.720
I could never count throughout
the years how many people

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:33.120
that I've helped or known
that have died from this disease.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.720
At least 100 people
in the last few years.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.360
It's sad because they're my...

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.280
You know, next time we come,
somebody might say,

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.320
oh, so-and-so didn't make it.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.160
That happens often.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.280
Especially since this
fentanyl has been out.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.480
Fentanyl is very dangerous,
because it's stronger

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.040
than the heroin and people are
overdosing on it and it's, you know,

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.040
really scary and very
alarming and we're...

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.080
We're losing a lot of people.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.400
I chase fentanyl,
I chase carfentanil

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.800
because it's the only dope
I can feel any more.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.160
But it is a big problem,
because it's so powerful,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.520
people that have been clean
for years and just recently decided

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.280
to relapse, erm, they end up OD-ing.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.920
You know,
off of a half or a quarter pill.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.120
That's what it is, it's not heroin.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.040
I used to get high,
I don't get high no more.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.440
I'm just addicted to the cut,
fentanyl.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.040
They stick it in capsules
and then you stick

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.520
it in your arm,
not knowing what you're getting.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.200
And it could be a little bit
of nothing or a whole lot

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.200
of too much.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.280
And I've had friends drop...

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.080
Several, more than several,

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.880
handfuls, that have had
a little bit too much.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.360
Every day coming down here,
seeing my friends,

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.800
I would hear about one of them
overdosing or dying.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.160
It's very dangerous and
it's killing a lot of people.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.600
The sickness of addiction
is when you hear people overdosing

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:45.120
and dying, the addict wants to know,
where's that stuff?

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.120
Because they want the stronger,
longer-lasting stuff.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.280
But they don't realise
that that's that next hit,

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.760
that may be the last.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.880
The bottle's empty.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.960
Thank you, ma'am. I appreciate it.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.960
Probably nine out of ten people
do fentanyl and don't even know it.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.560
None of us know what we're doing.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.680
A lot of the people that we know
either died or moved

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.040
or went to jail.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.080
Some go to rehab
but they always come back.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.400
Everyone out here
is hooked on fentanyl.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.400
It's not really so much the heroin,
like I said, it's not even in it.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.520
The fentanyl's what
everybody's into it now.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.040
I said I'm not going to leave
my boyfriend ever.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.560
And if he's down here,
I'm down here.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.600
Either he goes to jail,
or I go to jail,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.800
we've never been clean together
since I've been with him.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.640
Well, since we've gotten high.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.720
She said she hasn't used
no needles, so I'm proud

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.480
of her, she's been doing good.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.800
But she always threatens me,
so that's her threat,

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.680
and that would make my heart,
I told her it would break my heart.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.440
We meet Anna as she searches
for her morning fix.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.960
Addiction seems to be fighting back.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.480
Hi.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.480
Hiya. Hiya.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.960
Yes, I'm fine,
you don't have to ask.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.280
SHE MUMBLES

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.280
I'm fine.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.040
How was your night?

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.320
Great!

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.400
Tell us what happened?
Nothing.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.880
The last thing I feel like doing
is fucking talking right now.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.600
Yeah, I'm still here.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.160
Anna and Dave squat in abandoned
houses, moving frequently to avoid

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.120
being found by landlords or police.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:05.040
The landlord actually ended up
coming while we were inside

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.520
so we had to hurry up and go hide
in one of the rooms

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.160
and then escape out the house
when he wasn't looking.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.640
So I again got
interrupted on my sleep.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.480
What did you spend your money on?

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.120
I got a pill, he got a pill
and then we each bought crack

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.120
after we got our deal.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.680
That we needed, like gas and stuff.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.040
What were the pills?

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.400
I don't know, dope?

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.400
What else?

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.640
Then you said you had to go
get some more money,

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.720
how did you do that?

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.000
Go and get a date.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.760
Anna prostitutes herself
for the money needed to buy drugs

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.920
for herself and her boyfriend Dave.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.640
It never ends, you know?

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.640
I wasn't even
planning on going outside.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.160
It's just that we didn't
have any money.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:15.200
So because of that,
it took me for ever to get a date.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.600
What time of day were
you out trying to get a date?

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.960
It was night-time.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.120
What time of night?

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.720
Something like five in the morning.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.520
But I didn't go until
like one in the morning.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:37.720
I can't remember,
but I usually go in and out,

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.320
I don't just...

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.480
What I mean is I usually go outside,
I'll get a date then I hurry.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.920
Get the money, either rob them
or just do a super date

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.560
and come back home and then
I go back out, before morning.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.520
Or it depends, sometimes I
don't even know I want to do drugs

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.640
and we hang out.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.560
Most people, when they are 23,
have a goal in life,

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.520
have wishes, desires.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.360
Do you have any?

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.360
No.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.000
I don't plan no more.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.560
Why not?

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.400
I guess because it's like
too late to fix.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.920
Anna still claims that
she has not injected heroin

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.320
since her release from jail.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.640
Her body tells a different story.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.960
She heads off in search for a place
to stay for the night.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.400
But that wasn't her first priority.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.480
I was just sniffing it just to try
it and make sure the powder's...

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.080
Like, heroin's bitter,
but fentanyl has kind of like got

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.480
a sweeter taste to it.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.680
Anna is back in the
full grip of her addiction.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.400
I don't know how to live
in any other way no more.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.640
Am I wrong?

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.880
Like, we don't know what else to do,
do you understand?

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.280
Like, when people break their arm
and legs,

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.560
they need rehab to walk.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.120
Like, we need rehab to learn
how to live, like all over again.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.200
Name's Nathan O'Brien.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.360
I'm from Kentucky.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.880
My name is Olivia Light,
I'm from Ojai, California.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.840
My name's Ed, I'm from
New Haven, Connecticut.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.200
I'm Johnny Montasanno,
I'm from Long Island, New York.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.800
My name's Al, I'm from Ocean County,
New Jersey.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.280
My name's Joe Wilkins,
I'm from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.320
My name's Tommy,
I'm from Birmingham, Alabama.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.960
My name's Millie,
I'm from Currituck, North Carolina.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.400
I'm addicted to heroin.
I was addicted to heroin

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.680
and prescription opiates.
I was addicted to heroin.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.440
I struggled with heroin
for four years.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.960
I'm a recovering heroin addict.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.280
I struggle with prescription
pills and heroin.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.240
My addiction was
pain pills and heroin.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.520
I struggled with heroin.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.280
Over the course of the last
two years, I wouldn't say

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.520
that it got better.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.240
I would say that it's gotten worse.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.520
We see more and more patients
coming in that have experienced

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.120
multiple overdoses
prior to coming in.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.320
I really don't see an end in it.

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.960
I don't see it getting
better at all.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.800
Jodi has dealt with the
opioid crisis since she was a child.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.560
Her mother is a lifelong addict.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.440
And she now runs an addiction
recovery centre in Florida.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:51.840
This addiction changed me
from being a talented,

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.080
ambitious young kid

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.280
into basically a degenerate,
just a shadow.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.360
It took my family,
my friends, my freedom.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.640
It took everything.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:07.040
My addiction took my self-worth,
my dignity, my self-respect.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.640
My health, my friends and family,
my education, money.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.040
What are they going to do with me?

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.920
I couldn't get a job,
I couldn't keep the job.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:18.400
Most of my family members
consider me dead.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:25.680
I'm thankful that we have a place
where patients can come,

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.760
seek help in a safe environment

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:35.960
to start working on the reasons
why they turn to drugs.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:48.920
But every single day
it's a multitude of new people.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:58.360
It's like the floodgates have opened
and it's just non-stop.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.440
I've been clean
for four and a half years.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.280
And two months,
I'll have five years.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.440
Currently, I've been clean
over 100 days.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.680
Just over one year.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.760
I've been clean for,
the 23rd of this month,

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.000
it will be 60 days.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.520
Since March 20, 2017.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.800
I mean, the date resonates
in my brain, March 19, 2016.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.000
That's when I got clean
and it wasn't easy,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.080
but it was the most glorious
experience of my life.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.880
Brittney seems to have travelled
a long way from her days

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.280
of addiction.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.360
But the beaches of Jacksonville,
Florida are only a couple of hours'

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.200
drive from Orlando,
where Jodi first introduced

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.400
us to Brittney two years ago.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.000
When Brittney admitted to
The Recovery Village,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.120
she absolutely was
ready for treatment

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:46.240
and admitted the fact
that she had an addiction problem.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:51.480
She had OD'd several times -
very, very close calls -

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.320
and she was ready.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.200
I'm addicted to heroin.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.320
SHE SOBS

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.640
I want to stop, but I can't.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:15.400
It's that right here - I remember
thinking how would it feel

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.200
if my mother would have seen me
at her kitchen table,

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.840
where, you know,
I grew up eating at.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:26.360
I don't know, it's just when
you're in addiction, you don't care.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.280
Find the Narcan, find the Narcan.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:36.600
Seeing that video,

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:41.240
watching her at this table...

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.000
..and nodding off as they call it,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.120
nodding and falling asleep

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.640
and then pretty much
drooling, it was horrible.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.320
It was really devastating
to see that.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:06.880
I was sick for three months,
like, throwing up constantly.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.480
I thought it was a bad flu.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.800
I got all these different
tests done,

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.840
one of them was a pregnancy test.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.560
I remember her coming back
and telling me, "You're positive."

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.200
And I was like,
"I'm positive for what?"

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.000
And she told me I was pregnant
and I immediately started bawling.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.080
Brittney had a baby girl,
beautiful, sweet baby girl.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.120
Say cheese, baby, say cheese.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:38.320
And about a month after that,
sadly, Brittney relapsed again.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:45.880
And this was very devastating.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.800
My mom...

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.720
Me and my mom got in a
fight earlier in that morning.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:03.120
My mom said some things
she didn't mean and I was already

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.520
in a very bad mental place.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:10.600
I went out to get formula
and ended up at a gas station

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:14.800
and an old dealer ended up
being at that same gas station.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:19.360
Ended up purchasing a bag,
but I came home and we had a nice

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.080
dinner, held my baby,
I sat right here.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:26.320
We had been sitting
here at the table,

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:31.840
chitchatting and the baby
was snoozing.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:37.560
Brittney had asked me, that
she wanted to go to the bathroom.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:41.400
So the baby started
waking up and I held the baby.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.640
Then Brittney was in the bathroom.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.280
I remember sitting on the toilet
and talking to my mom

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.760
from the living room.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.120
And I snorted the whole bag.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:58.760
My mom's in the other
room with my child and,

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:04.000
and I just kind of nodded off
and I felt OK for a little bit.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.520
And my mom's voice got distant
and then everything went black.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:13.640
And I had the baby in my arms
and I go into the bathroom

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:20.840
and she is passed out, gurgling
and drooling from the mouth,

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.840
leaning against the wall,
sitting on the toilet.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:24.840
Um...

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.800
It was devastating, it was scary.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:36.440
I had to get her to wake up
and I ran into the living room,

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.120
the baby was sleeping again.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:46.120
I put her down in her little bed
and ran back into the bathroom

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.600
shaking and screaming at Brittney
and smacking her on her face

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.760
to try to get her to come out of it.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:56.560
And she'd finally came out of it,
I'm at the same time trying

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.680
to call 911.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:02.000
And came out of it to my mom
holding my baby in her arms,

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.080
on the phone with paramedics,
trying to bring me to.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.560
I just felt nothing but anger.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.880
Anger, frustration again,

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:17.640
and I really, I was so angry at her,
so angry and so hurt,

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.800
and so confused how
she could do that.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.880
I did not know what happened.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.760
But once I started
putting things together,

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.280
I was just kind of
in disbelief at myself.

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.280
So...

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:39.240
I wasn't thinking about my daughter,
I wasn't, I didn't care about my mom

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.680
or how she felt.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.880
I just felt so depressed.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.720
And not good enough,
like, I just felt like my daughter

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.840
didn't deserve me.
She deserved better.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:55.000
I felt like my mother
could raise her,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.520
I mean, it's just...

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.600
But, yeah.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:09.600
You just don't think
that they're going do this again,

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.840
especially now,
especially with a baby,

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:17.480
especially knowing
that you have that beautiful

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.600
little baby, how could do you this?

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:26.600
This drug pulls them in,
like none other.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.520
It steals their dreams,
it steals their lives.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:39.520
It's almost stole my grandbaby's
mother from us again.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:49.200
I've told Brittney that one
of the saddest things I would ever

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.640
have to do would be to have to tell

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:58.600
my granddaughter about her mother,

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:05.640
that her mother was an addict,
and she tried very hard to get

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:11.240
past this addiction,
but was unable to,

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.240
and died from it.

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:27.080
In 2017, we had just under 72,000
Americans die of drug overdoses.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.320
Jay, Jay look at me.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.960
That's a phenomenal number.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.840
It's almost hard to imagine.

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.400
Has he taken drugs or anything?
I have no idea.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:41.360
It is the number one public health
challenge of our time.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.840
Opioids are now the biggest
drug epidemic in American history.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.440
The number of deaths from
opioid abuse have skyrocketed

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.640
over the past 15 years...

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.760
Killing tens of thousands
of Americans every year.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.600
That's more deaths than
from car accidents and from guns.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.920
Emergency services overwhelmed.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.040
Another family burying a loved one.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.480
She overdosed in her car,
while her two-year-old daughter

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.000
was in the back seat.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
CHILD CRIES

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.920
CHILD SOBS

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.440
In certain age groups,
between 25 and 34

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.000
in the United States,
20% of all deaths

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.880
are due to opioid overdoses.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.160
Of that 72,000, the majority
are opioids and the majority

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:31.120
of the opioids are the synthetic
products, such as fentanyl.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:35.480
Fentanyl is taking the opioid
epidemic to a new level of urgency.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.120
Fentanyl, a drug more
powerful than heroin.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.800
It's 50-100 times
more potent than morphine.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:46.120
Fentanyl's so potent, you could die
with the syringe still in your arm.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.720
It's so potent,
so incredibly potent,

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.480
that it only takes a few
milligrams to cause a death,

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:55.040
and now we see fentanyl lacing
not only the heroin supply,

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.920
but we see it in cocaine and
methamphetamine,

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.880
in all sorts of drugs because
it's dirt cheap.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.080
If heroin's the devil,

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.240
to continue with
the biblical analogy,

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:11.200
I would say that fentanyl is
a Horseman of the Apocalypse

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.160
and it's the one named Death,

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.880
because it just brings death.

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.320
All right.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.600
Yeah, if you just go
straight here I'll show you

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.040
some of the more affected areas.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:02.440
Kensington is Philadelphia's
Ground Zero for opioids.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.720
And it has just been
declared a disaster zone.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:11.600
Dan's family has also
battled with addiction.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.840
He now fights on behalf
of those still struggling.

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.120
I mean, this becomes
what the neighbourhood is.

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:21.240
You see, most people around here
you're going to see are high.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.200
You know, so the neighbourhood
is almost entirely consistent

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.480
of people who are abusing.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.960
Can't walk through
this neighbourhood

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.240
without being offered drugs.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.760
It's hard to even
recognise some of these people,

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.800
it just seems like
they're in a jungle.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:44.440
And they've lost a lot
of their humanity down here.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.360
Heroin's been in Philadelphia
for decades,

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.600
this is not a new story.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:53.320
It's just that recently the death
toll has gotten so out of hand

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.960
and the farther you look,
the more you realise how truly

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.000
desperate things have become.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:05.120
I believe in 2016
we had 272 homicides

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.800
and over 900 overdose deaths.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.840
Last year we had around
300 homicides and 1,200 overdosed.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.840
So it went from being
three times the murder rate

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.720
to four times the murder rate
in one year.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.720
If you look at the charts
of what opioids are killing people

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.240
or what drugs are killing people,
in recent years fentanyl

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.000
has just taken off
literally just like a rocket,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
but now because of, you know,
how deep some of these people

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.360
are in the throes of addiction
and how high their tolerance is,

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.880
fentanyl has become introduced
slowly into the mix so that people

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.160
can get high again,
because what some people

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.120
don't realise, is that a lot
of these people who are using drugs

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.560
on a regular basis aren't
necessarily using it to get high,

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.360
they're using it to maintain
their addiction, make their headache

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.400
go away, to sort of regulate.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.120
Any amount of fentanyl would kill
most people who aren't

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.960
addicted almost instantly.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:10.040
If it continues to get worse,
like, where does it go from here?

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:16.680
I am a heroin user.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.760
I've been using heroin
for about 20 years.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:24.280
Alex is just one of the 70,000
active heroin users currently

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.920
living in Philadelphia.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.120
This ain't no life for nobody,
I mean.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:33.240
This is like the bottom
of the barrel right here.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.240
This ain't for nobody.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.160
I don't wish this on my worst enemy.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:45.600
I generally have to score about
six times a day to keep myself well,

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.200
just to be able to function, really.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.440
It's all it comes down to,
just to be able to function.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:11.560
I hope that it's fentanyl
because I've been doing it for quite

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:16.080
some time, and heroin
that's actually heroin

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.960
will not get me well.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.840
My body actually
craves the fentanyl.

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.040
It's different,
it's a different high,

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.880
it's a different feeling and I'm not
really sure what the difference is

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.920
between the heroin and the fentanyl.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:32.920
I don't know.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.120
But, it's what my body
craves and without it,

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.480
I'll be just as sick as I am now.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:46.360
I feel like it's a waste of my life.

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.560
I mean a got a lot of people
in my corner who care about me,

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:53.600
a lot of people in my family
that love and care about me,

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:57.360
and want to see me do well,
and I'm not doing nothing

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:01.760
except sticking a needle in my arm,
every day, all day long.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.320
Waste.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.640
Waste of time, waste
of energy, waste of money.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.640
It's a fucking waste of everything.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.360
It's just a waste.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:06.320
In need of a place to sleep
Alex heads to an abandoned house

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.800
that he and other addicts
sometimes use to crash.

00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.640
What's going on?

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:27.880
Not too much.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.480
It makes me do things
that I normally wouldn't do.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.880
Lie.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.600
Manipulate.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:03.440
I've never been like the person
to lie and tell stories,

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:07.000
and to, you know,
try and get over it,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.080
I was not like that.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:13.560
But my addiction has
definitely made me that way.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:19.760
Makes me feel alone,
it makes me feel vulnerable.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.120
Makes me feel scared.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.400
Makes me feel unsure
of what my purpose here is.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.360
Manchester Fire And Emergency.

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.400
Request for an ambulance
at Manchester.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.280
It's the Shell gas station,
the patient is in the bathroom.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.520
She has overdosed.

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.800
It's going to be for
a female in her 20s.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.520
My caller states he went into clean,

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:05.400
found her overdosing in the bathtub,
she was not conscious.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.840
The caller states
that she has overdosed,

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.480
the patient's going to be just
outside the church on the side.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.800
Where are the people located?

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.760
She said they're in
the middle of the street.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:14.920
Two people are overdosing.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.320
For a male in his 50s found
unconscious, not breathing.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:20.040
There's a needle next to him.

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.720
35-year-old male.
He is not conscious, not breathing.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:23.720
Overdose.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.440
I don't know what to do!
Stop talking for a moment.

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:31.280
I don't know what's happening
to this generation,

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.800
you know, I look out my window,

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.200
you know, I'm like looking

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.520
at Ground Zero,
for the United States,

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:40.080
for fentanyl,
you know, and fentanyl dust.

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.160
It's like what the heck am I seeing?

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:45.160
Truck 1811 - response.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:50.120
Outside of 340, 340 Hanover Street
for a man down, possible overdose.

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.120
SIREN WAILS

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.680
We went from 20 overdoses to 80
overdoses in a matter of a month

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.680
and we were like,
"What the hell happened here?"

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:10.920
Why did it hit us?

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:14.480
Because of synthetic
heroin, it was fentanyl.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.040
We don't have a heroin problem,
we have a fentanyl problem

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:21.720
and we really realised that
back 2015, when we got hit so hard,

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.640
but we've been chasing it
ever since, to try and get

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.520
ahead of this and it's really tough
to get ahead of something like this.

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.480
I talk to these guys all the time,
when I'm down here,

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:40.320
I'm pretty invested in my personnel
and I worry about what they do.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.320
I go to a lot of the calls that they
go on because I just want to see

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.320
how they're,
you know, handling things,

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.000
and make sure that...

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.760
I know there's going to be some
compassion fatigue, it's really...

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.240
It's really difficult to see this.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.920
I mean,
when I grew up in the Fire Service

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.400
we never saw this much,
you know, you know, death.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.680
He's not unconscious,
but you don't really know,

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:01.560
you know, when he used, you know,
what's going to happen.

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.080
They don't want to hit him
with Narcan right away,

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.320
because if they do,
he's going to be sick.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.280
Right now they want to get
him out as, you know,

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.120
as slowly as possible, so what
they're going to probably do,

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:14.400
is we'll get him in the back of the
ambulance, get him to the hospital,

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.040
and get a monitor on him

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:19.280
and probably give him some Narcan
via an IV and so on.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.720
All right, Dale, we probably
should go to the hospital,

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:22.960
get you checked out there.

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.120
Oh, I don't think I need to go
to on the side hospital.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.240
Well, yeah, you're not...

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.840
All right. Give me your hand there,
we'll take you, we're going to walk

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:39.840
you back here.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.960
Tell us what happened.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:51.000
This gentleman was seen
on the sidewalk, unconscious,

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.040
with very limited breathing,
and had just done heroin

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.080
as he reported.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:01.480
He was actually one of the honest
ones where he admitted to doing it.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.640
Sometimes they come up
and they don't admit to doing

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:08.480
the heroin and, or fentanyl.

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.360
And this time he did and we know
we've got to take him

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:15.040
to the hospital to have him checked
out and have him not lay

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:19.160
down somewhere elsewhere no-one
can find him and him passing away.

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:25.760
You go on calls like that,
in this neighbourhood,

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:28.680
and it's a lot,
it's the aftermath of -

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.280
you ask them where the needle is.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.640
"I threw it in the street."

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:34.480
OK, well now, where is it?
Who plays with it?

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:37.000
Is it an adult that picks
it up and throws it away?

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.520
Or is it a child that plays with it?

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:43.560
Then it turns into he said he did
half fentanyl, half heroin,

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:47.080
mixed in a bag. So the little baggy
that he has, where's that?

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.080
He probably threw it on the ground.

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:53.000
A kid plays with that,
sees it, is it candy, whatever?

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.400
It's that whole,
from my personal stand point,

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.760
it's frustrating,
because you see it all the time,

00:39:58.760 --> 00:39:59.960
every single day.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:12.280
Since this crisis has hit,
we go out on these types of calls

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.320
over and over and over
again, all day long.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:21.720
So 10% of the overdoses that we get
called to for an opiate,

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.840
that results in death.

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.080
So how did you make it over here?
You just walked over? Yeah.

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.840
Yeah, have you
ever overdosed before?

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:35.480
Doug, can you get up?

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.480
OK.

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.080
You gotta.

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.480
You can't stay here!

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.920
Dude, we were talking
and having like a full conversation

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.360
and you just fell asleep
like, mid conversation.

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:51.560
Douglas has obviously
overdosed on opiates.

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:55.520
He admitted to using
fentanyl, so, yeah.

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.760
This guy needs help.

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.760
He needs somewhere to go,
and you know, and like I told him,

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.800
it's like there's help
for him, you know.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.680
It's, but it's getting
to these people, and you know,

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.440
hey, I don't judge you people
but you don't know where they came

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:12.000
from, you don't know what kind
of trauma was in their lives,

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.640
so, he needs help
more than anything else.

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.560
He's sick. So...

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.560
With no increase in
budgets or personnel,

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:25.600
Manchester Fire Department now
spends 70% of their time responding

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.160
to drug-related calls.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:30.480
Layla. Layla.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.720
Layla. Wake up.

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:37.960
We got here, the police
officer came by the park,

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.080
was doing some surveillance.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.560
Gentleman here saw her passed out,

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.920
called 911, unresponsive,
we came here.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.760
She showed
all the symptoms of an overdose.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:53.920
Right away we administered Narcan,
started breathing for her.

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.600
He's going to give her another
Narcan,

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.760
so this will be the
second one that we put in,

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.400
She didn't
respond to the first one.

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.040
So we're going to put
in a second one.

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:03.200
If this one doesn't work,
they'll probably do an IV

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.120
and then put it in that way.

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:09.600
Narcan is used to block the effects
of opioids in an attempt

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.080
to reverse overdoses.

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.240
Now they're going to put
the Narcan in by IV,

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:19.000
because the two nasals got her
to come round a little bit

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.400
but not fully, so...

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:22.920
There we go. Hi, Layla!

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.840
Careful, Layla.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:38.280
It's just unfortunate, you know,
daytime at a park, you know.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.800
You know, you think you're going
for a walk in the park,

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:45.200
you know,
the next thing is an overdose, so...

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:02.240
If this crisis right now don't worry
you then there's something wrong,

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.000
you're not paying attention to it.

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.200
Every day,
people are out on the highway,

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:15.280
driving down that I-95 quarter,
to the source city or source cities

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:18.400
where these organisations
have these drugs readily available.

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:22.160
It's all day long,
it's Monday through Friday,

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:25.040
and on the weekends
and it's night-time, daytime

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:28.280
and during business hours,
the product is always available.

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:32.640
But look, New Hampshire,
as of this morning hasn't

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.640
had a heroin overdose death.

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.320
It's not heroin
that's killing our people,

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:41.280
it's fentanyl,
and it's changed the game.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:45.480
It's cheap, it's easy
to manufacture for these cartels.

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.720
They don't want to worry
about opium any more,

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:50.520
they don't have to
worry about the plant, sun,

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:53.400
water, how they're going
to grow these, growing cycles,

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:56.640
they don't worry about any of that,
they can mass-produce this stuff

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.720
in the same labs
that they have set up,

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.800
that they've used, you know,
when they were making

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:04.120
methamphetamine or any other drug,
and they're able to manufacture

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.960
it faster, and cheaper.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:11.160
Working with local law enforcement,
the DEA has identified dealers

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:13.400
operating from a park.

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.000
He's getting into a blue BMW.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.800
He picked up. He's looking around.

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.360
The blue BMW is leaving.

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.280
So you can see how this works,
we're set up in the park,

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:26.320
we're sort of
at a position where we can see

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:29.840
what's happening,
we see customers coming in.

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.160
He's coming to the park.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:35.160
They're getting served,
they're getting back in the car.

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.320
Our guys are calling it out
to the surveillance units,

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:44.240
the surveillance units are taking
them away to a place where,

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.280
whether it's in New Hampshire
or Massachusetts,

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.680
we can safely
make these traffic stops.

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:50.440
Straight ahead.

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.640
OK, we have another
New Hampshire customer, guys.

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.760
Another
New Hampshire customer arriving.

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:02.840
A vehicle possibly going on 95.

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:15.440
We're up here in New Hampshire now,
we just stopped a car that we saw

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:19.960
it pick up from that same park,
and this woman too had the stuff

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:22.000
stuffed inside of her body cavity.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.680
She's pulling
it out for the troopers.

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.000
Here's the evidence here
that they just removed

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.040
from this female here
on this traffic stop.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:44.040
Again, fentanyl,
driving up into New Hampshire

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:45.960
to pollute our communities.

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:51.560
The cartels will never change
what they're doing.

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:54.640
They have found an avenue
now with fentanyl,

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.640
where they can make so much money.

00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:00.720
The other thing is we're seeing,
and this really frightens me is,

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:03.560
the dealers are now mixing
fentanyl with everything.

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:06.760
We're seeing an increase
of fentanyl mixed with cocaine,

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:10.480
Fentanyl mixed with methamphetamine,
and if you think about it,

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:13.000
it doesn't even make sense,
because really they do

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.640
opposite things in the body
and in the brain, but to the dealer

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:20.360
they almost look at this
fentanyl now as a magic dust

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:21.480
that's just a money maker.

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.560
They think if I just put
a little bit of this in there

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:26.160
I'll be able to spread that product
further and make more money.

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:30.880
So they're trying to figure out
how to get that recipe to the right

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.960
point, where they can
still addict everybody,

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.760
but have them come back
as much as they can,

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.480
and that's really
what's happened here.

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.480
They've killed more people
than war has.

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.120
I like the person I am today.

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.800
I used to hate myself.

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:12.440
When we met Steven,
I didn't know him previously,

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:16.160
he didn't want to hear
anything about recovery.

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:18.560
He didn't want nothing
to do with the conversation,

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:21.840
even though he was kind
and sweet and respectful.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.560
I knew he just wanted to get up
and go get high that day.

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.360
He had it written all over his face.

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:43.840
I've seen it.

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:50.720
I've seen that scene, like,
and it disgusts me how I looked.

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:54.680
Couldn't even keep my eyes open.

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.840
I couldn't form a sentence.

00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:01.680
Slurring, and like,
I believe I was very close

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:04.080
to overdosing that day.

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:05.920
Runs my life.

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:09.840
I don't need it
but I feel like I do.

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:13.480
Never could get enough of it.

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.160
And it just...

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:21.680
It kind of just fed itself,
it just took everything from me,

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:27.160
and I, and I gave it, I gave
it everything I had, willingly.

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.640
It kinda took control.

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.280
I'm not the same person,
you know what I mean?

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.000
I'm not that person.

00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:44.800
I believe drugs, heroin especially,
completely changes who you are.

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:48.640
It will make you do things
that you never thought you'd do.

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:53.000
Make you into somebody
that you're not, you know.

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:59.840
Steve had hit rock-bottom
and just accepted an offer

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:03.720
from Jodi to leave Pennsylvania
for the first time in his life,

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:05.200
and fly to Florida for treatment.

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.960
Hi, Jodi.

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:09.000
Hi, Steven, how are you, dear?

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.680
How you doing? I'm good.

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:14.080
I'm so glad you made it.
How was your trip?

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:15.080
Good?

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:19.280
OK. Feeling OK? Yeah, sure.

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.240
I wasn't...

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:35.680
But I know it's not too late,
that can still make it right.

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.240
What I told them.

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:40.200
After three months in rehab,
Steve left Florida clean

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.880
and in search of a new life.

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:45.800
One without the temptations
of America's opioid crisis.

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:50.600
Steve and I have kept
in touch here and there,

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.560
throughout the course
of the last two years.

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:57.160
I know that he's still clean
and sober, I know that he's living

00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:01.080
in Kentucky,
you know, I haven't spoken to him

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.120
on the phone.

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.120
SHE KNOCKS ON DOOR

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:07.440
We just text every couple of months.

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:12.840
Oh, my God!

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:18.440
Hi. Oh, how did I know he had
some tricks up his sleeve.

00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:21.920
Hello.
Oh, hi, how are you doing?

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.240
I'm good. How are you?
I'm good!

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.200
Oh, my God,
look how healthy you look, boy!

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.880
You look amazing. Yeah?

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.280
Uh-huh.
I'm glad to see you.

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.640
I'm glad to see you.

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.400
Oh, that's awesome,
that's such a surprise.

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.440
Come check out the house.
All right. Sounds great.

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.480
So you left Florida,
went back to Pittsburgh,

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.640
the Pittsburgh area. Yeah.

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:48.880
And wasn't going to work or...

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:51.720
I had an opportunity to move here,
and I kind of jumped on it,

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:54.000
you know what I mean,
for the first time in my life

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.720
I was able to just pick up and move.

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.240
Before, I was so afraid to leave.

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:01.160
You were afraid to leave
what, afraid to leave?

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:03.520
I was afraid to leave the area
I was in because I didn't know

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:04.960
where to get the next one,

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:08.560
cos I wouldn't know where to get it
if I left. Right, it was the...

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:11.440
Right, so the drugs kept you captive
in so many different ways.

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:14.000
Yeah, yeah, it kept me there,
in the same area.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.960
Now, I had the freedom
that I didn't have to stay

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.800
around the area,
because I didn't know

00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:19.600
where I was
going to get the next one.

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:20.640
Does it exist here?

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:23.040
Like, it technically
exists everywhere?

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.840
It exists. It's everywhere.

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:28.040
Right, so,
I mean, it's happening here?

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:31.360
It definitely is here,
I've seen it a little bit.

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:33.160
I know an addict when I see one.

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:34.640
It's definitely here.

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:36.800
You have to go looking for it.
If I wanted to find it.

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.200
It doesn't come knocking
at your door or drop you off

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:43.320
like a pizza, right. Yeah, like back
home, it was right in your face...

00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:45.920
Sure. ..and it came and found you.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.360
I really like it here.

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:58.760
It's really nice.
I feel better than I've ever felt.

00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:05.280
I don't remember a time where
I felt this good about myself.

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:10.960
Two years ago, I couldn't even
dream that I could be here,

00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:14.240
doing what I'm doing,
and as happy as I am.

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:24.640
If there's one individual - Steven -
who I know that we had a hand

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:27.680
in saving his life, it's worth it.

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:30.120
Nobody's life's better
than someone else.

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.840
We all deserve a chance.

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:34.440
At success.

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:38.680
And to live.
Just some of us have lost our way.

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:46.800
It's not a poor people thing
any more, it's not an inner city

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:51.960
ghetto drug any more,
it's everywhere and it's killing

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:55.280
people left and right,
every single day.

00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.480
Something's got to be done.

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:01.280
It's got to change.

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:03.840
What's it going to take?
You know what I mean?

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:07.320
Someone can see the power like that,
losing their child too it.

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:10.280
Before they open their eyes to it?

00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:15.840
Like, something's got to give now,
or there, eventually, there's

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:17.920
going to be no coming back from it.

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:20.200
I just hope we haven't
reached that point already.

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:32.320
My story doesn't end here.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.880
This isn't the last time
anyone's going to see me.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.640
Just I...
I'm not going to die from this.

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:53.520
Like, I'm not.
Not going to die from this.

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:01.840
I want my daughter to be proud
of me, and I want my...

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:04.440
I want people to be proud of me.

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:06.160
You know, I want
to be proud of myself.

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:21.560
If I was your mother right know,
what would you want to say to her?

00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:24.000
Oh, mom, I'm sorry.

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:48.200
I know, I mean, I can't tell her,

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:53.360
"Hey, wait, couple more years I'll
get better," I can't tell her that,

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:54.840
I don't know.

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:59.200
That's what sucks about this.

00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:00.960
Tomorrow's not a promise.

00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:04.200
For her or for me.

00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:17.640
Oh, my greatest hope
is that I can beat the addiction.

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.800
That I can just go
back to being Alex,

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:25.280
that I can be a good son,
good brother, good father,

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:27.880
that's like my greatest hope.

00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:31.480
That I can beat this,
walk away from it,

00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.120
and just not look back.

00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:39.360
We lost contact with Alex,
so went back to search for him.

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.520
But he was nowhere to be found.

00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:58.000
# Gave proof through the night

00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:08.640
# That our flag was still there

00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:25.240
# O say does that
star-spangled banner yet wave

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:39.720
# O'er the land of the free

00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:49.640
# And the home of the...

00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:01.000
# ..brave? #
