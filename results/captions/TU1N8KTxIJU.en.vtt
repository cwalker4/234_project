00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.850
For thousands of years, the lands known today
as Russia and Ukraine were inhabited by nomadic

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.590
tribes and mysterious Bronze Age cultures.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.910
The only record they left were their graves.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.340
In the great open grasslands of the south,
the steppe, they buried their chieftains beneath

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.250
huge mounds called kurgans.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.940
The Ancient Greek historian Herodotus called
these people 'Scythians'.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:51.850
Their lands were overrun by the same nomadic
warriors who brought down the Roman Empire.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.550
The land was then settled by Slavs.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.080
They shared some language and culture, but
were divided into many different tribes.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.399
Vikings from Scandinavia, known in the east
as Varangians, rowed up Russia's long rivers

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.820
on daring raids and trading expeditions.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.369
According to legend, the East Slavs asked
a Varangian chief named Rurik to be their

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.749
prince and unite the tribes.

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:25.950
He accepted and made his capital at Novgorod.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.569
His dynasty, the Rurikids, would rule Russia
for 700 years.

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:37.759
His people called themselves the Rus, and
gave their name to the land.

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:45.320
Rurik's successor, Oleg, captured Kiev, making
it the capital of a new state, Kievan Rus.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:52.639
A century later, seeking closer ties with
the Byzantine Empire to the south, Vladimir

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:57.570
the Great adopted their religion, and converted
to Orthodox Christianity.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:06.109
He is still venerated today as the man who
brought Christianity to Ukraine and Russia.

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:10.780
Yaroslav the Wise codified laws and conquered
new lands.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.959
His reign marked the golden age of Kievan
Rus.

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.830
It was amongst the most sophisticated and
powerful states in Europe.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.290
But after Yaroslav's death his sons fought
amongst themselves.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.640
Kievan Rus disintegrated into a patchwork
of feuding princedoms... just as a deadly

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.450
new threat emerged from the east.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.030
The Mongols under Genghis Khan had overrun
much of Asia.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.900
Now they launched a great raid across the
Caucasus Mountains, and defeated the Kievan

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.709
princes at the Battle of the Kalka River,
but then withdrew.

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.310
14 years later, the Mongols returned.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.969
A gigantic army led by Batu Khan overran the
land.

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:03.319
Cities that resisted were burnt, their people
slaughtered.

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:11.780
The city of Novgorod was spared because it
submitted to the Mongols.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.660
Its prince, Alexander Nevsky, then saved the
city again, defeating the Teutonic Knights

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.010
at the Battle of the Ice, fought above a frozen
lake.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.430
He remains one of Russia's most revered heroes.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.980
The Mongols ruled the land as conquerors.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:39.120
Their new empire was called the Golden Horde,
ruled by a Khan from his new capital at Sarai.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.299
The Rus princes were his vassals.

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.530
They were forced to pay tribute or suffer
devastating reprisal raids.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:54.579
They called their oppressors 'Tatars' - they
lived under 'the Tatar yoke'.

00:03:54.579 --> 00:04:00.700
Alexander Nevsky's son, Daniel, founded the
Grand Principality of Moscow, which quickly

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.519
grew in power.

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:09.530
Under the great Uzbeg Khan, the Tatars converted
to Islam.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.540
A rising power, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania,
defeated the Tatars at the Battle of Blue

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.660
Waters, and conquered Kiev.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:27.100
18 years later, Dmitri Donskoi, Grand Prince
of Moscow, also defeated the Tartars... at

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:35.400
the great Battle of Kulikovo Field.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:42.980
After years of infighting, the Golden Horde
now began to disintegrate into rival khanates.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:49.710
Constantinople, capital and last outpost of
the once-great Byzantine Empire, fell to the

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.860
Turkish Ottoman Empire.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.980
Some hailed Moscow as the 'Third Rome', the
seat of Orthodox Christian faith, now Rome

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.300
and Constantinople had fallen.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:10.060
Meanwhile, the Grand Princes of Moscow continued
to expand their power, annexing Novgorod,

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.060
and forging the first Russian state.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:22.130
At the Ugra River, Ivan III of Moscow faced
down the Tatar army and forced it to retreat.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:27.760
Russia had finally cast off the 'Tatar yoke'.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:36.330
Under Grand Prince Vasili III, Moscow continued
to grow in size and power.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.680
His son, Ivan IV, was crowned the first Tsar
of Russia.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.240
He would be remembered as Ivan the Terrible.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:53.580
Ivan conquered Tatar lands in Kazan and Astrakahan,
but was defeated in the Livonian War by Sweden

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.240
and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.410
Ivan's modernising reforms gave way to a reign
of terror and mass executions, fuelled by

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.030
his violent paranoia.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.420
Russia was still vulnerable.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.500
Raiders from the Crimean Khanate were able
to burn Moscow itself.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:22.200
But the next year Russian forces routed the
Tatars at Molodi, just south of the city.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:29.250
Cossacks now lived on the open steppe, a lawless
region between three warring states.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.310
They were skilled horsemen who lived freely,
and were often recruited by Russia and Poland

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.400
to fight as mercenaries.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.910
Ivan the Terrible's own son, the Tsarevich,
fell victim to one of his father's violent

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:51.890
rages - bludgeoned to death with the royal
sceptre.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:58.240
The Cossack adventurer Yermak Timofeyevich
led the Russian conquest of Siberia, defeating

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.900
Tatars and subjugating indigenous tribes.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:09.550
In the north, Archangelsk was founded, for
the time being Russia's only sea-port linking

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:15.430
it to western Europe, though it was icebound
in winter.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:21.990
Ivan the Terrible was succeeded by his son
Feodor I, who died childless.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.960
It was the end of the Rurikid dynasty.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.140
Ivan's advisor Boris Godunov became Tsar.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:35.890
But after his sudden death, his widow and
teenage son were brutally murdered, and the

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:41.100
throne seized by an impostor claiming to be
Ivan the Terrible's son.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.930
He too was soon murdered.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:49.480
Russia slid into anarchy, the so-called 'Time
of Troubles'.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:54.430
Rebels and foreign armies laid waste to the
land, and the population was decimated by

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.140
famine and plague.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:03.340
Polish troops occupied Moscow; Swedish troops
seized Novgorod.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:12.760
The Russian state seemed on the verge of extinction.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:28.120
