00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.390
The Press:  (Inaudible)
February jobs numbers?

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.470
The President:  Well,
the economy is doing very well.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.040
We’re seeing wages rise more
than they have at any time

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.510
for a long, long time.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.840
Wages are going up first time
for many years —

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.430
I talked about it
during the campaign —

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.580
for over 20 years.
So, I’m happy about that.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.330
The economy is very,
very strong.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.420
If you look at the stock market
over the last few months,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.670
it’s been great.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.010
And certainly since my election,
it’s up —

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.570
getting close to 50 percent —
the stock market.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.319
So, we’re obviously
very happy with that.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.460
We will — I think as soon
as these trade deals are done,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.710
if they get done —

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.690
and we’re working with China;
we’ll see what happens —

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.290
but I think you’re going
to see a very big spike.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.270
A lot of people are waiting
to see what happens

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.870
with the China deal.
Mexico, Canada is done.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.710
We’ll be submitting
to Congress very shortly.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.600
And that’s a great deal
for the United States,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.540
so we’re very happy about that.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.930
And I am now, as you know,
going to Alabama.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.990
Some of you are joining me.
But I look forward to it.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.660
I’ll be meeting
with Governor Ivey.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.660
The people of Alabama, they got
hit very hard by the tornadoes.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.160
We’re stopping there,
then we’re going to Florida.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.810
And we’re going to do
a lot of work.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.450
We’ll be working very hard.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.650
The Press:  Your reaction
to Manafort’s sentencing?

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.390
The President:  I feel
very badly for Paul Manafort.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.280
I think it’s been a very,
very tough time for him.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.620
But if you notice,
both his lawyer —

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.980
a highly respected man

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.300
and a very highly
respected judge —

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.000
the judge said there was
no collusion with Russia.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.480
It’s had nothing
to do with collusion.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.590
There was no collusion.
It’s a collusion hoax.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.980
It’s a collusion witch-hoax.
I don’t collude with Russia.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.180
So I just want to tell you that
his lawyer went out of his way,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.850
actually,
to make a statement last night.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.950
No collusion with Russia.
There was absolutely none.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.730
The judge, I mean,
for whatever reason —

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.090
I was very honored by it —
also made the statement

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.630
that this had nothing do
with collusion with Russia.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.270
So, you know, keep it going.
Let’s go.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.520
Keep the hoax going.
Just a hoax.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.520
Senator Burr said
there’s no collusion.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.760
If you look at Devin Nunes
and the House Intelligence

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.910
Commission
— Committee —

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.130
they said there’s no collusion.
And guess what? There is none.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.330
The Press:  Is 20,000 new jobs
good enough, sir?

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.620
The President:  What?

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.920
The Press:  Is 20,000 new jobs
good enough for you, sir?

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.130
The President:  Well,
it’s a step.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.140
I think you’ll probably find out
it averages out.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.340
The unemployment rate
just went lower.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.970
We’re down now to 3.8 percent,

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.030
so
we had very good news on that.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.680
I think the big news, really,
was that wages went up.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.190
And that’s great
for the American worker.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.460
That’s something people —

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.490
I don’t know
if they ever expected to see it.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.100
Yeah?

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.050
The Press:  Mr. President, we’re
hearing rumblings from China

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.570
that they’re not really positive

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.610
about a trade deal
and that perhaps

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.590
(inaudible)
may not happen. Where is that?

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.920
The President:  Well,
I haven’t heard that.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.140
I think they’re doing well.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.650
But if it happened that way,
we’ll do even better.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.520
We’ll do very well either way,
with or without a deal.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.070
But you’re telling me something
that I have not heard.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.370
The Press:  Do you feel
confident

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.419
that you can get
a trade deal with China?

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.730
The President:  Yeah. Sure.
I’m confident.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.150
But if we don’t make a very good
deal for our country,

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.370
I wouldn’t make a deal.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.510
If this isn’t a great deal,
I won’t make a deal.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.020
The Press:  Are you ruling out
a pardon for Manafort?

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.240
The President:  Say it?

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.289
The Press:  Are you ruling out
a pardon for Manafort?

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.680
The President:  I don’t even
discuss it.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.840
I have — the only one
discussing it is you.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.120
I haven’t discussed it.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.440
I know that, in watching
and seeing you folks at night,

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.040
that Michael Cohen
lied about the pardon.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.400
It was a stone-cold lie.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.500
And he’s lied about
a lot of things,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.910
but when he lied
about the pardon,

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.380
that was really a lie.
And he knew all about pardons.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.130
His lawyers said that they went
to my lawyers

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.740
and asked for pardons.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.430
And I can go a step above that,
but I won’t go do it now.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.630
The Press:  Why do you think
Cohen

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.830
is suing the Trump organization?

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.110
The President:  Why what?

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.810
The Press:  Why do you think
Cohen is suing

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.020
the Trump organization?

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.820
The President:  It’s the most
ridiculous suit I’ve ever seen.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.290
Bad lawyer. I had a bad lawyer.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.570
Go ahead. That happens.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.910
The Press:  Your administration
is being sued

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.230
by Planned Parenthood
over Title 10 funding.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.500
What’s your reaction to that?

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.710
The President:  We’ll make
a comment on it later.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.980
The Press:  (inaudible)

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.820
The President:  Talk. Talk. Up.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.940
You’re competing
with a helicopter, John.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.030
The Press:  On immigration and
what’s going on in Congress now,

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.400
are you certain

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.120
that they will not
be able to override your veto?

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.740
The President:  Well, I think
that it’s going very well.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.750
The border —
we’re doing a great job.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.040
We’re apprehending
record numbers of people —

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.610
75,000 over the last
short period of time.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.880
That’s a lot of work.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.710
And with a wall,
we wouldn’t have to do it.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.370
No, I think we’re doing fine
in Congress.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.070
They understand
it’s an emergency.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.510
The Press:  Michael Cohen’s
decision to testify

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.670
(inaudible) your decision
to walk

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.370
(inaudible)
with North Korea?

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.140
The President:  Well, time
will tell,

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.620
but I have a feeling that our
relationship with North Korea —

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.990
Kim Jong Un and myself —
Chairman Kim —

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.790
I think it’s a very good one.
I think it remains good.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.530
I would be surprised,
in a negative way,

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.140
if he did anything that was not
per our understanding.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.470
But we’ll see what happens.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.250
Look, when I came in —
under the Obama administration,

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.860
North Korea was a disaster.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.480
You were going to war, folks,
whether you know it or not.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.590
You were going to war.
There was no talking.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.520
There was testing.
We didn’t have our people back.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.490
We didn’t have
our great hostages back.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.700
Now we’re getting the remains,
we’re doing a lot of things now.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.540
This was a disaster.
I inherited a mess.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.360
In many ways, I inherited —

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.600
the Middle East,
I inherited a mess,

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.300
and it’s
straightening out a lot.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.530
We’re doing very well there.
I inherited a mess.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.750
The Press:  (inaudible)

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.030
The President:  I inherited —
wait. Wait.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.430
I inherited a mess
with North Korea.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.860
And right now,
you have no testing.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.020
You have no nothing.
Let’s see what happens.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.990
But I would be very disappointed
if I saw testing.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.360
The Press:  What do you make
of the vote yesterday

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.260
in the House of Representatives
on the anti-Semitism resolution?

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.260
The President:  I thought
yesterday’s vote by the House

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.340
was disgraceful
because it’s become —

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.310
the Democrats have become
an anti-Israel party.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.110
They’ve become
an anti-Jewish party.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.210
And I thought that vote
was a disgrace

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.970
and so does everybody else,
if you get an honest answer.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.750
If you get an honest answer
from politicians,

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.480
they thought it was a disgrace.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.730
The Democrats have become
an anti-Israel party.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.720
They’ve become an anti-Jewish
party, and that’s too bad.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.450
I’m going to Alabama.
