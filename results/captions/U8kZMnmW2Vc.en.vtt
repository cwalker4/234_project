00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
Summer's almost over and school is about
to start again, but I think there's time

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.090
to go cruising up and down the streets
of Modesto one last time, so my question

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.090
today is... Where were you in 62?

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.869
Hi I'm Jeff and welcome to A Million
Movies. Today we're gonna talk about some

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.940
little-known facts about one of my
favorite summer films, the 1973 classic from

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.570
George Lucas, American Graffiti. So let's
get started.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.809
One thing about American Graffiti that
people may not know is that it's in part

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.879
an autobiographical film from George
Lucas. He took inspiration for three of

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.159
the characters from his own life.

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:55.239
The first was Terry the Toad. Terry
represents George when he was a freshman in high

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.409
school. He admits he was awkward. He was nervous around girls, and that's the

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:03.850
character that Terry represents. As
George moved into later years of high school,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.119
and then on to junior college, he got
very involved with the custom car

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.770
culture around Modesto. And that character at that time of his life inspired the

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.650
character of John. And John is involved
in hot rods and street racing just

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.610
like George was during those years. And
the final character inspired by George

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.130
Lucas's own life is Curt, played by
Richard Dreyfuss. And that that character

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.079
represents George as he was moving on in
his life becoming much more serious and

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:38.259
moving on to study at USC. The shooting
schedule and the budget limitations that

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.749
George Lucas worked under are legendary.
He shot the film about 28 or 29 days. His

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:50.350
total budget was $775,000. The
budget came from Universal Pictures and

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.539
American Graffiti was part of a series
of films that Universal greenlit in the

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.469
early seventies. They'd seen the success
of what they call sort of semi-independent

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.990
films like Easy Rider and
they decided to greenlight five films

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.369
that would be made for less than a
million dollars. The directors would have

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.550
a little bit of autonomy to come up with
something creative and different and

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.390
then they would be released and
hopefully generate enough profit to keep

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.830
the program going. The other films in the
series besides American Graffiti were

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.370
The Hired Hand, The Last Movie, Taking Off, and Silent Running. All of those were part

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.800
of this special program that
Universal Pictures have put out.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.470
Now what was going on with this was
that George had to find ways to be really

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.970
efficient both with time and money, and
he did a couple of things that really

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.380
helped with that. The first was that he
shot, often in the dialogue scenes in

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.610
particular, with two cameras. So instead of having multiple setups where he would

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.490
have to move the camera around and readjust the lights,

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.570
he worked it so he had both cameras shooting at the same time. Hugely efficient for

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.350
getting both sides of the action at the
same time, and shooting the scenes just one

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.330
or two times and then moving on to the
next one. Another way George Lucas was

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.530
able to save money was he got a crew
that worked very cheap, and a lot of

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.150
them worked for free.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.110
Instead of being paid, George Lucas
promised them that he would give them a

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.960
title credit in the movie. Now in 1973,
only department heads typically would

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.780
get their credit with their name at
the end of the movie or beginning of the

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.000
movie, so given the opportunity to have your name actually in the movie was a big

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.600
deal for a lot of these crew members and
they accepted the deal. They said that we won't

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.350
get paid and will work on your film, but we
are excited to see oour name up in

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.310
the movie. Now because budgets and time
were so tight

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.000
there are a couple of instances where
things that weren't in the script

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.130
happened and George Lucas liked what
happened and decided to keep it and use

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.970
that first take. A couple of examples I
can point to... at the beginning of the

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.500
film, for example, Charles Martin Smith
who plays Terry the Toad is pulling up

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.510
to Mel's Drive-In on his Vespa, but he
loses control and slams into the

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.190
building. That wasn't in the script, but
George Lucas liked it. It added a bit of

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.360
humor and a little bit of surprise.It
was the first take, you got it, let's move

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.070
on and get the next scene.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.959
Another example of this happening was
when Carol, played by Mackenzie Phillips, is

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.510
in the car with John, played by Paul Le Mat, and a group of girls pull up beside

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.890
them and throw water balloons. The
water balloon was supposed to hit the

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:28.729
side window next to

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.749
Mackenzie Phillips and splash her in the
face. Instead it hits her full in the

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:37.279
face. Instead of being angry like the
script called for her to be, she can't help but laugh.

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.650
George liked the way the reaction came
across. He thought it was genuine, didn't

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.960
affect the story too much, and he kept it as
a first take. A third example of

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.669
how this happened is when
Terry is trying to get money from Debbie

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:58.610
at the liquor store and Candy is waiting
for him in the car and as he comes back.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:06.469
She asks, "Did you get it... you get it... you
get... you got it." But she flubbed the line

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:10.879
and she went to George Lucas and said I want to reshoot that scene because I flubbed the

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:13.219
line. And George said no, it's fine let's go.

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:20.389
Moving on. So there are great scenes where the takes were not perfect, but they were

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.520
real, and because of the tight schedules and tight budgets, George Lucas said that's

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.699
good, that's good, let's go and we'll go
to the next shot.

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.599
Harrison Ford and George Lucas would of
course team up to make Star Wars a few

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:37.459
years later, but in this movie, Harrison
Ford's role is relatively small. And

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:41.180
George Lucas went to him and said
Harrison, I'd really need you to cut your

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.159
hair. Your hair is too long for a
character in 1962. Harrison

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:50.689
responded that my role is too small for
me to cut my hair for, but I'll make a

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:51.560
deal with you, I'll wear a hat.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.719
George Lucas agreed and
Harrison became the cowboy of

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:02.149
American Graffiti. If there's a narrator
of American Graffiti it's probably the

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:08.149
Wolfman Jack character as the DJ on the
radio. He was cast specifically because

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:13.550
George Lucas remembered hearing Wolfman Jack on the radio when he was in high

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.050
school living in Modesto and he wanted
him to be part of this movie.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.469
It reignited Wolfman Jack's career. He
became a pretty big

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:27.110
celebrity in 1970's because
of his role in American Graffiti. And

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.490
there's actually a scene in this movie
where Wolfman Jack makes a prank phone

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:37.129
call to a pizza place, and on the other
in the line it's actually George Lucas

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:38.080
answering the phone.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.219
One of the things that we might
not think is unique today, but was unique

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:57.280
in 1973, is actually the soundtrack.
Before American Graffiti, and a few years

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:03.789
earlier, Easy Rider did this is well,
soundtracks were primarily music written

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:09.759
specifically for that movie. With
American Graffiti, George Lucas

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:13.659
identified 40 different songs that were
of the time period...

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:17.949
that you would have heard in 1962, that
he wanted to include in the film and use

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:21.250
that as the soundtrack. The studio
really had a problem with that.

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:26.169
Getting the rights to all those songs
and paying the fees to use them was

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:31.029
going to jack up the costs and the budget of this film. They really pushed back hard.

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:36.009
It wasn't until George Lucas' friend,
Francis Ford Coppola, decided to come on

00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:40.900
as a producer and throw in more money
to the budget that the studio agreed to

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:46.629
let George Lucas use the songs that he
wanted to use. Now today, using oldies in

00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:53.080
a soundtrack isn't as big a deal. You'd
hear the songs in movies from The

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.360
Big Chill and Dirty Dancing.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.889
The songs are being used in movies all the way to today, but in 1973 it was pretty unusual

00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:04.990
and was something that the studio really
pushed back hard on. In the sock hop scene,

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.710
you've got Steve played by Ron Howard
dancing with Lori, who is played by Cindy

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:13.150
Williams. As they start to dance, you can
hear the announcer make an announcement

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.110
that this is a snowball dance.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:27.300
"Last year's class president, Steve Bolander, and this year's head cheerleader, Lori Henderson."

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.540
A snowball dance is one where two people
start to dance and then they break apart

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.870
to find other partners, bring them on to the
dance floor, and then after a few seconds

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:37.410
those two couples break apart and bring
other people dance floor. That continues

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:42.990
to repeat until everybody's back on the
dance floor. Now the dialogue between

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:47.520
Steve and Lori is so intense that they
never break apart even though they're the only

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.300
two people dancing. So if you watch the
kids in the background, you can actually

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.480
see them start to get a little anxious
waiting for their turn to join the dance.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:02.190
The executives at Universal were not
crazy about the title American Graffiti.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:06.420
They didn't think the public would know what it meant and they wouldn't be able to sort

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.190
of associate it with this film. They
suggested a movie title...

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:16.710
Another Slow Night in Modesto. Francis Ford Coppola suggested Rock Around The Block,

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:22.050
but obviously George Lucas
pushed back and was able to keep the movie

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:27.210
with his original title in mind, which
was American Graffiti. One of the great

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:31.920
scenes of American Graffiti was actually
improvised. It's the scene towards the end

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:37.530
where John and Terry are talking after the
drag race where Falfa has wrecked his car.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:43.440
Terry comes over to congratulate him and
John says... he was admitted he was losing.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.200
"No, I was losing it."

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:54.090
"What?" "He had me, man. He was pulling away from me but just before it crashed."

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:57.630
"You're crazy. I saw it now, you creamed him from right off the line. I think he never had a chance."

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:03.840
That scene was scheduled to be shot at
another time. The actors hadn't prep for it,

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.380
so when it got moved up, they totally
just improvised the scene and shot it right

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:11.820
there. To give the movie more
authenticity, George Lucas really wanted to

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:16.950
make sure there were lots of cars on the
streets, so he put out a call to the

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:22.110
people in the cities where they shot
requesting that if they had older cars,

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:26.940
classic cars, to come out - and some were
paid $25 a night for the use of their car.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:32.250
The locals really got into the
shooting and made the the shoot

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:37.320
more like what cruising was like in 1962.
Between takes, there were even some drag

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.220
races that happened up and down the
streets, so it was sort of like going

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:46.380
back in time. The entire scene was like it was in 1962 even though it was 1973.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:53.460
George Lucas was able to include an
internal reference, an inside joke, in

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:58.080
American Graffiti. The one that most
people know about is the license plate

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.860
on John's car. If you look at it it says
THX 1138.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:09.000
This is a reference to George Lucas'
previous film which was THX 1138, and

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.410
that license plate is now actually on
display at Skywalker Ranch, the

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:18.390
Lucasfilm's headquarters in Marin County.
There's a pretty famous story about

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:24.360
Universal's reaction to seeing the film.
They really didn't like it. They didn't

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.540
know what to do with it and, in fact, they
put it on a shelf for six months while

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.010
they tried to figure it out.

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:34.470
They went and did a screening of it at
Northpoint Theater in San Francisco and

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:39.660
the crowd loved it, it got a great response.
The head of Universal was actually there

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.170
and even after seeing the crowd response,
he still didn't know what to do with it.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:49.170
Francis Ford Coppola, who had come on as a producer of the film, immediately turned

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:53.010
to the head of Universal and offered to
buy the film from Universal on the spot.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:56.640
Universal had second thoughts. They
decided to release the film,

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:02.280
and i'm pretty sure they're glad they did.
It made 35 million dollars on a

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.510
$775,000 investment. They made 35
million, which is a pretty good turn

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:10.830
around and really cemented George
Lucas' career as a writer and a director.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:15.780
The poster for American Graffiti has a very distinctive style,

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:19.890
and if you recognize that, there's a good
chance you're like me and we're a reader

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:25.380
of Mad Magazine when you were young. The artist of this poster is

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:31.530
Mort Drucker, and Mort Drucker was a long
time artist on Mad Magazine. One sort of

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:36.270
the coincidental thing about this was in
addition to drawing this poster, Mort

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:42.030
Drucker had to draw the art that went
along with the the the parody that they

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:46.680
did of America Graffiti when they did the
parody in Mad Magazine. So he did the poster

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:52.950
and the parody. After American Graffiti,
Ron Howard and Cindy Williams were

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:57.780
actually reunited in television. Ron
Howard had gotten the role of Richie

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:03.390
Cunningham on Happy Days, and when Garry Marshall decided to do a spin-off of two

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:08.490
girls from Milwaukee, he brought in
Cindy Williams along with his sister

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:12.810
Penny Marshall to be Laverne and Shirley.
So there are actually great episodes of

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:17.910
Ron Howard and Cindy Williams reunited
on the cast, on the set of Happy Days.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:22.320
So those are my little known facts about
American Graffiti. Thank you for sticking

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.390
through it. I really appreciate it.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:29.790
Let's go to the countdown. Today we
talked about The Hired Hand, The Last

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:33.780
Movie, Taking off, Silent Running,

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:38.490
Easy Rider... I mentioned The Big Chill and
Dirty Dancing.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.510
We referenced THX 1138,

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:47.010
and of course we talked about American
Graffiti. That brings our total down to

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:55.050
999951. That's it for today. I really
appreciate you joining me for this

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:59.700
episode about American Graffiti. If you
enjoyed this video, I hope you watch my

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.480
other ones and perhaps subscribe to this
channel. That would really help me out. If

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.640
you have any comments, feedback,

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.420
or suggestions... anything... please put in the comments section below. I'd love to read

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.470
that, and hopefully I'll see you on the
next episode of A Million Movies.
