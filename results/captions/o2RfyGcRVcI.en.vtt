00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.760
Let me show you around the ship

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.000
Compass Deck

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.920
radar scanners, and the funnel back
there. antennas everywhere.. antennas...

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.930
antennas..

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.079
Heading down into the bridge

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.420
The ship has a computer system which connects all the essential machinery and equipment together

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.390
Most important equipment of course is the coffee machine

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.100
We also coordinate all the ship activities from here, so

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.240
literally we are in the command center
of the ship.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.220
Aye aye Captain!

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.479
The accomodation has many floors

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:49.369
All of them have some cabins and facilities. To get
around we can use the elevator or we use the

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:55.820
stairs. Our ship has nine floors which we
call "decks". The higher ranking officer

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.320
lives in the upper decks, the crew lives in the lower decks. Follow me and I'll show you around each deck.

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:29.230
This is a standard size cabin, we have our own fridge, a queen size bed, a couch, a coffee

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.920
table

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.329
our own bathroom, a desk, computer is not included. Some facilities we have our

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:37.329

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.760
A Basketball court

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.020

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.500
Two laundry rooms and two drying rooms

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.220
Bonded Store

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.100
Why is the rum always gone?

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.180
Vegetable room

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.180
Meat room

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.500
Fish room

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.940
Cook: My goodness...

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.100
Galley

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.420
This is our duty messroom

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.620
Here we have the officer's messroom

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.820
The officer's pantry

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.420
Into the galley again, this is our chief cook

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.240
His cooking oil / sauces, and on the left side here we have his cooking equipment.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.840
This is the crew's pantry

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.040
And lastly, the crew's messroom

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.380
And outside here is the lifeboat

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.640
Conference room

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.080
Ship's Office

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.840
Emergency Headquarters

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.800
Changing locker

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.880
And now i'll bring you guys out to the main deck

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.820
Moving towards the aft we have the aft station

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.760
The big drums are hydraulic mooring winches

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.720
And the small round blocks are bollards and bits

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.840
Here you can see the wash from our propellers

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.620
Now we will start heading towards the forward station.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:04.980
Our ship is 323 meters long so at normal
walking speed it takes about 4 to 5 minutes

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.860
to get from the aft to forward station

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.460
So even though we are speeding up right now, it still takes a long time

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.080
here is our one additional life raft at the forward

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.280
at the forawrd station now you can see the white forawrd mast

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.040
and then this is our anchor, the hawsepipe

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.840
This enormous thing is our spare anchor

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.360
The shackle is twice the size of my hand!

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.640
Head on up onto a lashing bridge

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.140
Our ship has 20 lashing bridges and 9 cargo holds

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.680
These lashing bridges and cargo holds are used to securely store containers

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.350
through the watertight door now we're heading
towards the engine room. We're using the

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:44.120
underdeck passage which runs underneath the main
deck so it is also 323 meters long

00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:01.670
This is our 68,000 kilo-watt main engine. If the bridge is the brain of the ship then the

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:06.640
main engine will be the heart, it not only
propelles our ship but also provide the whole

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.700
ship with electricity

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.240
Our massive steering gear with two hydraulics

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.800
And.. that wraps up the tour for my ship,

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.800
Hope you liked it!

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.800
