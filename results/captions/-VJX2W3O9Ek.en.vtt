00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.740
Tak!

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.400
Across Scandinavia, the average price
of everything from a knitted roll neck

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.320
to pastries from the local bakery are
some of the highest in the world.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.060
Scandinavia is a region in northern Europe
that was historically made up of three kingdoms:

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.500
Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.680
They’re united by their Viking heritage
but also their shared reputation

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.900
as one of the most expensive
regions to live and visit.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.880
Whether it’s buying a car or a TV,
consumers in Scandinavia

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.220
pay some of the highest
prices in the world.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.080
Even buying groceries is costly with all
three countries’ food and drink prices

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.280
above the European average.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.600
All three countries also have
a standard VAT rate of 25%.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.580
Amongst all the European nations,
only Hungary has a higher rate.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.019
Heading to the bar is also pretty pricey.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.880
In Norway, having a beer or glass of wine
will cost 2.5 times the EU average.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.520
Both Norway and Sweden have state-run monopolies
on alcohol which helps keep the prices up.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.300
This social market model, rather than
a liberal market model like in the U.S.,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.200
is common across Scandinavia and helps
explain why the cost of living is so high.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.640
Scandinavian countries have large welfare
states with their social expenditures,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.920
as a percentage of GDP, among the highest in
the world and this requires high levels of taxation.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.240
Sweden has a top rate of
personal income tax of over 60%,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.440
while Denmark’s is more than 55%, both of
which are well above the OECD average.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.540
In Denmark, if you want to buy
a car you have to pay anywhere

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.340
between 85% and 150% tax on
top of the cost of the vehicle.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.540
And the taxes don’t stop there.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.300
Let’s say I want to buy
a sweater in Denmark.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.140
I pay 300 kronor for it, but how much of that
money actually goes to the vendor?

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.840
Well, first there’s the 25% VAT -
leaving the seller with 240 kronor.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.480
The clothes shop also has to pay a
minimum 22% of corporate income tax.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.760
That means that a big portion of the money I paid
for my sweater goes to the Danish government.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.560
Not to mention there’s a hefty
payroll tax on employees' wages

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.760
and the store still has to pay for rent, electricity,
and cleaning - all of which are taxed, too.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.360
These taxes mean that for
Scandinavian businesses to make a profit,

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.060
they need to charge their
consumers high prices.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.980
For some companies, this has proved too
much of a burden for their business model.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.720
The world’s biggest furniture company
IKEA was founded in Sweden

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.280
but has moved its headquarters
to the Netherlands.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.180
Through corporate restructuring, the business is
now owned by a non-profit Dutch parent company.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.020
In part due to the high taxes in Sweden.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.000
But according to some experts,
Scandinavia’s social democrat tendencies

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.840
have led to a strong social cohesion and
has helped provide political stability.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.640
This, in turn, has made their economies safe
havens for outside investors -

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.540
which is one reason why the Danish, Swedish and
Norwegian currencies called krona are so strong.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.840
This can be tough on tourists with the
exchange rate doing them no favors.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.900
If the cost of living in
Scandinavia is so expensive,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.580
why then are its citizens some
of the happiest in the world?

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.500
In the past five years, Scandinavian countries
have regularly topped the World Happiness Report.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.160
That’s an index that measures overall life
satisfaction based on different contributing factors.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.600
Some experts attribute these high satisfaction
levels with Scandinavia’s large welfare state

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.040
which they say ensures financial security,
job security, and economic distribution.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.680
In return for high taxes, citizens get free
state education, very cheap child care,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.460
a functioning public transport
and a free health service.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.400
But a large and expensive social welfare
state doesn’t necessarily mean the best.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.820
For example, Norway is the only
Scandinavian country that ranks

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.440
in the top 10 for adult education
levels, amongst OECD countries.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.820
And yet Scandinavians remain
happy with the status quo,

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.560
living within a social corporatist economy
that provides reliable economic welfare.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.380
Having a beer at the end of the day does
cost a small fortune, but for people living

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.380
and working in Scandinavia, high prices
provide a quality of life that’s worth paying for.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.400
