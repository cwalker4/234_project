In addition, Putin has blackmailed Trump which again is obvious to anyone who has followed this story. At the Helsinki meeting with Putin, Trump had a secret meeting over two hours in which no Americans were allowed in except Trump's interpreter from whom he took her notes. After that meeting, you can watch a video of Putin and Trump exiting that meeting. Watch it very closely. You will see Putin beaming, a huge smile, absolute total confidence that he has Trump where he wants him and then, look at Trump very closely. He looks shattered and shaken. Putin then glances back, smiling and smirking again. Trump then goes to the microphone and denies once again that Russia had anything to do with waging war against Hillary and engaging in interference in the 2016 election. Trump chooses to say this in contradiction to all our intelligence agencies which have massive evidence to support the fact that Russia did. Ask yourself this question: why? Why is trump denying this reality? You see, Putin has threatened Trump and members of his family and others in the Trump administration with a ton of dirt including videos of Trump and others with Russian or Eastern prostitutes....this is a common KGB, now FSB, tactic down to control and often destroy opponents. The story is very detailed and I have not enough room to say more here but you can find a lot of this evidence by those who have written about Trump, given interviews, etc. This is worse than Watergate or Iran-Contra. This is treason committed by Trump, his family and others. Let's wait and see what happens. The problem is that, like the Iran --Contra investigation.....the powers that be will want to keep the true story hidden from the public for fear of discrediting our whole political system and how the Rich, Powerful, Banksters especially dictate policy and such.", "28 years ago I began my career as a stockbroker.  Like many professions background checks are needed.  My life was analyzed through questionnaires and their own searches... financially and personally.  It seems one can have a shady past marked with financial troubles, personality conflicts and proven associates of bad character and still be president. How can this be allowed is beyond me.", "ABC News (Australia), I have to commend you on an accurate view of our troubling political scene here in the US.  We have this fake news company, Fox News, which constantly lies about Trump and his cronies and has led many people astray of any kind of truth.", "This is excellent investigative journalism. This journalist is also a top-notch interviewer.", "As anybody with a brain would know: if Trump was totally innocent of everything, then he would simply let the investigation continue. But he fired Comey who is a Republican as is Mueller, btw. And then, the same day, meets with two high level Russians in his office, disallowing any American Press in, tells the Russians he got rid of Comey because he 'was a nut-job' and smiles as if these guys are his best two friends in the world. A photojournalist from Russia (the only journalist allowed in the WHITE HOUSE OFFICE!!!! No less.....) took the famous photo with the Russians smiling and approving of Trump's move. Has anybody here seen the videos of wild celebrating in Russia after Trump won the election?? It was amazing. They were so jazzed in Moscow that the partying was wild. Trump is a traitor to his country and has committed treason. Perhaps she of you have seen a video where a Republican Congressman makes a comment with Paul Ryan present where the congressman says amazingly how much Trump loves Putin....and being on camera....Ryan hushes him up. So the Republicans are in league with a treacherous, treasonous traitor, scumbag and dirtbag, conman, pathological liar, criminal, megalomaniac, and huckster......excusing all of his behavior just to secure rightwing Supreme Court Justices, Tax breaks for the Rich, and legislation which eliminates some sanctions of Russia.

A recent medical Journal paper entitled \"Can Oral Infection be a Risk Factor for Alzheimer disease\" gives some pretty interesting proofs.    There are now many studies linking mouth and brain Candida Fungus.\n\nThis means that the preventative and possibly cure (somewhat) is good Oral Hygiene.   Nothing is better for your Oral Health than a practice called \"Oil Pulling\", which is basically just swishing clean vegetable oil in your mouth for 20 minutes per day.  I do this daily while showering after brush and floss.   Mouthwash would also be prudent in patients, although I do not use it.\n\nThere are hundreds of Oil Pulling videos for dental hygiene so I will not explain it more except to say that some oils taste good such as sesame, coconut, and dandelion.   The most popular is Coconut Oil and I think many are already claiming Oil Pulling helps dementia.   If you read this, now you know why and have read al;l the evidence (if you read paper listed).\n\nNOTE:   EVERYTHING I SUGGEST TO PREVENT AND CURE IS SIMPLY GOOD ORAL HYGIENE.    LESS CANDIDA FUNGUS IN YOUR MOUTH WILL LEAD TO LESS CANDIDA FUNGUS IN YOUR BRAIN.   SCIENCE!!!!!!!\n\nNow go brush your teeth and spread the word.   There is enough evidence that we should take this seriously, and the only thing we all need to do is keep our teeth bright white.\n\nPlease Thumbs this up so others can find it, \n\nand possibly comment elsewhere about this study..

I was getting forgetful, so I started taking it, and all of a sudden I could access info I read many decades ago. I also grow it in a pot indoors, since I live in Minnesota. I use it in recipes. Cheap and easy to grow once you get a piece of root, I also grow ginger the same way. It also has been know to show promise with the condition (which is not a disease since you don't catch it from anyone else). But, since I'm not a doctor, I am not telling anyone to use. I use both in recipes, since I like Asian food and cooking and they are cooking herbs very common in Asian cooking. For those who don't know India is in Asia.", "Rather than provide a drug which costs money to treat Alzheimers, why not stop consuming items that cause it. Aluminum is found in high concentration in the brains of Alzheimer sufferers. Aluminum has been known for over 50yrs to be a neurotoxin. We get it from soda cans, beer cans, aluminum foil on the BBQ, aluminum packaging like Capri Sun, etc. What he forgot to tell the audience is that Aluminum first went into industrial production just before the first Alzhiemers case was reported. We dont need another drug, we need to stop coming into contact with toxic metals like aluminum and mercury.", "I was interested until he mentioned that they need to create a new drug to cure it... why not use the money to investigate how it can be prevented?", "Mopping up water without turning off the faucet. May well be the secret motto of drug companies nowadays. Cure will always come in the form of finding and addressing cause, turning off the faucet. Not drugs. Like all other so-called 'diseases', there's a cause of Alzheimers. Work on finding it, instead of a magic bullet that doesn't exist. Same for cancer. \n\nVirgin coconut oil (MCT oil) shows tremendous promise in supplying the brain and neurons necessary nutrients in lessening and reversing Alzheimers symptoms, along with other neurodegenerative diseases. This would be a decent starting point for finding cause. Drug companies however, aren't interested in cause. Alheimer's eradicated=$200 billion yearly gone for them. Sad, but that's the current mindset which naturally develops in a profit driven healthcare system.", "Big Pharma isnt interested in cures. They want human repositories for their poisons that dont cure so people keep coming back for more until they die. A lot of money to be made in sickness, but not much in healing.

Finland leads the world statistically and that can be specifically traced back to the 1970s when they started a low cholesterol drive to cut the rate of heart disease. This they did by 75%, but they ended up with an Alzheimer epidemic instead. Cholesterol has a major protective function in the brain, so by cutting good and bad sources, they created the problem they now have. Coconut oil can be converted to ketones used as a type of fuel like glucose in the brain, so LCHF or Banting lifestyle and white fats recommended. Western countries have much higher rates of Alzheimer's due to their use of cooking oils like canola, sunflower and others, which is why olive oils and mediterrean diet also recommended, together with fish oil, or omega fat supplements, b12 and other nutritional substances like co-enzyme Q10. There is hope and you can eat the right way and add the supplements your brain needs. Dump the Statins in exchange of natural products like Red Rice Yeast Extract.

They need regulations to protect consumers and employees from businesses.", "Everything he said is exactly right. My family did turkey farming for 15 years, the last 3 of those being with Butterball. Those last 3 years were horrible. Butterball follows the Tyson Plan, which is exactly what John said except the gladiator system actually deducted our pay because our birds were in the top 3 best and that wasn't \"fair\" to the others, thus it was even worse than described. Not was the best grower's pay bad, the worst growers were paid a terrible amount for their birds, plus OUR bonus distributed among 10 or so people (so just crappy all around). Last year we started an Association hiring a lawyer to negotiate with Butterball. Afterward they sent out threatening letters, tried to get us to sign disgusting contracts, and sent out officials secretly to inspect the farms to try and find something to hold over them. I know more than 70 farmers who grow for Butterball. Most have a spouse with a second job and several have to take on one themselves in order to stay out of bankruptcy. That's THREE (3) incomes just to feed your family and pay bills, noting that most of those families are only two people. Now consider that farming, especially animal farming, is a 24/7 job. This is not 9 to 5 work go home and watch TV until bedtime. This is dirty, physical labor, paired with constantly fixing machinery, filling out paperwork, and implementing the WEEKLY new rules sent down by the head company. Forcing everyone to install new computers, vents, fans, wall, etc in order to keep us in debt where we couldn't say boo or risk getting no birds, bad birds, or shadily changing their pay scale. During our time with Butterball my father slept an average of 4 hours a night because we could NOT AFFORD for ANYTHING to go wrong and turkeys have to be monitored constantly. None of us have had a vacation in 15 years either. \n\nThankfully we dug ourselves out of that dirty lying stealing company and now produce free range, non-GMO, antibiotic free chicken eggs. And when I say free range I mean they run around outside all day long and go inside when it gets dark. Many chicken and egg producers SAY the birds are free range but to them that means multi-level houses when the birds never step outside. Financially, we aren't out of the woods yet. We still have a long way to go to pay for the new loans we had to get in order to redesign our farm. However, the company we work with now is actually paying us for the hard work we do. We got lucky getting to work with someone else. But that was a one in a million chance. Everyone else just has to sit down, shut up, and work their lives away in total misery. Crossing my fingers that more of these reports come out so that all my friends in the farming industry can be free from such deplorable businesses.", "This show has taught me more than my school ever has.", "I knowthis makes mea horrible person, but when that farmer said \"the struggle has been very real\" I died", "This is no doubt capitalism at its ugliest.

That divide has been economic but also racial, with minorities claiming a disproportionately small share of the nation's substantial wealth.\nAnd yet, a 2013 Pew Research Center study showed that half of white Americans surveyed do not feel that African Americans are treated less fairly by the police, employers, doctors and others.

Racism didnt simply go away after the 1964 Civil Rights Act like many of us perceived in history class, it evolved. The government distributed crack in predominantly-black neighborhoods in the 70s & 80s and then started the War on Drugs that catalyzed such tremendous growth in our prison populations. In many states, employers wont hire people with an arrest record (let alone a conviction), drug convictions prevent them from receiving federal aid for college, & felonies remove their voting rights (we call that voter suppression). It backs people into a corner where their only chance to be successful in life is to steal or sell drugs. In any society, with poverty comes crime, and people are products of their environment (just ask a redneck). This is what leads to young black men being racially profiled by law enforcement. And when the black youth got angry & organized enough to form the BLM movement and exercise their constitutional right to protest & spread awareness, the government labels them a domestic terror threat while white supremacists exit the shadows and return to the national spotlight.

It's also the reason why the Canadian law-mandated safety manual (green book) for construction is 3 inches thick lol. In Canada, they treat work-place accidents as crime scenes. If it's found that someone got hurt because they weren't trained properly, the company would then be sued for a MINIMUM of $500 000, and criminal negligence charges would be slapped on em for good measure.\nI'm not even a Crane operator, but I can tell how a crane accident is gonna go down minutes before it happens just by what the operator is doing right before and what equipment was used. Usually, cranes tip because operators are unaware of how drastically their load capacity drops once they lower the boom below 45 degrees, especially when you've got alot of the boom extended out. There's load-plaques that show capacity at every possible extension and angle in the cab of every crane, though, so there's no excuse for fuckups like these, short of sheer incompetence. \nSure, a 90 ton crane can lift 90 tons under IDEAL conditions, but the second you take the boom below 45 degrees the load bearing capacity of the machine gets cut to less than half, and even more depending on how far you've got the boom out or are using a jib attachment. That's why at the crane company I used to work at, they used their 90 tonner for large jacuzzi installations quite a bit, because they have to extend the boom out so far to get the tub over the house, and the real capacity on a 90 tonner under those circumstances would be much less than 90 tons. I've even seen them haul out their 300 tonner (their biggest truck-mounted crane) just to move a 20 ton air conditioner to the top of a somewhat tall office building.\nFor reference, NONE of those cranes you see failing are anything close to 90 tonners lol. They're all 35 and below. The general rule of thumb for crane ops is you take a crane out that can carry much more than you expect it to if the job requires that you reach the load to the other side of something that's tall, like when you have to lift a big ass jacuzzi over to the other side of a big house with the crane parked in the street. That's why truck-crane accidents rarely ever happen in Canada.
